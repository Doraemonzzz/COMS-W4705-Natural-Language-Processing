resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday , 28 march 1996 .
welcome
i bid you a warm welcome !
approval of the minutes
the minutes of the sitting of thursday , 28 march 1996 have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
points 16 and 17 now contradict one another whereas the voting showed otherwise .
i shall be passing on to you some comments which you could perhaps take up with regard to the voting .
i will have to look into that , mrs oomen-ruijten .
i cannot say anything at this stage .
we will consider the matter .
mr president , it concerns the speech made last week by mr fischler on bse and reported in the minutes .
perhaps the commission or you could clarify a point for me .
it would appear that a speech made at the weekend by mr fischler indicates a change of his position .
i welcome this change because he has said that he will eat british beef and that the ban was imposed specifically for economic and political reasons .
could somebody clarify that he has actually said this please , mr president , because it is a change of views .
mr sturdy , i cannot see what that has to do with the minutes .
mr president , on exactly the same point as mr sturdy has raised .
if commission fischler has made this statement , then he has said that it is not a matter of public health .
mr smith , the same applies to your point ; it has nothing to do with the minutes .
mr president , again on bse .
if mr fischler has changed his views does this mean the commission has ?
this was actually referred to in the minutes .
he said that any funding would also go towards supporting workers who had directly lost their jobs .
so far nothing has come of this in any scheme that has been put forward .
does this mean the commission has changed its view on supporting workers who have lost their jobs through this scare ?
i note that there are no comments on the minutes .
( parliament approved the minutes )
now that is clearly a fraud on the french taxpayer as well as a fraud on the european citizens .
can we ask the bureau to look into this fact .
can we ask you as president to make sure that is happening with the taxpayers ' money for which we are collectively responsible .
mr tomlinson , would you please give me the documents concerned .
then i will look into the matter , both in the presidency and with the other organizations in question .
you yourself know best how difficult and complicated the legal situation is between parliament and the firms contracted to build the hemicycle .
after all , we have in you an expert who is in any case closely concerned with these matters .
mr president , i should like to deal very briefly with two matters .
thank you !
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents at its meeting of 11 april 1996 pursuant to rule 95 of the rules of procedure has been distributed .
no amendments have been proposed .
mr president , i should like to ask a question .
we were too late to hand it in , but it has been discussed with a number of members . it is the following .
i think that in view of present events in the middle east , we ought to ask whether the council can make a statement on wednesday afternoon about the way things are going .
we note that the situation is changing every day . we see that the french government has sent a mediator .
we hear nothing from the presidency . nor have we heard anything , unfortunately , from the commission .
that is reason enough for us to be put in the picture .
i should like to ask you to see whether it is possible for the italian presidency to do that on wednesday afternoon .
we recognize that the agenda is very full .
then we could deal with chernobyl some time later .
i offer that as a suggestion , mr president .
if you would like to arrange things some other way so that we do not need to take chernobyl off the agenda that would suit us just as well .
mr president , my group is certainly of the view that what is happening in the middle east is very significant and that we cannot let this week with parliament in full session pass without any response or discussion .
could we leave it to you , mr president , to see whether the council is prepared to make a statement on the middle east and what is happening in the lebanon ?
could we then look to you to see what is possible .
i am reluctant , as i know many of my colleagues are , to remove chernobyl from the agenda , as suggested by mrs oomen-ruijten .
however , it would be possible for us to come back to the issue of chernobyl which does not have such immediacy although it is the tenth anniversary .
we could take this in two weeks ' time , whereas the issue of lebanon is crucial at this moment .
perhaps , mr president , we could ask you to look at this with the council and see what would be possible .
mr president , i am glad to support mrs oomen-ruijten 's suggestion , supported by mrs green - with one slight reservation .
that is no problem for me ; i think it is a good initiative , but again europe is absent .
that was previously the case in the crisis between turkey and greece , and then mr holbrooke rightly said :
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i think it is important that we should discuss the situation in the middle east this week .
we all agree on that .
but i think it is equally important that we discuss chernobyl this week .
i cannot support this proposal .
the whole world is talking about the tenth anniversary .
a major conference was held in vienna .
there was a tribunal .
and then we say we will postpone it to whenever .
i really think it would show parliament in a poor light if we do not discuss it on wednesday .
there are various other options .
we can listen to the council on the subject on wednesday morning , but please not just in a week 's time .
at a time when the whole world is discussing chernobyl and the effects of that disaster , we in this parliament cannot say , we shall hold back and say nothing about it !
mr president , i have already given you the reasons why the council should make a statement about the bombardment of lebanon .
that would be a bad sign for the intergovernmental conference and for the future of the european union .
but i think , like mrs roth , that we cannot make the subject of chernobyl and the subject of the middle east compete in the ' free market for news items ' .
we must seek out the opportunity to discuss both subjects .
mr president , like previous colleagues , i believe it to be absolutely essential that the council make a statement on wednesday about the middle east situation , particularly in southern lebanon .
what is happening there is worrying and distressing because the whole peace process that has been under way for several months could be threatened .
we should also remember lebanon itself , which has been ravaged for many years , under the domination of one foreign power while part of its territory is occupied by another .
ladies and gentlemen , this is one of the cases where there is no satisfactory solution because someone is bound to be disappointed and any decision is bound to be to the detriment of someone 's interests .
let me describe the situation to you as i see it .
first , let me please establish whether the council is prepared and in a position to make a statement .
but it would be neither right nor a good idea to shorten that debate since the italian president-in-office of the council will be here on wednesday morning .
so the only possible compromise is to postpone the gonz&aacute;les &aacute;lvarez report and cut question time by half an hour .
i realise that to do so would be at the cost of members who have questions .
that is regrettable .
it is not that we will satisfy everybody this way , but if we are to try to find a solution , i am convinced that is the only possible one .
the order of business for this week is thus established .
energy efficiency
overall , this proposal is very vague and general and , sadly , contains no real topics or projects .
the legislative level has been disregarded entirely , although the evaluation of save i showed that 80 % of the successes of that programme were achieved by means of legislative measures .
many of the proposals for directives and action programmes planned by the commission have for some obscure reason never seen the light of day .
for instance , it has been estimated that the introduction of calorimeters would have yielded savings of approximately 4.75 million tonnes of crude oil units and a co2 reduction by the year 2010 of 12 million tonnes per year .
the savings from the introduction of an energy certificate for buildings would have been far higher than that even .
this list could be extended forever .
it is clear that whenever the practical will is not there , subsidiarity is brought up as an argument .
that is why the responsibility for achieving the efficiency target and at the same time reducing co2 lies with the community , which in fact takes action when an objective can be achieved more effectively by community measures .
strictly speaking , it is the credibility of the eu that is at stake here .
the commission and the council have constantly declared how vital it is to reduce co2 and to save energy .
the council has set objectives in a series of resolutions , for example in its resolutions of 16.9.86 and 29.10.90 and in the commitments it made in rio and berlin .
so far , however , there has been no more than grandiloquent announcements and reams of paper .
the commission itself estimates that the co2 emissions will rise by up to 8 % in the period from 1995 to 2000 .
so one may well ask : is the community actually taking its own practical declarations of intent and obligations towards its citizens , and towards the international community , seriously or is this just a theatre of the absurd ?
if it really is being serious , words must finally be followed by deeds .
we urgently need genuine measures to combat the greenhouse effect and increase energy efficiency .
the situation is too serious to allow for any further delay .
a beginning might be made with a genuinely ambitious save ii programme , as proposed by the committee on research , technological development and energy .
that is why the amendments tabled by that committee should quite definitely be adopted .
the objection that such programmes can only be disruptive given the current economic climate and unemployment level in many member states is unacceptable and merely ridiculous .
for in addition to their environmental dimension , they can also have a substantial positive impact on the economy .
according to the commission , apart from its effects on the quality of life , these savings would also have positive effects on employment .
let me repeat that i deeply regret that the committee did not accept my proposal that we extricate ourselves from this unholy cooperation procedure and aim at a co-decision procedure .
it would have been more sensible for parliament always to apply the co-decision procedure .
if we give the money we should also be able to say that we would like to see legislative measures .
for that is the decisive point here .
mr president , firstly i congratulate mrs bloch von blottnitz on the amazing feat of achieving consensus in the committee on research . technological development and energy .
i think she is well placed through her excellent report to achieve consensus in the plenary session of parliament .
energy efficiency is of fundamental importance both to the environmental and the competitiveness policies of the european union .
as far as the environment is concerned , we are a long way off meeting the targets which we set ourselves in rio .
we are suffering widespread climate instability because of that failure .
as far as competitiveness is concerned , we see a reprehensible and incredible waste of money throughout the european union ; billions and billions of ecus are being wasted in energy usage that is not necessary .
think of the purchasing power which those billions could release to our economy .
larger firms are , of course , aware of this .
our target through this programme has to be the smaller firms and individual households .
they must make the decisions which will allow us to save that energy and save that money .
if we look at the history we see very rapid action following the oil shock in 1973 .
since then , however , there has been major regression tempered only by the recession which has hit most of our countries .
the energy / intensity use in most of the european union is worsening .
that is unacceptable .
the save i programme was very small beer , a very small amount of money .
it is being evaluated , fortunately , before we move on to save ii .
one would have hoped the lessons from save i would be learnt .
that is not so , as i shall explain later on .
one of the lessons from save i was that far and away the best thing to do is to bring in binding legislation which member states have to enforce .
there were ambitious plans for legislation .
very little of that legislation has appeared .
it is true that we have legislation on the efficiency of boilers , fridges and freezers , labelling , and there is more to come .
but that is not enough .
we know that the main obstacle has been the predictable resistance of manufacturers .
they have no vested interest in energy efficiency and that is clear from their stance .
let us look at the lessons .
firstly , legislation is what works .
secondly , you must have targets and you must monitor them .
the target in save ii is not ambitious ; 1.5 % increase year-on-year is not ambitious .
i would like to see an indicative programme issued by the commission and monitored throughout the member states .
another lesson that is important , not from save i but from the regional programme , is that you must incorporate measures on energy efficiency into the regional work of the eu and its policies .
they help impoverished regions .
of course the same would apply to third countries .
i would like to see far more emphasis in our dealings with countries in central and eastern europe and the mediterranean areas on energy efficiency .
one area which must be emphasized above all is transport .
transport takes almost half the energy cost and it uses almost half the oil .
we have not done enough in that sector .
then there are domestic and industrial appliances , insulation for the heating of homes , and in some parts of the eu for the cooling of homes .
there is a good home rating scheme developed in my own constituency which should be far more widespread .
it must be made easier for third parties to finance energy-efficient measures and for the growing industry of energy services to be helped . this makes us competitive , remember .
combined heat and power is another very sensible measure which needs encouragement ; as do education and information throughout the eu , particularly to the target groups .
we need millions of people to make decisions which do not seem obvious to them .
employment would be greatly helped by an extension of energy efficiency .
this has been proved in study after study .
i am therefore deeply disappointed at the negative attitude of the council of ministers which cannot even be bothered to get a proper legal base for the save ii programme .
that is indeed reprehensible , given the urgency .
i think we will see this week a very clear expression of the will of the european parliament representing people in every member state .
that will is to say : ' let us have much stronger measures for energy efficiency ' .
save ii is nowhere near ambitious enough .
it has not learned all the lessons from save i. it is a very limited , minimal approach but it is absolutely essential that the council of ministers knows that the european parliament is backing it very strongly indeed .
mr president , on behalf of the european people 's party i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur , both on the content of her report and on the consensus that she fostered in the committee .
that consensus has led to a number of common conclusions which i will not spell out in detail now .
however , it is worth pointing out once again that with this programme we are seeking to promote environmental improvement and to increase the competitiveness of europe 's undertakings .
the commission 's proposal to treble the resources for the save ii programme , as compared with the save i programme , is certainly encouraging .
save ii seems to be pointed towards the second of those two paths . however , it would perhaps be better if the funding could be allocated as evenly as possible over the whole duration of the programme .
save ii endeavours to strengthening pilot actions that were undertaken in the first programme and also makes provision for new actions .
as has already been said , the programme ignores the positive results that have stemmed from legislative measures and the possibility of achieving a further increase in energy efficiency via the same route .
although i do not believe that legislation would help us down that route , i feel that we should not disregard the experience that we have gained from the past at a very heavy price .
i would therefore advise the commission to look for a middle way , so as to provide an impetus to small and medium-sized enterprises in particular , as i said before .
however , it would also be useful if the commission were to take account of the need to achieve convergence between the member states in the area of energy efficiency .
mr president , i support mrs bloch von blottnitz 's report .
she introduced it with her usual efficiency .
it is important that we support the continuation of the save energy efficiency programme with a budget of ecu 120m for the period from 1996 to 2000 .
the save initiative , which dates back to 1991 , is one of the cornerstones for the european union policies to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 .
the renewal of the save programme may be timely as the european commission reports that the carbon dioxide target is being exceeded by 5 % .
indeed , according to estimates , carbon dioxide accounts for 50 % of the greenhouse gases now present in the atmosphere .
between 1991 and 1994 the save programme funded a total of 203 pilot projects in the energy efficiency field .
in ireland alone we undertook 12 pilot projects with the assistance of save funds .
so i fully agree with the objective to improve energy efficiency by a further 1.5 % per annum within the european union .
it is important in this context that the save initiatives should be coordinated with other european union energy initiatives such as thermie and synergy .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am pleased first of all to compliment the rapporteur on the excellent report on save ii .
this report makes a contribution to the difficult but important battle for a sustainable environment and a sustainable development of our economy .
for the group of the european liberal , democratic and reformist party sustainable development means a situation in which the natural raw materials are so used that future generations can also make use of them in the same way .
liberals start with their own responsibility and do not shuffle it off on to succeeding generations .
that of course means that there must be sustainable management of natural resources . there is a price-tag on pollution .
so the environmental costs of consumption and production must be made visible in the economy .
the committee on energy has approved 35 amendments , four of them from the group of the european liberal , democratic and reformist party .
i should like to explain two of them .
a shift , ladies and gentlemen , in the use of energy sources , in particular in the direction of renewable energy sources , could make these figures considerably more attractive .
that should be encouraged in the framework of save ii .
it is essential to apply modern energy technologies and to switch to cleaner industries in eastern europe .
that is good for the environment and good for the economy and benefits both the union and third countries .
that is what makes this collaboration so significant .
mr president , it is certainly appropriate that at least one representative of a nordic state should take part in this debate on the programme for the promotion of energy efficiency .
there is quite a lot of snow too .
in the north , particularly in a country dominated by the paper industry , industrial users of course consume an enormous amount of energy , but we also use a lot of energy in heating .
this winter has been particularly cold , and this has meant that considerably more energy has been used than normal .
of course , we cannot do anything about the forces of nature .
we can , however , do a lot to improve energy efficiency . in finland , for example , there are currently enormous quantities of wood , of waste wood , which nobody uses .
and in order to make use of these forms of energy , we need money for research ; there is also plenty of room for improvement as regards all the existing forms of energy .
the directive on refrigerators , which the next speaker mr macartney has reported on , may even now be being debated in the council .
indeed , parliament has only just debated this directive , and it must be said that in many developed countries the objectives set out there do not represent anything new .
we need to set more ambitious objectives and ensure that the old , wasteful sources of energy are modernized .
the save programme is of great importance in all this improvement of energy efficiency , but in itself it does not help as much as it could .
i hope that this save ii programme will be adopted but there is much that could be done to improve it .
i have to say that it is a bit like motherhood .
everyone supports energy savings , everyone is in favour of motherhood .
but where are the real supports .
the commission has failed with these proposals to give us real support , key legislative proposals .
parliament has stepped in and , correctly , pointed this out .
we do not have very much time left before the year 2000 to achieve the objectives we have set ourselves .
let us have some real legislative proposals this time around .
the most important thing we have done recently is to evaluate the save programme .
we have done an excellent evaluation and have come up with the real result that you need legislative proposals .
we need teeth to make the save proposals sink in .
unless we get teeth the member states will not do the work . we will not get the results we need .
we have to harmonize with other programmes .
we have to harmonize with thermie and synergy and we have to export these ideas to third countries , particularly the east .
but let us show an example ourselves .
where are the save programmes for the european parliament ?
where are the energy saving programmes for the commission ?
let us do some real work ourselves on our own buildings .
buildings are shooting up here and in brussels .
where are the real energy saving proposals there ?
we pontificate about what third countries and peripheral states should do all the time .
let us do something real here in the heart of europe where we have money .
let us do it legislatively and with fiscal instruments .
i do not accept that we cannot use fiscal instruments .
it is about time we got back to using them .
mr president , i wish to respond to the point made by mrs stenius-kaukonen that those of us who live in the more northerly parts of europe suffer from colder winters !
it is something which is fairly obvious when you state it but clearly it has profound implications for the people who live in those climates .
a lot of lessons could be learned by our people and these could be applied right across europe to everybody 's benefit .
later on in this parliament we shall be returning again to the subject of domestic freezers and fridges , which is a subject that often causes eyes to glaze over , i have to admit .
but when people realize how much energy the fridge or the freezer in their house consumes all the year round , i think they will realize this is important .
mr president , almost three years ago today i stood in this spot and delivered the opinion of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection on the save i programme .
save i , which parliament criticized for having insufficient finance and ambition , detailed 13 legal actions and standards that would be undertaken .
in practice , only four directives emerged and it is unacceptable that the present proposal makes no reference to the failure of save i as a legislative programme .
for instance , we still have no directive on energy efficiency of buildings .
at the time of rio there was great excitement .
we believed in those targets . this programme does not go far enough to meet those targets .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , allow me first of all to thank the rapporteur , mrs bloch von blottnitz , for her very important report , and also the draftsmen of the opinions of the parliamentary committees .
the save i programme which ended in 1995 was initially devised as an energy efficiency programme . however , as it progressed it became the cornerstone of the european union 's strategy for reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
however , we have also been guided by another factor , namely the lack of progress on the question of an energy tax .
and it is precisely that which has led us into developing save ii as a wider and fuller initiative .
mr president , commissioner , i would like you to tell me when you will be presenting the legislative proposals . you said it would be very soon .
we are calling for legislative proposals and you say they have already been implemented . surely that is not the case .
the directive merely refers to the measures , while it is left open to the member states whether they implement them or not . but they have not done so .
that is precisely what we need in save ii . after all , it is useless simply to leave the implementation of such measures to the member states .
it is true that the forecasts and estimates for the next 200 years provide grounds for claiming that energy reserves are plentiful , but they are for the most part located outside the european union .
and the energy dependency of the european union , already of the order of 48 % , could reach 70 % by the year 2020 .
maintaining the security of eu countries , and world stability and peace , require clear-headedness , a vigorous approach and a search for worldwide energy cooperation .
mr soulier has provided some figures which indicate how the general energy picture is likely to evolve in the immediate future .
i will not repeat them , but i do agree .
in the light of those figures the synergy programme assumes particularly great importance because in focusing on third countries and providing them with assistance it will help those countries formulate and implement energy policies of their own .
mr president , let me by way of introduction remind you again of the position of the committee on budgets , namely that no important measures should be financed from the general budget without an appropriate legal base .
this differentiated breakdown shows that the synergy programme gives a greater financial contribution to the administrative costs than to the operational projects .
the companies certainly benefit from the energy charter and certainly have the financial resources to finance the secretariat .
for that reason , the citizens of the eu cannot be asked to continue paying for this .
the committee on budgets already pointed out when the treaty was signed that it must not imply any significant budgetary burden on the eu , and that , we believe , is how it should remain .
we need a change of energy policy .
let me briefly raise three aspects . firstly , the 25 billion tonnes of co2 emissions we puff into the air every year damage our climate and destroy our natural environment .
secondly , the potential of nuclear energy is limited .
we already have some 120 000 tonnes of radioactive waste and nobody knows what is to be done with it .
thirdly , of course there is a growing energy demand because everyone on this earth has a right to quality of life .
that is why the commission 's proposal to develop a strategy of cross-frontier cooperation is most welcome .
however , a programme of this kind , which after all accounts for ecu 50 million , must also satisfy certain requirements .
co2 emissions are a cross-border problem and require a european approach .
the eco-tax is an excellent means for that .
the netherlands are at present the only member state to have energy taxation , but co2 emissions are not only a european but a world-wide problem .
i should also like to say , along with another colleague , that nuclear safety does not belong in such a programme . we have other programmes devoted to nuclear safety .
there are great problems in trying to export nuclear technology to developing countries . for example , we have not solved the problems of waste .
finally , concerning the rational use of energy and sustainable development , we need to be developing them through fiscal instruments in particular .
i agree with a global approach on this level . we should follow the rio agenda .
the co-ordination of energy policies in relation with third countries is a priority and should not just be seen as an appendix but as part and parcel of any future european energy policy .
i hope that the recent proposal by the portuguese foreign minister to hold regular euro-african summits can open up opportunities in this area .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , first of all i should like to thank mr soulier for his marvellous report .
mr president , if i have understood correctly , the ministers for transport have recently been doing some soulsearching about the future of goods transport by rail . it is about time too .
the directive on the interoperability of the trans-european high- speed rail system and its history and content still do not bring that dawn .
seven years have gone by between the initiative and this second reading .
what is the result of all that ? movement backwards , which the often strained relations between the national authorities and the rail companies seem to confirm .
' with the amendments made by the council to the proposal for a directive the aims sought by the commission in its original proposals have been drastically altered .
that is the end of the quotation , with my apologies for the involved wording .
that quotation is the commission 's conclusion which above all stresses once more the wish to take account of users ' needs and expresses regret at the council 's attitude .
the second reading must make it clear to the council once more by the proposals for amendment the essence of what is involved in the matters we are discussing together today .
europe 's rail systems must be compatible .
they must work together . they must share the same technical standards .
they must do that if europe 's railways are to fulfil their potential to shift passengers and freight from our congested roads and airspace so that we meet our environmental objectives .
secondly , we must realize our potential to become more competitive as europeans and to foster growth and employment .
however , we can only build europe 's railways for the 21st century if we standardize our national railway systems that were created in the 19th century . it will cost money .
this evening i wish to focus on the need for passengers to have easy access to the whole of the european high-speed network . that includes passengers with disabilities .
a case in point is the marvellous , high-tech , high-speed eurostar train which now serves my constituency and links london to brussels and paris . marvellous , unless you are a disabled passenger .
it applies too to the high-speed lines . furthermore it is just as important for the systems to be interoperable also in the sense that they become more attractive for the user .
mr president , i am speaking on behalf of mr van der waal , who cannot he here because he is ill .
the commission 's proposal on interoperability of the european network for highspeed trains has been drastically altered by the council .
instead of striving for a european network of high-speed trains the accent is now placed more on preservation of the existing national high-speed networks , which have been made interoperable only where necessary or where desired .
adaptation of existing or planned infrastructure costs a lot of money - money which , incidentally , is not available , amongst other things because of the emu criteria .
with hindsight it is very much to be regretted that european standards were not in force before the construction of the national high-speed networks .
those difficulties are apparent if we bear in mind that certain factors - environment , users and management - vary from one country to another .
that is why the council moved away from the original commission proposal and , in some respects , parliament 's amendments .
it is therefore desirable that interoperability be gradually achieved in relation to transfrontier traffic , the rapid transport of goods and , at a later and none-toodistant stage - the whole of rail transport .
here there is an implied attitude which is debatable from the point of view of a broad vision of the process of developing the networks and providing services .
to be specific , from a reading of the provisions of this proposal for a directive the lack of interoperability emerges as a fundamental problem as it creates internal frontiers which hinder freedom of movement .
the interoperability of the networks is therefore a question to be solved first. previously .
once the problem has been expressed in those terms it must be recognized that as long as there is no interoperability there will be no freedom of movement .
but a statement like that is in itself little more than tautology .
the cumulative deficit of the sncf , which is supported by the state , that is the taxpayer , is ff 175 billion .
the commission cannot , however , support the amendment from mr soulier - amendment no 12 - because it would complicate the interoperability framework which we are establishing , and that contradicts the efforts to achieve simplification .
so we are happy to collaborate in the introduction of a uniform system for transport of dangerous materials for the whole territory of the european union .
such a uniform system must guarantee an acceptable level of safety and eliminate existing obstructions to free movement of goods between the member states in the field of means of transport .
the second point concerns informing the competent authorities in advance where transport of extremely dangerous goods is concerned .
the railway accident in flanders on thursday last week made it clear once again that in spite of good safety standards accidents can never be ruled out .
that applies also to transport of extremely dangerous goods .
we think that in the event of an unexpected accident involving particularly dangerous transport operations it is important for the competent authorities to be informed about the operations .
i appreciate that it is not easy to lay down practicable criteria for the concept of ' extremely dangerous goods ' . for that i shall rely on the creativity of directorate general vii .
it is also proposed to transpose into community law the rules contained in the rid regulations as they are applied to international rail transport to include operations within member states . these moves are strongly supported by my group .
while we as a group can support the position adopted by the rapporteur and the committee on transport and tourism , we have some reservations about the number of derogations introduced by the council , particularly in article 5 .
we believe this could have the effect of putting rail at a disadvantage compared to other modes of transportation .
the aims are clearly to achieve the highest level of safety and to establish a single market for these transport services within europe .
for instance , it has been made compulsory for the member states to notify the competent authorities so that they can alert the emergency services throughout the territory to be crossed .
the proposal is intended to remove existing obstacles to free movement of goods between member states . having the same regime for all transport of dangerous goods obviously adds transparency and clarity for the user and ensures greater safety .
clearly , the commission recognises that existing national regimes for the transport of dangerous goods have developed separately and diversely . we naturally appreciate that harmonization cannot be achieved overnight .
the council increased the flexibility provided for in our original proposal .
mr president , i thank the commissioner for his answer , although he must understand that i do not agree with him in all respects .
but i would ask him to be rather more specific in answering my question about how the commission will manage with the concept of ' tunnels with characteristics similar to the channel tunnel ' .
by their very nature these tunnels are huge pieces of infrastructural development . by their very nature they must be secure for the purpose of the transport of dangerous goods .
decision on urgency
madam president , the committee on fisheries has agreed to accept urgent procedure and to ask for this to be placed on the agenda for the procedure without debate .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
the report will therefore be put to the vote on friday morning .
the deadline for tabling amendments is 12 noon on wednesday .
madam president , the committee on external economic relations yesterday unanimously adopted the request for urgency on the report by mr pex , as you rightly said .
we hope that the house will do the same .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
this item is also placed on the agenda for friday .
the deadline for tabling amendments is 12 noon on wednesday .
the aim of the programme is to assimilate and increase the efficiency of customs procedures and customs administration .
many of the working methods and organizational structures used by the national customs services vary widely and urgently need to be brought more closely into line with each other .
at first reading we adopted a number of amendments to the programme , many of which the commission has incorporated in its amended proposal .
the council , however , has made it clear in its unanimously adopted common position that it has different priorities from those of parliament .
we had a detailed discussion with the commission and the council in the committee on whether or not we have community customs .
the recommendation before you at second reading lays emphasis on the further development of the european internal market into a proper european home market with open internal borders and a common external border .
particular attention is to be paid to the associated countries of central and eastern europe .
as a first step towards an eventual common customs administration , customs officials are to wear the twelve-star symbol of the community to make it clear that they belong to a common service .
in my opinion , this last point is particularly important and could be especially useful in protecting the community 's financial interests .
the people who will be most affected by this development are freight carriers , who are liable to the customs administration for the proper execution of the transport procedures .
there are huge sums of money involved here , and the carriers are required to provide the customs office with security for their liability .
cases of fraudulent evasion of customs duties which are discovered by the customs authorities result in enormous penalties for the carriers .
in the netherlands alone , carriers have had to pay almost ecu 900 million , the situation in germany being almost as bad .
for europe as a whole , the figure is estimated at around ecu 3 billion , and it is often only fairly small-scale firms which are involved .
individual firms have faced demands for more than dm 50 million , for example , and for many this can spell financial ruin .
in calling for the customs services to be fully computerized as quickly as possible , parliament therefore hopes to help prevent fraud and protect jobs .
in the field of legislation too , efforts are being made to achieve harmonization between member states , and there must also be a certain homogeneity between them in the way they interpret this legislation .
but i should like to place particular emphasis , as most members of the committee sought to do , on the fight against all forms of fraud , and fraud arising out of transit operations in particular .
we stress that sufficient funds should be made available under this programme to enable the declarations of intent to be expressed in action in the field .
such are the conclusions of the committee on economic and monetary affairs and industrial policy and at this point i should like to thank our rapporteur and chairman mr von wogau .
i repeat , if we want to be credible we must combat all the many forms of fraud which abound within the union and which prompt nationalist reactions .
madam president , a single market needs common protection .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i should first of all like to thank the rapporteur on behalf of my group for the great commitment he has shown over a number of weeks while working on this recommendation .
the community has uniform customs legislation and should therefore ensure that customs controls are applied equally strictly everywhere .
i think the programme you have proposed will be helpful here , but you will also have to monitor it in practice .
i therefore welcome the fact that the commission has said it is prepared to try to help importers and exporters by considering ways to simplify procedures .
i think that this form of partnership between economic operators and customs authorities is a very good idea and should definitely be followed up .
madam president , the issue we are again discussing today - in the hope of being able to arrive at a definition of it - is of the greatest importance for the european internal market .
it is very important to define the powers of customs officers , and these have , of necessity to be uniform throughout the union .
we firmly believe that this proposal may represent a vital step towards the completion of the internal market .
madam president , the customs 2000 programme is very important and it is still more important to launch it with realistic objectives .
in this respect parliament is perhaps attempting to achieve rather overambitious objectives too quickly .
for a long time to come we will be aiming rather at speedier cooperation between customs systems than at a separate common customs system - not least because there are still very sensitive issues associated with the external borders .
the greens wish to stress the importance of customs cooperation with third countries and the european union 's immediate neighbours .
in our opinion at least one-fifth of the customs 2000 funds should be used to develop those countries ' customs institutions and cooperation with them .
madam president , both the proposed programme and mr von wogau 's report are something of a curate 's egg .
one last point .
the planned accession of the countries of central and eastern europe will mean extra work for the european union , and we should start now to prepare the ground for future cooperation with the customs services of these countries .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , mr jarzembowski welcomed the fact that the programme specifically includes economic operators .
but if only we had included them in the past and heeded their warnings , we would not now be planning to extend the t1 system to cover the visegrad states .
to put it bluntly , there is no point in having talks with economic operators or with the customs authorities if we do not draw the appropriate conclusions .
if all that happens at the end of the day is that a political decision is taken which cannot be justified in practical terms , then even the most constructive talks are useless .
nevertheless , we would of course welcome the continuation of talks as part of this programme .
i have a comment to make about amendment no 16 , which has caused some misunderstanding because it calls for direct customs control to have priority over every other method .
this does not mean , of course , that every lorry has to be unloaded at the border or its destination , which would , as we all know , be quite stupid .
the aim is not to find a scapegoat and hold them responsible for as long as possible .
the aim must be to take deterrent and preventive action , and this is only possible with controls .
noone was in any doubt about that .
and there is no doubt that the romantic symbol of gold stars on the customs officers ' new uniform is going to do anything to solve this problem ...
the measures which must be taken are well and truly enshrined in articles 7 and 8 .
will those measures be taken ?
will there be really any interest among the member states to take these measures ?
will not many top officials in various member states be interested in making sure that there is a certain freedom in terms of fraud so that competition takes place and their products can be sold ?
to what extent can member states be made responsible for ensuring that provision already taken should actually be executed ?
otherwise the whole of this can have no effect and the customs 2000 programme will just be another document worked out by the commission and the council of ministers .
madam president , i have only a few brief comments to make on a report whose conclusions i largely support .
this means that the individual member states should undertake to achieve at least a certain standard of control but that they will be at complete liberty to introduce a stricter system of checks if they so wish .
in the debate in the committee on economic affairs mr von wogau also confirmed that the criteria would be of this minimum nature .
i should like to point out that there is considerable concern in my country that the single market may make it more difficult for us to carry out effective customs to prevent the importation of drugs .
an overwhelming majority of the population want us to be able to step up inspections if we so wish .
for this reason i am also critical of the formulations in amendment no 3 .
finally , madam president , i have my doubts about the value of customs officials ' uniforms bearing the eu logo with the twelve stars .
i therefore regard the twelve stars as a worthless symbol .
i admit , however , that this issue is completely insignificant and it does not affect my positive attitude to mr von wogau 's report .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur , mr von wogau , for the important work he has done .
as stated in the report , the vital precondition for creating a genuine internal market is that there has to be joint protection of external frontiers .
bearing in mind those fundamental objectives , the commission put forward this text on 6 april 1995 , and it was first considered by the house on 25 october last .
of the 34 amendments you then tabled , 23 were taken up by the commission in its amended proposal of 21 november , and 14 adopted by the council in the common position of 22 december 1995 .
similarly , this decision does not of itself represent the main instrument devised by the commission to tackle serious but specific problems it has identified in relation to fraud , particularly as regards transit .
those issues will be specifically dealt with , in separate proposals , in a different context .
nonetheless , the ' customs 2000 ' programme will provide a framework particularly suited to developing a genuine policy of prevention to combat customs fraud .
and it is in the light of those objectives that the commission has weighed up the amendments tabled in your draft decision on second reading .
the house proposes incorporating 23 amendments into the common position of the council - on which the commission gave its view on 11 january .
that being so , the commission undertakes to include those issues in the work that will be done in implementing this programme .
to conclude , the commission welcomes the great interest that the ' customs 2000 ' programme has generated in the house and the active support our proposal has been given .
thank you , mr monti .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
industrial policy for the pharmaceutical sector
ladies and gentlemen , this report is sure to provoke very widely differing views on the industrial policy we should pursue in the pharmaceutical sector .
i should like to pick up on this point .
mr bangemann , we were at the emea conference in london together , and i assume that you , as a forward-thinking consumer protector , will also support these demands .
i would like to stress that certain passages in this report have been watered down as a compromise , to ensure that it would receive a majority .
this is , of course , not the ideal way to produce a report , but in the end the wording is always some sort of compromise .
we are also calling for a responsible export policy in the pharmaceutical sector , with the introduction of a code of conduct .
let me be quite clear about this . a modern industrial policy must not be geared towards either producers or customers .
it must be geared towards society and its legitimate needs , and above all , mr bangemann , it must have the courage to innovate .
in my view , the report should be adopted as it stands .
i hope that it will be widely supported , and i would be delighted if it helped to give the people of europe confidence in our ability to protect those who are ill .
madam president , i should like to start where the rapporteur has left off .
we have to recognize , however , that the idea of having an industrial policy for the pharmaceutical industry is rather different from the other industries we have dealt with in the past .
we have to acknowledge that the pharmaceutical industry is intimately linked to health issues and to the national social security systems of our member states .
when we determine an industrial policy - which we should do for the pharmaceutical sector - we have to recognize that it is a much broader sector than the other industries we have looked at in the past .
at a time when governments are trying to cut their budget deficits , we have to look at the costs involved in buying the pharmaceuticals for the health of our nations .
to ensure that we have healthy citizens we have to ensure that drugs are as inexpensive as possible .
the socialist group supports an industrial policy .
we do not believe that we should cherry-pick .
we want to see a comprehensive industrial strategy for the european union and we do not believe we should only look at industries which are in decline .
therefore , we welcome the commission 's proposal to look at the pharmaceutical industry .
there is global competition in this sector .
we recognize that with global markets we have to look at this key industry and ensure that it is competitive within the european union .
that is why the report we have produced looks at a number of key issues .
we want to encourage innovation .
we want adequate protection of new medicinal products .
we want the availability of medicinal products for citizens throughout the european union .
but in addition - and we see no contradiction in this - we want the development of an eu-based generic pharmaceutical industry as a positive contribution to competition .
there is no contradiction if we recognize the importance of the pharmaceutical industry for the health of our citizens and for our national social security systems .
so , we want a well-balanced industrial policy but we want to make sure that this balance recognizes the responsibility that the pharmaceutical industry has in europe .
it has its industrial responsibilities but also a responsibility towards every single citizen that may need to use these products in the future .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the commission report has been out for two years now , and the house has discussed it in great detail over that period .
it is a good thing that mrs soltwedel-sch&auml;fer can now tell us that the wording of various passages has been watered down , because the proposals she originally put forward were completely unworkable .
this is not the right way to go about things .
we feel that the commission report paints a relatively accurate picture , but the proposals which it puts forward still need some improvement .
we agree with the socialist group 's analysis here .
the most controversial subject in the committee was the issue of generic medicines , on which there was fierce lobbying from the industry .
this is one area where we can actually achieve something , and i think it would be a good way to promote greater transparency and more competition on the market .
there are a number of factors which they have completely overlooked , however .
first and foremost , there is the importance of medical progress .
research and progress in the pharmaceutical industry depend entirely on having a watertight patent protection period .
secondly , we must not forget that the market for generics is a purely commercial one and involves only products which are commercially successful .
thirdly , the comparison with the situation in the united states does not hold water .
the united states does not have price regulation , so the pharmaceutical industry can recover its research costs more quickly .
the solution lies in free pricing , not in cutting down on the patent protection periods .
the american market is also not fragmented as it is in the union , where the protection period is calculated from the first time a licence is granted in any of the member states .
finally , the innovative pharmaceutical sector is one of the leading generators of employment .
it has a much greater multiplier effect on other sectors and itself employs 530 000 people in europe , 80 000 of them highly skilled .
apart from her desire to reduce the patent protection periods , it is the rapporteur 's views on genetic technology and biotechnology which cause me the greatest anxiety .
i hope that when you vote , ladies and gentlemen , you will put the interests of medical progress and a competitive pharmaceutical industry in europe first .
madam president , in relation to this report it is important to emphasise the special nature of the pharmaceutical industrial sector .
it is umbilically linked to public health and , as point e demonstrates , we should first of all aim at the objective of providing the whole population with safe and efficient medicines .
this undeniable priority comes up at community level against the differences between the health systems and social security regimes in the different member states and various national peculiarities .
on one hand it is a sector which illustrates in the extreme and with many contradictions the process of private transnationalisation leading to the destruction of national industrial sectors .
the case of portugal would be a perfect example of this accelerated and perverse evolution which has made the production and trade in medicines completely dependent on the outside .
it is obvious that the pharmaceuticals industry demands huge resources and calls for extremely burdensome research spending .
however it is very important to prevent that research and development from being exclusively at the service of private interests rather than mankind as a whole or public health .
the delicate nature of these questions and the dimension of the interests at stake are both reflected in the report which should deal less with the market and prices .
but that is how things are .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , what we are doing here is developing a european industrial policy for a particular sector .
in the pharmaceutical sector , we need to reconcile a number of different interests .
first of all , there is our common heritage of biodiversity and acquired scientific knowledge , the latter being a basic prerequisite for the development of pharmaceutical products .
secondly , there are the interests of society , since our social security and healthcare systems are greatly affected by price levels in this sector .
thirdly , there is our common interest in lasting innovation for the future , which means that we will always need industrialists , and they in turn will always need a challenge .
big profits are not enough , otherwise we would have seen a flood of industrial innovation in europe in recent years , which has clearly not been the case .
those who have invested in the sector , however , quite legitimately wish to see a return on their capital .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , this is a commendable report , despite a rather unfortunate title .
is not an industrial policy for the pharmaceutical sector reminiscent of the planning we used to see in the iron curtain countries ?
the argumentation without discussion is cast in the same mould .
while it is admittedly impossible to harmonize the management policies in the pharmaceutical sector , there are certain major subjects of concern which this report fails to address .
a specific approach to this problem is essential due to the appearance of new forms of nonepidemiological illnesses .
a medicine exists because it provides treatment , irrespective of whether it is profitable or not .
japan and the united states have awarded orphan drugs special status .
in europe there is a legal vacuum in this area .
this question of orphan drugs leads us to the whole matter of public health .
europe should endeavour to promote this protection of life at all levels , without excluding the so-called risk groups or the victims of rare diseases .
a healthy notion of public health must allow every individual to obtain treatment according to his real needs .
this communication from the commission seems to be seeking to ascertain how best to restrict the supply of health care .
this is unacceptable .
when you then add to this a failure to understand the market economy , the potion becomes all the more poisonous .
just one additional question : how do people view the merger of ciba-geigy and hoffmann-laroche , which is a result of this report ?
madam president , i wish to record my thanks to the rapporteur for her important work on this key industrial sector in the european union .
we have no real public health strategy for the european union , and this is an important omission , which perhaps we can rectify in other pieces of work .
the rapporteur has rightly drawn attention to some of the problems of the sector and particularly to the way in which companies in the united states of america are in many ways making gains .
the area i wish to concentrate on particularly is responsible self-medication .
there is also an important cost element here and sometimes these two objectives can be in contradiction .
this leads me on to the important role of the pharmacist in the sale and prescription of over-the-counter medicines .
we need effective labelling , effective and comprehensive testing and pharmaceutical advice if patients are to make a genuine , informed choice about over-the-counter prescriptions .
it is difficult to balance the need for adequate regulation and the safeguarding of patients ' rights .
now , perhaps that might be more tenuous were we to look at it in a worldwide context .
i welcome the report .
i welcome the innovation .
i do not agree that we need a pharmaceutical industry with price controls as they are at the moment , but this is an important contribution to a key-sector policy development .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as a practising pharmacist and someone with research experience in the pharmaceutical industry , there are two points that i should like to make .
the most obvious thing that the medical profession does is to advise patients and help them with self-medication .
the transition of medicines from being prescription-only to being available over the counter must be carefully monitored .
only those who have no idea of the huge costs involved in researching new drugs could be in favour of granting earlier licences for generics .
the comparison with the united states , it must be said , simply does not hold water .
as has already been pointed out , patents are protected for 16 years nationwide in the us , whereas in europe , protection only takes effect once the product has been licensed in the various individual countries .
i am not in favour of making generics prescription-only , since i think it is better to leave them to market forces .
madam president , few reports have been the subject of such intensive lobbying by the industry concerned and i think this is always instructive .
the absence of a free market in pharmaceutical products is regrettable .
i suspect that the cost of moving to a free market would be much lower than we imagine but , of course , once the psychology of restricted markets has taken hold it is hard to get over that .
but if we need a free market we also need normal patent procedures .
why cannot we allow , as they do in the united states , companies producing generic medicines to begin their development work in advance of the expiry of patents ?
we know that this work is done for european companies in turkey and in iceland , for example .
it is costing us jobs here in the european union .
there is more than a little hypocrisy among the large pharmaceutical companies , most of which have generic subsidiaries .
they want to hunt with the hounds and to run with the hare .
in the united states they see the generic medicine sector as an important job creator .
this report calls for the opening of that sector .
all of these would lead to a safer , healthier society with more sustainable medicinal practices and a pharmaceutical industry better geared to meet the challenges of the future .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , a large part of our european identity is based on our system of social protection and , in particular , our system of health insurance .
in this respect , mrs soltwedel has drawn up a very clear and detailed report which deserves our praise .
at the international level , the pharmaceutical sector is going through a period of upheaval , caught between the globalization of competition and cost-cutting measures applied to public health systems .
although europe has a large medicines market , it also fortunately has a great scientific and industrial tradition : something known as good manufacturing practice , a notion which must be preserved .
medicines are an essential factor in protecting health .
the availability , quality , effectiveness and safety of medicines must all be improved - on this point the report is categoric - in order to guarantee treatment or cure for everybody , and also prevention .
in this respect we must always remember the importance of information and the essential health safety on which insufficient stress is laid .
any fudging in this area is to be rejected .
we must impose strict regulations and not leave the market to impose its own rules .
in regard to reagents , which were recently the subject of a debate in this house , we must of course refer to the sad case of the ' abbot ' aids screening tests .
i repeat , it is essential to prevent any backsliding and to establish sufficient health safety not only between the member states but everywhere .
let us learn the necessary lessons from the situation caused by the bovine spongiform encephalopathy prion .
we must not limit the action of the public authorities in this field and confine the pharmaceutical sector to the area of industrial policy alone .
there is also the matter of health and people 's lives to be considered .
i repeat , that is what health safety is all about .
we must also endeavour to increase price transparency , although i know that the treaties do not , unfortunately , yet allow us to cause governments and laboratories to make an effort on this subject .
i am in favour of the use of generic medicines , but we must not dismantle the system of patents , without which there would be no research or investment , the costs of which are a growing burden .
as to gentle and homeopathic medicines , these attract me but also leave me sceptical .
finally , i welcome the creation of the european medicine evaluation agency .
i see this is an excellent first step towards community regulation .
i should like to end by looking at the need for bioethics and also add that i see europe 's increasing drug consumption as harmful .
there are countries which stuff themselves with tranquilizers , but i do not know of any pill against misfortune or unemployment .
it calls the attention of governments and of public opinion to the need to create a social climate conducive to therapeutic research .
we cannot support the report presented by the rapporteur .
the group of the european people 's party has therefore tabled a block of amendments which we think it is essential to approve .
it must not be forgotten that therapeutic progress would be best served by the promotion of innovation as would lightening the future burdens on social security systems .
the best protection of the interests of patients as consumers is the availability of high quality , safe and effective medicines .
we forget that a medicine is an active substance coupled with a process of pharmacological and clinical research , plus information and civil and criminal liability .
medicines known as ' generic ' , which make no contribution to therapeutic or social progress , contribute nothing to that .
it is only a factor of selfregulation and must be taken as such .
many of the speeches made by distinguished fellow-members on this report forget that there is very full legislation in the european union and that this communication deals only with the perspectives of an industrial pharmaceutical policy .
if we had concentrated on that , perhaps we should have achieved a better result and practically full support for the commission 's proposals .
madam president , i too am a small but active minority within the group of the european people 's party .
pharmaceutical research is both costly and time-consuming , and it can take up to ten or twelve years before a new medicine is ready to be put on the market .
in 1993 the average cost of research and development was estimated at ecu 275 million .
you can well imagine that sums like this can only be generated by companies with sufficient cashflow throughout the ten years which it takes to develop a new product .
and not only are the costs high , there is also a considerable element of risk involved .
all of this means that it is only the really big companies that can spare the money for research and development .
i obviously do not want american patent-holders to carry on benefiting once the patent has expired .
the patent period was the reward we offered the industry under the previous gatt system , in return for its investment in developing new products .
so we need to introduce an exemption in europe to allow research into generic medicines to start before the patents on them expire .
we need to allow products to be developed and marketed as soon as possible , so that production costs can be recouped as quickly as possible .
if the house does not support paragraph 17 , we shall simply be relegating our industry still further down the table .
madam president , this debate has shown that our communication was very necessary and , in my view , that we still need to discuss this issue further .
a number of questions have been raised here today which need to be examined in detail .
our communication clearly shows that this is not the case .
the community 's industrial policy in the pharmaceutical sector needs to take account of both the public health and social security aspects , without undermining the member states ' powers in this field .
maybe attacking the commission is just a good way of enlivening the debate , and it is something we are quite accustomed to .
what are the problems here ?
in the 1980s , employment in the sector could be expected to grow by more than 2 % a year on average .
as mrs peijs said , the situation with patents is also looking rather bleak , and this may also explain why employment has fallen .
between 1975 and 1979 , 61 % of all new pharmaceuticals were developed in europe , but the figure dropped to 48 % , in other words to less than half the total , between 1990 and 1994 .
over the same period , the united states ' share grew from 26 % to 31 % and japan 's from 11 % to 31 % .
if we include biotechnology , which is of course one of the major fields of innovation and will become particularly important over the next few years , the situation looks even grimmer .
patents at the clinical and pre-clinical development stage account for 58 % and 48 % of all patents held by american firms , in other words around half .
for european firms , however , the figures are only 26 % and 16 % .
what this means in policy terms is that we are dealing with an industry which is very competitive , even on the international market , but which is also in decline .
this is something the communication naturally also deals with - it is , after all , a communication on industrial policy .
but this is not a health report , and health is not one of my responsibilities .
what is more , the union is not responsible for all health policy matters , and this is a problem i shall come back to later .
the link here is obvious , because the pharmaceutical industry would not exist if it did not work in tandem with the healthcare and in particular the social security systems .
we would seem to be caught in a vicious circle , and it is up to us to find a way out .
the first thing we proposed was to establish a single market in this sector , an idea which has never actually been disputed .
pharmaceutical products should be subject to the rules of the single market , just as other products are .
this does not mean that they should always be treated like other products .
we have introduced a licensing procedure which has , in my opinion , come up to the mark so far , and we shall have to see how it progresses in future .
this was why we visited the agency .
i also have no objection to involving consumers and other organizations in assessing the results of this procedure and in evaluating medicines and the licences granted .
i have no objection to setting up an ethics committee , mrs soltwedel-sch&auml;fer .
but if you do , you will have to accept its findings , even if you do not agree with them .
this is not the case here , mr langen .
i am a very open person , as you know .
i am even prepared to be friendly , which shows you just how open i am .
what i cannot tolerate , however , is for people to demand an ethics committee and then refuse to accept its findings .
we have an ethics committee on food production and labelling , and i would remind you that it endorsed our views .
we did not ask it to do so , and there was no lobbying .
the members of the committee are completely independent , and they said the commission was right .
we have already dealt with the self-medication issues .
medicines are licensed as prescription drugs , pharmacy drugs or over-the-counter drugs , which means that the system is suitable for use throughout the union .
and - something which is particularly important with new drugs - we have already put in place some of the legal protection called for in this report .
the protection offered by patents can now be extended , in the sense that the unfortunate situation whereby the testing period had to be deducted from the length of the patent no longer exists .
this has already been dealt with , and we do not need to discuss it further .
the usa and japan have even followed our example .
so we are by no means starting from scratch , and what we have to do now is consider what to do next .
we are left with the four problems that mr langen mentioned , which summarize the situation very well .
first of all , which will be more useful : more competition or more regulation ?
i think a combination of the two would work best , both for the industry , for cutting costs , and for consumer supply .
some regulation will of course be required , and we have no desire to limit the powers of the public authorities here .
we need them to exercise their powers , as is entirely right and proper .
but this too is no guarantee .
take bse , for example .
it had nothing to do with competition or the commission , it was the public authorities who allowed it .
experience has shown that making a public authority responsible for something is unfortunately not always the best thing to do .
but this does not , of course , mean that we do not need public involvement in this particular field .
this is why i am convinced that experience is best of all .
you only have to look at the second question mr langen raised , about generic medicines and self-medication , which mrs read also mentioned .
what is the situation here ?
in countries which do not have competitive pricing , such as spain , mrs soltwedel-sch&auml;fer , where there are fixed minimum prices for medicines , there are practically no generics at all .
90 % of the market for generics is concentrated in four countries : germany , the united kingdom , the netherlands and denmark , because they allow price competition , and this gives generics a chance .
so anyone who wants to bring prices down for the consumer should not run away with the idea that fixed minimum prices are the way to do it .
the opposite is actually the case , since consumption tends to increase with fixed minimum prices .
in other words , mrs soltwedel-sch&auml;fer , total expenditure is greater with fixed minimum prices than if competition is allowed to set price levels and influence consumer behaviour accordingly .
these are basic market forces , but it is always difficult to have confidence in them , because they seem to be such an artificial mechanism which will inevitably produce bad results .
but this is not what happens .
mrs read is right .
look at how little of the total healthcare budget goes on medicines , for example : 14 % a few years ago , now down to 12 % , and even less in some member states .
hospitals account for the largest proportion , and even there the costs have fallen .
so when we are looking at ways of reducing costs , we should also think about how we can make this work better for us .
this brings me on to the question of how what we do affects the social security systems in the member states .
the council has not said a word on this , nor will it answer any questions about it , for one simple reason .
you are , of course , aware that any interference in these systems has enormous political implications , and we have absolutely no intention of harmonizing the member states ' healthcare systems .
what we actually want to do is to remove the price element from the social security system mechanisms and allow it to be determined by the market .
this will produce two results : low , competitive prices and at the same time proper social protection for patients .
if we succeed in doing this - and we have urged the member states to comply in a special protocol to this communication to the council - we shall already have achieved a great deal .
biotechnology is an extremely important issue here , and will come up again when we look at the patentability of technological discoveries .
i hope that we have now made some progress in this field and that parliament is able to accept the proposal , because there is a very real danger here .
it will not bring us extra jobs either , so what good is such a policy ?
as we can see , biotechnology is really a very important aspect .
finally , there is the question of generic and herbal medicines .
so do not shoot me , i ' m only the piano player , and i shoot back !
on the subject of generics and patent-protected medicines , here too the best idea is to allow both to exist alongside each other .
without innovations there would not be any generics , but at the same time generics play an important role in preventing innovations from becoming so prohibitively expensive that the health sector cannot afford them .
there is a symbiosis between the two : they live off each other .
i find it hard to welcome the idea that laboratory testing is to be allowed before the patent period has expired .
a patent covers only some of the costs that can be incurred in research today , which can run to enormous figures .
someone also pointed out how few medicines have been coming onto the market from research recently .
this is why we need innovations and why they need to be protected .
they can start to compete on price with generics later .
one final comment about mergers , which we also mention in the communication .
of course the competition rules must apply here .
the biggest pharmaceutical company 's share of the market is just under 10 % .
so even among the largest firms , the spread is so great that there will always be competition .
i hope that i have now answered all the points that were raised in the debate , though i am sure that we shall have a good deal more to say on this subject .
it is certainly a sector that is still worth fighting for , but subsidies are not the answer , nor are they what it wants itself , thank goodness .
but it is an industry that is losing its competitiveness , and this is what we must take action to prevent .
mr president , please let me put a supplementary question to mr bangemann , since he was given five times as much speaking time as i was .
before i come back to the pharmaceuticals report , i should just like to put the record straight about bse .
this does not concern you directly , mr bangemann , since it is not one of your responsibilities .
in october , when i went to see mr marchand at the commission to discuss european measures in connection with bse , much was already known which was not made public until six months later .
i am delighted to hear this , and i think it will help to provide much greater protection for patients and consumers .
i should like a straight yes or no on this .
i think you owe it to us to make a clear statement on this point , instead of just referring to what mr langen said .
my final question will probably also be very important for us .
what follow-up will be given to this communication on the pharmaceutical industry ?
can we expect directives or other more compulsory measures for the industry in the next six or twelve months , or will there only be the communication for the time being ?
there was no more to it than that .
i did not say anything about the bse problem as a whole .
of course we could talk about it for hours , but all i actually said was that the example of bse shows that this is not always the case .
i think we would get a good deal further if you did not always suspect me of saying one thing and meaning another .
i am very rarely devious , and i always warn you in advance , so that you know when it is coming .
i said this quite clearly and categorically the first time , and now i have said it again .
naturally a communication such as this is always the basis for further measures .
this will probably be the next item on our agenda , so we shall really want to clarify a few of the points we have mentioned before we produce any further proposals .
there is also the proposal concerning patentability , which i feel is quite important .
once we have dealt with this , we could discuss what else is necessary .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
prevention of drug dependence
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , for this second reading also we have taken into consideration a number of key factors . the first is that drug dependence is no longer a marginal issue .
drug-addicts are not therefore martians : they are , sadly , our children , those who live alongside us .
and if this is our approach to the problem , our starting point , then our response cannot be simple , simplistic , superficial or oversimplified .
what we actually need is to be tough in tackling the problem but also to be willing to talk .
if we are to respond , then we cannot set ourselves apart with our policy or scientific technique - we have to be able to communicate with those working in the field and seeking genuinely to combat drug dependence .
the work with which we , as a committee , tried humbly to make progress is at risk of being undermined .
i want to make that very clear - including to some members of my own group ; i am very much opposed to some of the amendments tabled by the european people 's party also .
but i most particularly disagree with those in the house who are deliberately trying to undermine a vital piece of work , obeying the diktat of certain governments .
i particularly condemn the superficial approach of those who operate on the basis of hearsay ; those who jump from one report to the next without considering the issues in depth .
we cannot tolerate that kind of destructive and superficial attitude to the tragedy of drug-addicts and their families , this social tragedy .
we need - and have proposed this - to make progress on the path to dialogue rejecting all radical approaches .
we have spoken of biological damage but also of the psycho-emotional influence of all drugs , be they soft or hard drugs .
we have described the sociological link between soft and hard drugs , but we also said ' no ' for ethical reasons because we are opposed to drugs sanctioned by the state .
but , just as firmly and energetically as we say ' no ' to liberalization and legalization , we are also opposed to the criminalization of drug addicts because prison neither saves nor rehabilitates them .
prison is a place of damnation : it is in prisons that , very often , drug dependence spreads further .
of course , if a drug addict becomes a pusher , then it is right and necessary that he should pay and answer before the law also .
but the amendment tabled by the committee on the environment , health and consumer protection sought , in cases of that nature too , to place the accent on rehabilitation and not punishment .
a specific commitment to establish certain priorities thus became apparent .
to conclude then , mr president , we say ' no ' to liberalization but , at the same time , no to the criminalization of young drug addicts .
i therefore ask you to reject some of the amendments tabled by the european people 's party , because , as i said at the outset , we cannot take a superficial approach .
we are engaged in a war in which we should all be fighting because we should all consider ourselves very much involved .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would strongly urge the members of this house to approve mr burtone 's report , and the commission and the council to give it their closest consideration .
mr burtone has succeeded in adopting a pragmatic and realistic approach which studiously avoids the usual platitudes .
however , in recent weeks a great deal of nonsense has been talked about the action plan , and in particular about the report itself .
so let us be quite clear about it : this report is not about legalizing or liberalizing any drug whatsoever .
this is a report on a public health issue and certainly does not come under the third pillar .
so let that be an end to all the nonsense .
secondly , at no point does this report approve the taking of drugs .
thirdly , the report stresses the importance of harm-reduction in prevention .
and what is today 's reality ?
what this means is that drugs are not only still available , they are becoming increasingly available .
mr president , i and my entire group are most grateful to mr burtone for his expert guidance in leading us through the first and second readings of this report .
the main focus is on prevention .
how can you stop young people turning to drugs ?
how can you help addicts to give them up ?
how can you limit the health risks ?
the funding available , hfl 12.5 million a year , is merely a drop in the ocean , and is only enough to pay for exchanges of experience , unfortunately .
use european funding for exchanges of experience by all means , but not for specific projects .
we have tabled a number of amendments on this point , and i think it is actually what mr de coene himself would like to see .
the policy of tolerance pursued in the netherlands is not the answer .
it simply makes drugs more easily available and acts as a magnet for addicts from other countries , increasing crime rather than reducing it .
making addiction a crime also does not work .
we wholeheartedly support the harm-reduction policy which the report recommends , and this means that we firmly believe that no distinction should be made between hard and soft drugs .
we have no sympathy , however , with the fatalistic approach adopted by mr de coene , who would have us believe that the fight against those who supply drugs is a lost cause .
tolerance and liberalization are not the answer , since they lead to a vicious circle in which society has to give more and more ground .
on television in the netherlands last sunday a leading socialist , mr tobback , said : ' what has our policy in the netherlands achieved ?
i am the mayor of a city with 35 000 students , and there has not been one single case of a drugs-related death . '
mr president , within every political group in the house there is a majority view and a minority view on the action programme on the prevention of drug dependence .
it is on behalf of the majority of the group of the european liberal , democratic and reformist party that i should like to congratulate mr burtone on his report .
a repressive approach is much more appropriate when applied to large-scale drugs trafficking and organized crime , but it will do nothing to help drug addicts .
it is also right to assume that a completely drugs-free society is nothing more than a pipe-dream , which is being just as realistic as acknowledging that we have a society which uses alcohol and tobacco .
as mr burtone said , we are not talking about life on mars here .
i think it is a pity that the report does not distinguish between hard and soft drugs .
in my country , the netherlands , drugs policy is based on this distinction and has produced very good results in the public health field , compared with other countries in europe .
i am pleased to see that there are a number of amendments which adopt this line in calling for disinfection sets and sterile syringes and needles to be provided in order to combat infectious diseases such as aids .
there are also some very welcome calls , such as in amendment no 23 , for substitute treatments such as methadone to be recognized .
mr president , i think the basic problem is summed up in a report by sir jack stewart-clark for the committee on civil liberties and internal affairs .
in that report it is stated that the g7 financial group considers that in europe and the united states 120 000 million dollars are in circulation bound up with the sale of drugs .
of that amount 85 000 million dollars are laundered in financial institutions .
i think that is the basic problem confronting all the institutions , including the european parliament , which try to deal with such a terrible problem as drug dependence .
we agree with mr burtone 's report and with the inclusion of the amendments at first reading .
those amendments also take into account the social situation of those excluded from society and the social situation of poverty which - not in all cases but in many - leads young people to drug dependence .
in my country 60 % of prisoners are behind bars because of drug dependence , and 40 % of that 60 % have the aids virus .
i know that we do not at present have a majority in parliament who share this view .
the same would apply to alcohol , if only we resolved to get to grips with the problem .
but i do not want to open up the debate on this issue , given the balance of opinion in the house .
one thing worries me : europe has seen a debate of incredible stupidity over recent months .
what are we heading for ?
this really is a bit much to take , ...
this is why our parliament must adopt the burtone report .
i do not agree with everything in it , but it is better than many other things .
mr chirac is a veritable danger to the public when it comes to public health and drugs .
but he will learn as he gets older , he will come to understand , as everybody does .
i therefore approve of the general inspiration behind the report and virtually all the amendments , with the exception of amendment no 8 which refuses to distinguish between hard and soft drugs at the prevention stage .
this is the edifying net result of the policy of repression .
but yet i do not propose to counter the dogma of unprincipled repression with a dogma of liberalization lacking in any public health objectives .
this is a simple , clear and understandable policy .
as long as we fail to courageously advance along this path , crime will continue to prosper from individual tragedies .
mr president , we have now almost finalized the drugs prevention programme .
the common position contains a considerable number of qualitative improvements introduced as a result of amendments proposed by parliament .
it will be easier to allocate funding now that specific projects are planned , which will help both the commission and the member states .
but this is playing into the hands of the drugs dealers , who are indirectly responsible for the destruction of their fellow men .
we reject on principle the acceptance of harm-reduction as a basic approach and addiction as a social phenomenon , since these undermine the very justification for providing assistance .
i therefore also oppose the amendments which aim to have harm-reduction adopted as a strategy .
persuading addicts to kick their drugs habit is a very delicate issue and cannot be governed by any general european strategy .
it is also a curative rather than a preventive measure , and this is not what this action programme is about .
to sum up , i support the common position , but i shall be voting against the burtone recommendation .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i should first like to protest against the propaganda on the subject of the burtone report , in the form of the tracts displayed in the corridors of parliament .
i therefore request , as far as possible and in parliament 's interest , the removal of these documents which are posted up all over the place .
now for the real subject of discussion .
repression is clearly in many cases the best form of prevention .
i also observe , as is almost implicit in the report , and extremely explicit in certain amendments - amendments nos 2 and 3 in particular - that a spirit of capitulation lies behind this combat against drugs .
this is totally unacceptable .
i am thinking in particular of amendment no 2 which says that a completely drug-free society is a utopian vision and amendment no 3 which says that the goal should be to limit the adverse effects of drug consumption .
and i did indeed say ' limit ' .
i should like to take an example in the field of economic sciences , namely inflation .
under the pretext that zero inflation is virtually inachievable in a period of economic growth , some economists have always believed that the official policy should be one of low inflation .
in a sense this is exactly what we are trying to do in the field of drugs by saying that , because we cannot totally eradicate them , we should make the official policy that of damage limitation .
as in the case of inflation , and for evident psychological reasons , i believe this to be a mistake .
today it has been made very clear to us that if we want to effectively combat inflation our goal must be zero inflation .
the situation is very similar when we come to drugs .
we must clearly affirm our commitment to combatting them .
another mistake is the way amendment no 4 , for example , suggests that drug addicts are simply people with a health problem .
this is not true : there is indeed a health problem , but also a moral problem and we should not forget this .
sophocles wrote , 2 , 400 years ago in antigone , that the man of knowledge knows how to freely choose between good and evil .
i do not in fact believe we will be helping drug addicts by presenting the whole problem as exclusively a health problem and exempting drug addicts from all responsibility .
on the contrary , i believe this would be presenting them with an additional obstacle when seeking to escape from drugs .
consequently , i believe it is a basic philosophical error to believe that you can dispense with repression in this area .
the human mind is not entirely rational , as we now know thanks to the work of phrenologists such as mac lean , and collective repression is absolutely essential .
it serves no purpose to spend large sums of money if you lack the moral courage .
drugs are spreading because this society is ethically decadent .
we are doomed to failure if we refuse to recognize the moral dimension and only consider the health and sociological aspects .
this is not helping the drug addicts , it is hypocritically allowing the traffickers to go about their business .
what do the traffickers want ?
they want the present situation to continue .
you have been very courageous mr burtone .
you have , through your group , encountered many obstacles .
i have been well aware that you had to steer a course between the two extremes .
it is essential to speak of risk prevention .
but it is not enough .
because here , which is the place to do so and where we can benefit from the experience of others , we must finally acknowledge that we are not making any progress and are in fact regressing .
the lisbon observatory provides us with the tragic figures .
of course there have been arrests and of course drugs have been seized , but drugs are continuing to enter europe in ever larger quantities every year .
the least we can say without making a moral judgment is that the repressive policy is not working .
but that does not mean i favour simply opening up the gates , quite the contrary .
however , i do not believe you are going to get very far by giving equally short shrift to those who want to liberalize and those who simply want to repress .
i greatly admire your courage and this report , but it is not enough .
let us be quite clear : there is racism in drugs .
when i hear of the tragic effects of soft drugs , i think of alcohol and tobacco .
for these are our drugs .
tobacco leads to a dependence estimated at 25 or 35 % .
and what do you do about that ?
but then it 's the state which sells it .
i am speaking from the public health point of view , if you like , but also from a moral and political point of view .
it is tobacco and alcohol which cause most damage in terms of public health .
let us remember this and not demonize other people 's drugs .
we too have our drugs .
what is needed is an economic approach .
we must have the courage to say that we must control , and not simply decriminalize drug use .
just as if you have drunk too much you are not allowed to drive , so if you smoke too much you will not be allowed to drive .
but when you consider that , in my country in particular , there are five million cannabis users , i wonder how we are going to manage to lock them all up .
here in parliament we have the obligation to discuss this matter a great deal more .
we clash with the experience of others rather than listening to it .
we should therefore discuss more among ourselves and benefit from national experiences , both negative and positive .
i believe that this will be progress and that this conference which you mention and which we all want to see , in 1996 , will be a step in the right direction .
finally , we must not demonize any experience or initiative , whether negative or positive .
mr president , drugs are a scourge which destroy our families and kill our young people .
for very many years already the european parliament has concentrated on three courses of action in combatting this tragedy .
firstly , preventing drug addiction , secondly , combatting drug trafficking and the related crime and , thirdly , helping drug addicts to get well again .
today we are interested in the first of these courses of action .
in my eyes this is the most important .
because if drugs lose their attraction for young people , if young people believe that all drugs and stimulants are a threat to the freedom of the individual , the drugs traffic will automatically decline .
finally , let us remember one important principle : programmes undertaken with young people are often far more effective than those undertaken for young people .
i believe that creating a sense of responsibility among those primarily concerned and ensuring their active participation must be a golden rule in preventing drug addiction .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i congratulate mr burtone for the efforts he has made , particularly of late , to tackle the problem with greater clarity but also greater realism .
that then is the reality .
we need then radically to change our approach and we must do this all together , to start with by discussing among ourselves the results so far of prohibition and criminalization .
that is why the most important amendment is amendment no 32 which calls for a conference to be held to discuss scientifically the disastrous results of prohibition and for the international conventions of the united nations to be revised .
mr president , mr burtone has done some wonderful work and he is obviously very concerned about drugs but at the same time i would like to say that i do not share all his views .
like most swedish politicians , my party in sweden , the centre party , can certainly not support the thesis that a drugs-free society is an unattainable utopia .
it is completely mistaken to regard a restrictive policy on all drugs as the antithesis of a policy to reduce suffering and the harmful effects of drug abuse .
however , the european parliament 's proposal will have no effect on swedish laws and regulations , dealing as it does with recommendations for a programme of measures .
unfortunately , however , this type of decision helps to undermine the legitimacy of the european parliament and the confidence of the people of europe in it .
this is an unfortunate consequence of today 's debate .
this debate has also strengthened still further my conviction that the area of criminal law should remain a purely national concern for the member states .
mr president , mr burtone 's report contains a number of different parts .
there are parts that i support , such as the importance that is attached to preventive work and the need for proper care and rehabilitation to help drug addicts give up their abuse .
there are also parts of the report , however , that are not at all acceptable .
it contains a number of more liberal formulations where the policy of what is called ' harm reduction ' is concerned .
this is a philosophy which is aimed at reducing the damage done by abuse , not at combating and putting an end to it .
the report also contains demands for a supranational drugs policy and for a review of existing international conventions .
this is not acceptable .
the un 's drugs conventions should rather be strictly applied by the eu countries as one element in the battle against drugs .
the policy of certain eu countries in the field of drugs today in practice serves to sabotage international cooperation in the fight against drugs .
in the report the issue of drugs is treated as a health issue and dependency as an illness .
drugs are , however , primarily a social and political issue .
the reasons for drug abuse are social conditions , exclusion , unemployment and the lack of future prospects for young people .
the battle against unemployment , social injustice and segregation is thus an important part of the battle against drug abuse - the most important part .
a proper policy for a system of care and rehabilitation which works is also needed .
in this context it is also impossible for society to accept either trafficking in or the possession of drugs - they should be illegal .
there should also be popular opposition to drugs and steadfast and consistent action on the part of the police and customs authorities .
this policy forms a single whole , all parts of which are needed .
mr president , as a socialist i regard the equal worth of all people as a central issue .
i cannot accept that people should be lost to drug abuse .
this is why i would like to see a consistent overall policy with a single goal : a drug-free society .
mr president , it is customary to congratulate a rapporteur .
this report goes against prevailing opinions and the blindness which make a situation which is in itself extremely worrying worse by the day .
so today we are concerned with the question of prevention .
this prevention must clearly be applied to hard drugs in particular , concentrating on intravenous drugs .
it must also be implemented at various levels : the family , schools , universities , associations , municipalities and workshops .
all of these elements must be appraised .
in this respect , holding a conference which would call into question the position of the international community would be very welcome .
mr president , this is one of the absolutely most important issues in europe and the international community as a whole .
it is a matter of how we can best and most effectively tackle the scourge of drugs .
this is a task which places us under an obligation and demands that we , as parliamentarians , accept our responsibilities and do not simply let things rest .
the view expressed by mr burtone 's report is a view which worries me .
it confirms that a re-evaluation is under way of the traditional policy on drugs which used to guide europe and which was the lodestar internationally in work on and the battle against drugs .
it smacks of resignation and lack of enthusiasm .
its message is that the battle against drugs cannot be won - but this is not true .
we know that a restrictive drugs policy combined with a well-developed rehabilitation system produces results .
we know that the fewer the young people who try drugs in the first place , the smaller the number who will become addicted .
this is why preventive work is aimed at young people .
it is by far the most important thing we can do .
it is the most important way of reducing the number of addicts in the future .
a policy which is geared only to reducing the damaging effects of drug abuse which is already taking place sends out completely the wrong signals and devotes resources to a completely wrong objective .
the policy of harm reduction is a policy of negative accommodation .
it is a defeatist policy .
if we are to be successful in combating drug abuse we cannot make distinctions between use and misuse .
nor can we make distinctions between soft and hard drugs .
there is always a risk - irrespective of what we choose to call it - an imminent risk that individuals will become addicted .
i cannot therefore support the burtone report and i hope that this house will be able to produce a more positive and more active policy on drugs .
commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to begin by thanking mr burtone for his report .
it is alarming to see the sharp rise in demand for synthetic drugs , particularly ecstasy , and the careless attitude that people take to these pep-pills , with no thought of the dangers involved .
hopefully , effective addiction prevention measures will succeed in reducing the demand , as they have done in the case of heroin .
i should also like to voice my opposition to any liberalization of drugs , in order to counter the expectation of rising demand .
europe is still seen as a lucrative market where there are profits to be made .
at the same time , any tendency towards liberalization and legalization has the effect of playing down the dangers of illegal drugs and is the greatest obstacle to prevention .
reference is always made in these debates to the consequences of alcohol and nicotine abuse .
not only should these problems be mentioned , but they should be seen as a clear warning , so that we do not end up with the same problems by making soft drugs freely available .
as a practising pharmacist , i oppose any attempt to make hashish or marijuana available from chemists , since that would mean putting drugs on a par with medicines .
instead , i would like to see new models and progress in the area of aid and therapy for drug users , including methadone substitution , though only in the context of therapeutic and psycho-social accompanying measures .
we need to offer improved and more specific counselling and treatment for those who are in danger from , or dependent on , drugs , and their families .
let us support the concept of living without drugs or addictive substances , and let us not trivialize these problems by engaging in a debate that blurs the issues .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am very pleased that the action programme on drug dependence is the subject of discussion in the house today .
90 % of the addicts being treated in my region are under 30 years of age .
we must turn off the tap and stop the continuous supply .
naturally , we must also improve and reinforce treatment programmes .
i welcome the proposals of the common position of the council which include a series of schemes which are clearly more important and more specific than those of the commission 's initial proposal .
efforts must continue in this direction .
in particular , we must increase the resources allocated to treatment cures .
we must also promote improved cooperation between member states and between the competent community bodies in this field .
and would it not also be wise to bring together all the community bodies and agencies active in this area within a single organization ?
it is only by such a pooling of energies that we will be able to effectively combat and eliminate this scourge .
mr president , it is most welcome that we now have our first preventative drugs programme based on health and social considerations .
i hope this is the beginning of better cooperation between the police and home affairs authorities on the one hand and the health and social authorities on the other .
there is a need for cooperation projects between the different authorities .
in finland we have had experience of these problems mainly owing to the import of drugs across our eastern border .
the starting point of drugs policy must be clear : society does not approve of drugs .
the non-medical use of drugs is unacceptable .
when a person learns to regulate his state of mind chemically starting with tobacco and alcohol and ending with drugs , a spiral of exclusion easily starts as a result of over-use .
' legal drugs ' ( tranquillizers ) finding their way on to an illegal market , especially when used in combination with alcohol , are a major and serious problem particularly for young people .
controls must be tightened .
drug education must be carried out skilfully and expertly without shock tactics and together with young people .
further research is also needed .
mr president , i strongly agree with the proposals contained in this report .
for too long in europe we have been concentrating on financial and trade issues at the expense of major social issues such as the drugs problem .
the imbalance has been somewhat redressed by the public health competence given to us by the maastricht treaty .
combined with unemployment and poverty , drugs are laying waste large parts of our cities and destroying the lives of our young people .
in my own city of dublin the number of heroin addicts has been increasing steadily for the last 20 years and is estimated to be about 7 , 000 now .
i would ask commissioner flynn to join with me in urging the irish government to coordinate its efforts with the efforts being made here in europe .
we need , for instance , to increase the size of the drugs squad .
the drugs squad in ireland stands at 1 % of the total force .
that is laughable when 80 % of dublin crime is drug related .
we must also ask for effective coordination between the g&aacute;rdai , the revenue commissioners and the department of social welfare .
it is time that the government came to grips with any remaining industrial relations problems in this area so that the ill-gotten gains of the drug dealers can be targeted .
i visited mountjoy prison recently in dublin .
it is clear to me that a policy of ' containment only ' operates there .
an effective follow-on therapy should be provided for prisoners by the eastern health board .
the ecstasy problem is now escalating out of control and party packs are now widely available in dublin .
we need more education programmes .
i ask the commission to bring forward further programmes along these lines to tackle this life-threatening problem that faces all of europe .
mr president , i have been working on the issue of drugs since the very first committee of inquiry in which i served with sir jack stewartclark .
i found myself pulled in a variety of ways over the years .
very often it is ageing liberals from the ' 60s , like myself , who advocate liberalization , legalization of drugs .
they make a very good case very often .
but generally speaking , the people who take this line are not themselves addicted , are not themselves very often in direct contact with the vast problems related to addiction , and they are complex problems .
of course the element of unemployment and poverty is very significant here .
we need to pay particular attention to our prisons .
contrary to what has been said by the previous speaker , i am happy to tell you that a specialized unit has been opened in the prisons in dublin .
i am sure many colleagues from other countries have experienced the same problem that very often young people in prison , who may not in fact be addicted when they go in , come out addicted .
therefore it is important that one has a unit in prisons where the prisoners themselves can make a choice against drugs .
you will find that a significant number of them will probably make that choice .
while 80 % of the people in our own prisons are there because of drug-connected crime , some of them are not .
this is a contagious disease , as contagious as tuberculosis was in the ' 40s and ' 50s .
we have to treat it like that .
we also have to recognize that our detox and treatment programmes must include not just detox but also an element of teaching life-skills .
you cannot rehabilitate people if many of them have never been habilitated in the first place .
mr president , i know that commissioner flynn shares with us the regret that we do not have total competence in all matters concerned with drugs .
the fact that law and order sits within the third pillar is regrettable .
therefore , this common position is a good first step .
mr burtone has made a sympathetic report and , on the whole , we ought to support this .
my view is that national countries must decide on their own drugs policy .
indeed , if we look at my own country , in scotland and england there are two separate drugs policies .
scotland is more concerned with harm reduction than england .
and here i see an absolutely vital role for the drugs monitoring centre .
that is its value .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the health of the people of the union is something we concern ourselves with as regards foodstuffs and consumer goods .
why should we then not concern ourselves with the health of our fellow citizens where drug abuse and its effects on the brain , lungs and reproductive organs is concerned ?
the policy on drugs must be approached from different angles .
there are no simple solutions .
the goal must be a society free of drugs .
we must find common and national methods which are effective .
the emphasis here must be on prevention and combating drug trafficking , while treatment detection and prosecution are national responsibilities .
if we wish to have the support of the people we cannot use eu resources to finance controversial projects , such as the prescription of heroin .
syringe programmes involving methadon are also controversial , however .
5 % of those who participated in methadon programmes over a period of ten years managed to overcome their addiction - this is not particularly effective .
we should , however , jointly evaluate our special national programmes .
this will also enable us to find a common policy , which will emerge from the results , results which will of course lead to lower demand .
the alternative to this policy is increasing drug abuse and gains for the drug traffickers .
what is important now is to show a willingness to compromise .
this we must do if we are to be able to achieve common measures .
i should also like to thank mr burtone for his commitment to this issue and say that i believe the commission and the council have chosen a realistic , sensible path , which parliament should support .
it is not the drug traffickers but our colleagues in the european institutions that we should support .
every time drugs are discussed in the european union , tempers flare - this time between france and the netherlands .
i am alarmed at how all the protagonists in the debate portray their own opinion as the only legitimate one .
this is an accusation often levelled at mr chirac , but in my experience it is at least as true of those , within and outside this house , who make a fetish of liberalization .
as far as the ppe group is concerned , the contradiction that is often drawn between help and punishment does not exist .
both are necessary if the problem is to be tackled truly effectively .
the swedish model seems to me the most successful one at present .
throughout the debate today , and indeed on other occasions , i have heard no convincing argument against the swedish model , and i see no reason why it should not be a model for europe as a whole .
in the light of that , i am also irritated by the debate between my country - germany - and the netherlands .
our foreign minister , mr kinkel , said recently in the hague that nobody wished to interfere in the drugs policy of the netherlands , but the german government as a whole takes a different view .
i wonder whether mr kinkel has forgotten that we are in the third year after maastricht .
the dialogue about combating drugs is not interference : it is european domestic policy .
to my mind , the third point is of particular importance .
mr president , i first of all thank all those who have contributed in such a sincere and dedicated way .
obviously it is a debate that touches a lot of people 's concerns in the house .
the text before you today for this second reading is the council 's common position on the first programme for community action to prevent drug dependence .
we all agree on the need for such a programme and the need to adopt concrete measures to combat drug abuse at european level .
as you know , the initial proposal has been extended following the incorporation of some 21 amendments which were proposed by parliament and which were supported by the commission either fully or partially .
the council took on board many of the amendments , sometimes , i have to say , in a different form .
i believe that considerable progress has been made in arriving at a text which is acceptable to all the community institutions .
i accept that there is need for some further work to be done so that we can resolve the differences that exist .
for its part the commission could not accept the council 's common position for two principal reasons .
they have both been referred to here .
the council wants to reduce the overall budget for the five-year programme from ecu 28.5m to ecu 27m .
the commission finds this unacceptable given that the common position which has been suggested by the council substantially extends the scope of the original proposal .
it wants to extend the scope and still reduce the money .
we find that unacceptable .
secondly , the management committee , a structure which is proposed by the council , is inappropriate for such a very small-sized programme .
the commission supports the setting up of a purely advisory committee , both as a matter of principle and in order to avoid unnecessary administrative burdens .
i remain of that view , notwithstanding the decisions taken on the committee structure for the three other health programmes recently approved under the codecision procedure .
i would like to turn to the commission 's position on the 32 amendments proposed by the rapporteur in the second reading .
twelve are acceptable to the commission , mr burtone , fully or in part .
these are nos 3 , 6 , 7 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 26 , 27 , 28 and 31 .
amendment no 4 : this statement is already covered by recital 1 of the common position and by amendment no 6 .
amendment no 5 : amendment no 7 describes the objectives of the programme in greater detail without reference to the objectives of a policy on drugs .
amendment no 6 : the first statement is fully acceptable since it confirms the public health approach to the scourge but the second part falls outside the community powers under article 129 .
amendment no 9 is already covered by amendment no 7 .
amendment no 13 : the content of this amendment is covered by amendment no 15 which is acceptable to the commission .
amendment no 18 : the tasks of the emcdda are dealt with in the regulation establishing it and it cannot be modified through this programme .
amendments nos 19 , 20 and 21 : i have already underlined the commission 's position concerning the nature of the committee foreseen by article 5 of the proposed decision .
furthermore , i would like to point out that amendments nos 19 and 21 are not in the line with the decisions taken by the three health programmes that were adopted at the beginning of this year .
amendments nos 22 and 37 : the activities foreseen in these amendments are not in line with the principle of subsidiarity and would exceed the budgetary possibilities of the programme .
amendment no 23 : the commission was supportive of the evaluation and exchange of experience in the fields mentioned in the amendment and this has been incorporated into the common position .
amendment no 24 : the commission considered that these activities are already included in the common position under generic provisions .
amendment no 29 : the prevention of drug dependence and associated risks with the support of the activities of relevant bodies is the main aim of the programme and it is already underlined in the council text .
so , having reviewed these various amendments , i would again like to express my appreciation for the work of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection .
i hope that the adoption of this programme will in due course support , relaunch and act as a catalyst for common efforts to prevent drug dependence and to help drug users .
mr president , i wish to speak briefly to express , certainly , my appreciation for the efforts made by the commissioner to align the commission position and that of the house .
but significant differences remain , both with the commission and with those who have tabled amendments on behalf , among others , of the epp , the effect of which is to distort the work done so far .
i repeat : we have taken a consistent line , a far from easy path ; at any rate , we have tried to respond to a tragic problem - the problem of drug dependence in europe .
those are the approaches we stressed in the difficult debate held in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection and , subsequently , in the house .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 12 noon .
votes
madam president , we would like a separate vote on amendments nos 5 and 6 .
madam president , i was under the impression that we had agreed that if we wanted a separate vote on anything , we had to say so in advance .
i naturally agree with mr pompidou , but i think we have to be consistent , otherwise we cannot carry on .
mrs oomen-ruijten , you are perfectly right in the case when there is a recommendation from the committee responsible .
that is why i initially stated that there had not been any recommendation from the committee responsible in the case of these amendments .
there is not therefore any problem .
excuse me for intervening once again , madam president , but we also want a separate vote on amendments nos 22 and 23 .
( the president declared the common position adopted as amended )
i should like a separate vote on amendment no 16 , madam president .
mrs oomen-ruijten , on this occasion the committee responsible has recommended a block vote on amendments nos 12 , 16 , 19 , 21 .
furthermore , your request for a separate vote does not seem to have reached us before the deadline laid down by rule 116 .
i am sure you will understand the difficult situation this puts me in .
we did everything according to the rules , madam president .
mrs oomen-ruijten , as you were able to appreciate this morning , we are introducing a system which is , let us say , rather more constraining and rigid than we are used to .
i believe we should be pragmatic and allow ourselves a certain flexibility in moving towards the strict application of this system , as we are not voting machines .
this is why i am going to allow a separate vote on amendment no 16 .
when you are president mr anastassopoulos , you will be perfectly free to be as inflexible as you like .
for the sake of fairness , madam president , if we have a sperate vote on amendment no 16 , we request the same for amendments nos 19 and 21 .
mr pompidou , you are seeking to shamelessly profit from the situation !
no , madam president , it is in the interests of consistency .
i am sure , mr pompidou , that you will withdraw this request which was made in order to inject a little humour into the vote .
no , madam president , my group is with me .
i cannot decide alone to withdraw this request .
( the president declared the common position adopted as amended )
madam president , i wanted to say a word on this point as i once again presented the table which failed by just one vote to win the commission 's support .
but i should like to draw attention to the fact that having approved the previous text we will be contradicting ourselves if we do not adopt the amendment which i propose .
yesterday commissioner papoutsis , who was here , demonstrated the coherence between the text we have just adopted and the table i propose .
this is why i invite you to vote in favour of my amendment , especially as the commission and parliament must succeed in convincing the council .
madam president , i should like to support the amendment .
i do not think there is any contradiction here .
the committee approved the table unanimously because , in the table , priorities are established very clearly , perhaps more clearly than in the broader brush-strokes of the text .
as i said , however , there is no contradiction here , and the committee approved this table unanimously .
thank you sir .
the house is sufficiently well-informed to vote in full knowledge of the facts .
after the adoption of the ' table ' part of amendment no 27 :
madam president , the table i referred to was , of course , that of the committee , not the table submitted by mr soulier and the ppe .
it is really quite straightforward , because the committee presented and approved this table , not the one that was submitted by the ppe .
i would therefore ask that the vote be retaken , because what i said clearly created some confusion .
so to recap and to make it quite clear : the committee 's table is not the same as that of the ppe .
mr lange , i believe that there is in effect some confusion .
i believe that for my part i have been very clear .
i put to the vote amendment no 27 by the european people 's party .
the rapporteur then requested to speak in order to explain why he was in favour of this amendment and why he had tabled it .
you spoke giving the impression that you supported it , but that is your affair .
this amendment was put to the vote once again and i made it quite clear which one we were dealing with .
we will not be taking this vote again .
that would not be right .
i believe that everything was very clear .
i should like to protest .
it is indeed normal for a rapporteur to speak on behalf of the committee .
but in this case we were misled for the simple reason that the rapporteur did not speak on behalf of his committee , but on behalf of his group .
that is not at all normal .
mr dankert , i listened carefully to the rapporteur , especially as he spoke in my language so there was no possible interpreting error .
i most definitely did not hear mr soulier refer to the ppe group .
i was really very attentive and i tell you this quite simply .
we will not be taking this vote again , it would not be right to do so .
everything was very clear .
i should simply like to say this , madam president .
on this basis , it was therefore preferable to support amendment no 27 by mr soulier rather than to maintain amendment no 26 by our committee on research , technological development and energy .
i assure members of my group that everything was conducted properly .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
there has been no movement on the thermie programme , a programme on renewable energy , which is being held up by the council .
it is therefore all the more important that we , as a parliament , get it implemented and make the council and the commission put their money where their mouth is .
otherwise , we in the eu will gradually become a laughing stock !
i would not go so far as to call us liars , but absolutely nothing is happening !
high-sounding words about the need for energy efficiency and co2 reduction are being bandied about , but nothing is being done !
it is all hot air .
otherwise , we shall make problems when it comes to the budget .
the proposal for a council decision concerns an exceptionally important area for the union 's member states in terms of the economy , the environment and supply policy : the promotion of energy efficiency .
it is vital , therefore , to extend the save programme for a new five-year period with a view to a more rational use of our scarce resources .
there is no point in not legislating in this area - on grounds of the principle of subsidiarity - in view of the cross-border nature of the problems associated with co2 .
recommendation for second reading by mr von wogau
we assume that the customs 2000 programme is concerned with agreeing at community level criteria for the minimum level of the controls to be carried out .
since the various member states today have different legislation governing such subjects as drugs and arms control we do not consider that it will be possible to arrive at a common interpretation of the powers of customs authorities .
in our opinion each member state should itself be allowed to decide on the level of controls to be carried out at its borders with other eu countries .
we are therefore very pleased today , at second reading , to see that the council has since taken the same line as ourselves and rejected parliament 's most contestable amendments .
as could have been expected , the european parliament has returned to the attack with amendments which my group voted against .
now , under the pretext of improving external controls , the proposal is to move towards ' communitization ' .
this is to make another mistake , and for three reasons .
i approve of parliament 's insistence in giving the community ' customs 2000 ' programme more force and substance faced with the hesitations of the co-legislator , the council .
the committee on economic and monetary affairs and industrial policy thus wants to step up the fight against fraud through harmonized and reinforced customs .
in the face of third parties , common tariffs must be matched with common customs .
this means imposing strict rules everywhere where there are customs , and not rules which vary from one member state to another .
such a programme can encourage the european union to advance in this direction , but we must of course show we are serious in implementing the programme , in particular when it comes to the controls .
each member state must provide its customs with the technical and human resources necessary to fulfill this task .
i stress in particular the importance of continuing high-level training supplementing the initial training which each customs officer receives in his country of origin .
this continuing training , to be given at a european customs academy , will be a vital asset for european customs officers working at external borders and involved in the fight against fraud .
we have voted today against almost all the amendments to the community action programme ' customs 2000 ' , since we believe that they do not respect the individual member states ' sovereignty .
it should still be up to each member state to decide how they wish to control their borders , train their personnel , etc .
practically all the member states have different laws on the importation of different kinds of goods , e.g. drugs and arms .
that is the way it should be in the future as well , and that is why we see no grounds for harmonizing legislation in this area .
the european parliament has now approved , at second reading , its definitive version of the ' customs 2000 ' action programme .
i hope that , as the next step , the council of ministers will signal its acceptance of the following important proposals from parliament :
drug abuse is one of the worst scourges with which europe has to contend .
it is therefore also extremely important that strategies for combating drugs are chosen with care .
we are of the opinion that the proposals put forward in the burtone report are geared too much to measures to reduce the harm caused by existing abuse .
we believe this is far too late .
greater emphasis ought to be placed on preventive work , particularly among young people .
we know that the fewer the young people who try drugs in the first place , the smaller the number who later become addicted .
we also believe that it is wrong to make a distinction between hard and soft drugs or between use and abuse .
the problem of where the line should be drawn will always arise and any ambiguity about what is acceptable and what is not will only send mixed signals to our children and young people .
a drugs policy aimed at restriction and prevention is the common path we ought to take , in order to be able to combat drugs effectively .
resignation and an ever increasing level of tolerance will only have the opposite effect .
the drug abuse issue is at heart a question of democracy and human rights : all men and women should have control over their own bodies .
a person dependent on drugs can never be free to exercise such control .
it is highly regrettable that the council does not have a point of view to match the scale of the problem of drug dependence and the essential need for prevention .
there must be no holds barred when it comes to combatting the drug dealers , those peddlers of death , and those who specialize in laundering drug money , the financiers behind organized death .
drug addicts must be saved from these people .
they must be cared for and allowed to benefit from the widest possible prevention , one which certainly includes a genuine european health programme but which also extends to other community policies .
the council must accept the cooperation which must be implemented .
the council must see drug addicts as people in distress who must be brought back into society and not as delinquents .
consequently ( and this is a long-term goal ) , we must first give drug addicts the means to avoid the spread of risks linked to drug consumption .
we cannot rescue them from their dependence overnight .
also , together with prevention pure and simple , which is a means of avoiding the use of drugs , we must protect addicts from the still greater risks they run .
i therefore fully support the burtone report , which we must adopt with a very large majority .
i hope that the commission will support our approach .
i invite the council to show greater realism and commitment in implementing this programme .
its very credibility is at stake .
what upsets me and greatly concerns many swedish people and other europeans is the tenor of the amendments tabled by mr burtone and the committee .
certainly it is important to help drug addicts .
it is at least equally important , however , to prevent young people and others being drawn into drug abuse .
clear signals are needed from the authorities of european states .
this is why i voted against central elements of the burtone report .
the fact that i have abstained from voting in favour of the report on the prevention of drugs , does not mean that i am not in favour of preventing the drug problem .
i am , to the greatest possible extent .
however it is precisely prevention of , as opposed to combating , this serious problem which is best undertaken at national state level .
the states themselves are best able to assess which policy and what resources in their particular circumstances - including cultural norms - will produce optimal results .
earlier , the burtone report caused considerable conflict between the majority , who are liberal on drugs , and most of the swedish members .
in the proposal which has now been adopted some of the proposals from those who are liberal on drugs have been removed .
it has also been established that it ' is not advisable to draw a sharp distinction between soft and hard drugs ' .
does this mean that the information provided by sweden has had an effect ?
this is possible and , if true , it is hopeful sign .
the report still contains a number of elements which the environmental party cannot support :
on the contrary , it is only if we tackle and reduce drugs dependence with enough political will and sufficient means that we will actually be able to attack this problem from every aspect .
the consumption of various kinds of drugs , including so-called hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine , has assumed dramatic proportions over the last 20 years .
it is not surprising therefore that many eu citizens today regard drug abuse as one of the greatest of all social problems .
nor can there be any doubt that this cross-border problem must , and will , be solved by means of a combination of national and international measures .
in this light there is every reason to welcome the commission 's proposal for a programme of action for the prevention of drug abuse .
i fully support these proposals to improve the community 's programme of action .
recommendation for second reading by mr castricum
the proposed interoperability of the transeuropean high-speed rail system is a good project .
but it only has any meaning if it is accompanied by a financial plan allowing europe to complete the efforts made by the individual member states .
we must apply the principle of subsidiarity and too often the european union intervenes illegitimately in matters which are normally within the sphere of competence of the member states .
but in this particular case it is surprising that the european union is not pledging major financial support for this ultimate transborder project .
let me take the example of the east high-speed rail link , running from paris to strasbourg , vienna and budapest . in addition to the efforts of the member states , this project also needs community funding .
the european union should redirect its efforts at genuine transborder projects .
taken overall , this would not increase expenditure but rather reduce it .
i should like to see a financial report one day complement the present report .
i believe there is an urgent need for this .
recommendation for second reading by mr cornelissen
i consequently welcome the work done in this report , to tighten up the regulations , and i am therefore able to support the report .
soulier report
total world consumption of energy is increasing , particularly in the developing countries .
unfortunately , this increase in consumption will primarily take the form of greater use of fossil fuels , increasing emissions of co2 into the atmosphere as a result .
in order to militate against this trend as much as possible , it is of paramount importance that the eu continues and intensifies its transfer of know-how in the energy sector to the developing countries .
as a step towards this end the eu should , for example , make all the useful data and experience gained from the eu save ii programme available to the developing countries .
soltwedel-sch&auml;fer report
madam president , the report by mrs soltwedel-sch&auml;fer is full of comments and proposals which show both good sense and goodwill .
however , certain points are unacceptable .
first of all , we completely rule out even a partial standardization of the social protection systems of the member states ( in order to harmonize the reimbursement amounts for medicines ) .
secondly , you must be careful when promoting so-called generic medicines .
thirdly , we are highly suspicious of the praise of self-medication .
this opens the door to all kinds of abuses and dangers .
we must never forget that medicines are an active product which must be treated with care .
we must therefore never lose sight of the all-important role of the pharmacist and physician in terms of information and control and not seek to sacrifice this at the altar of illfounded economic arguments .
the most important consideration in all of this must be public health .
despite these major reservations , we voted in favour of this report .
community guidelines for an industrial policy for the pharmaceutical industry must take account of the fact that the trade in medicines does not take place under normal market conditions .
it is not an invisible hand which determines demand , supply and price , it is the representatives of interest groups and government authorities which exercise a considerable influence over sales , consumption and profits .
this has a number of consequences .
' pharmacon ' means both medicine and poison , something healing and something deadly .
it goes without saying that you cannot obtain goods of this kind freely , nor can you supply them unsupervised .
we can also understand why the state , the health insurance funds , patients ' associations , doctors ' organizations , universities and the pharmaceutical sector are all involved in the creation and distribution of medicines .
the european union 's interest , and particularly that of the european parliament , lies in both the industrial and public health aspects .
as a member of the two committees asked for their opinion , i agree with the draft proposal in principle .
it is a sensible and balanced compromise between the different interests of the pharmaceutical industry , social security , research organizations , the health insurance funds , the medical profession and consumers ' organizations .
i do feel , however , that we need a clear definition of innovations .
a real innovation is a new medicine , not an existing medicine that is given a new description or a ' me too ' medicine which is brought out as a derivative years after a genuine innovation .
a real innovation is used to cure previously incurable or untreatable diseases and conditions , or offers better treatment for certain complaints or a better chance of curing them than existing medicines .
all in all , i feel that this proposal is a step in the right direction .
a policy on pharmaceuticals must take account of the competitiveness and profitability of the sector as a whole - industrial policy - and of employment , public health , medical progress and social security - social policy .
i believe that the proposal on which we are to vote meets all the requirements of sound policy , both industrial and social .
that concludes voting time .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
discharge for 1991 , 1992 , 1993 and 1994
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
mr president , i would not have objected to my danish colleague , eva kjer , speaking first .
what we are talking about here is 60 billion danish kroner .
this year the coal and steel union is the only body to have been awarded an unconditional statement of assurance , and that is incredibly good .
i would , however , like to start by congratulating the commission on the fact that the bagnoli case is now finally concluded .
for four years i have protested about a ten-year-old matter concerning the missing interest payments which the italians tried to cheat us out of .
the commission has succeeded in recovering this money .
it is a couple of million danish kroner , but it is something at least , as taxpayers will understand , that money which had been paid out unlawfully , has been repaid .
we should almost put the flags out to celebrate the fact that , on 11 october 1995 , the commission was finally able to resolve this matter .
but then we begin to have some of the minor points we have problems with . the solvency ratios .
we adopted a directive in 1992 , and now we are even contravening the actual solvency ratio directive .
that is to say that we have excessive external investments .
the key factor is risk spreading , and it is being confined to fewer and fewer debtors and bigger and bigger commitments .
i can quote a couple of figures . there are 11 debtors whose loans exceed 25 % of the ecsc 's net assets .
the main commitments exceed 800 % of net assets , which means that the risk is not sufficiently spread .
we may run the risk of some momentous events occurring whereby we suddenly sustain some losses , but perhaps we are running over into next year 's discharge procedure now .
but what if , for example , we are involved in a bankruptcy in connection with the tunnel between france and england ?
then the eu system loses - and wait for it everybody - over 10 billion danish kroner , and that is when things start to get problematic .
that is to say , therefore , that even if the accounts have been properly kept , there have still been shortcomings .
that is one of the things i am really aware of , and i have asked for a list of the types of guarantees we have .
i have been promised it by the commission , but have not yet received it .
we do not seem to be very good at speculating in securities either .
now we shall have to wait until the market changes and the rate goes up to recover the money .
let us look at another problem , for example the paris affair .
we have covered it up here in the accounts .
28 % of the investments which should have been paid back to the ecsc have not been received , and that amounts to ecu 1.68 million .
that means that the figures are being massaged , and i would therefore ask the commission to sort things out and stop using all these tricks to hide the figures .
i also wonder , in regard to all the properties we have at our 126 embassies around the world , whether the accounts have been tampered with there as well ?
these are some of the things which i , at any rate , will try to investigate when we get to next year 's discharge .
they have had god knows how many million kroner in interest allowances and , according to the commission 's legal service , we have no chance of recovering them .
in short , the commission should be brave and take a political step to get the money back .
finally , mr president , england has received over 50 % of the loans earmarked for four countries .
we cannot have that .
it is interesting when an english government does this .
prime minister major is behaving like a flirtatious woman ; asking all and giving nothing .
he may well like our money , but he does not like the eu .
i call upon mrs theato to speak on a point of order .
mr president , i did not quite understand why the order of the reports was changed .
i was told that the president-in-office would attend our debate and hear at least the first reports .
i would greatly appreciate your confirmation on this point .
my fear is that we will waste time by making further changes and failing to adhere to the agreed timetable .
the order was changed , mrs theato , solely because mr blak had important business preventing him from attending later .
all the other reports will be dealt with in the order envisaged .
the council will be able to speak , but it seems that there is some delay because of the trialogue which is taking place .
i call upon mr tomlinson for a point of order .
mr president , following on from the question that mrs theato has raised , the council itself fixed the time for the trialogue .
so it has deliberately double-booked itself .
to be in another room having the trialogue while the debate on discharge is taking place in this house is unacceptable conduct .
the council fixed the trialogue .
it determined when it was going to be .
it decided that in this debate , which rests on its recommendation , it can waltz in here whenever it wants and make its speech without having heard the debate .
i hope therefore , mr president , that you will consider denying the floor to the council when it arrives , because it has treated this house with disdain and contempt .
we should show it the same .
mr president , i am astonished that we are holding this debate on the discharge without having the commission here .
how can we expect people to take parliament seriously if it operates like this ?
i have been an elected representative for 25 years , but i have never experienced anything like this .
will you arrange for a representative of the commission to come here without delay ?
it is quite impossible to proceed with the discharge debate under these circumstances .
mr president , on the same point .
i was just going to make the move for adjournment and i am supported by a large number of members from all round the house .
mr president , i have just come from the trialogue and commissioner liikanen is indeed tied up there as is the president-in-office .
we left here when voting finished at 1 p.m. , went directly to the trialogue and for approximately 45 minutes the trialogue has been adjourned so that the presidency can sort itself out .
the way it has tried to conduct the meeting during the last two hours has been an absolute disgrace . i cannot see an end to it within the next two hours .
i do not know if the room is booked . i have come out because i have two reports on the agenda .
but you have a problem , mr president .
perhaps someone can get some information from the meeting room as to when they expect to be finished . that would help members considerably .
mr wynn , ladies and gentlemen , i shall suspend the sitting for ten minutes .
i have sent someone to ask whether after these ten minutes we can expect the council and the commission .
if the council and the commission say they cannot guarantee to be here in ten minutes , i shall put it to the vote whether or not we should continue with the debate .
( the sitting was suspended at 3.10 p.m. and resumed at 3.20 p.m. )
ladies and gentlemen , i have been in contact with the commission and the council .
the commissioner has been kind enough to come straight away .
as regards the council , we are told that they are discussing a document at the moment and will be another quarter of an hour .
i therefore put to the vote the question whether the debate should continue .
( parliament decided to continue with the debate )
mr president , i warn in advance that god help the council if it comes in here wanting to lecture us for half an hour on a debate it has not heard .
i hope you make that abundantly clear to the president-in-office before he walks into this room .
we were treated with disdain in committee when we were sent a civil servant to give what after all is a political recommendation .
we made it quite clear in committee that was unacceptable conduct by the presidency .
we have been treated with contempt again this afternoon and what we will not put up with is some sort of lecture on a debate which the council has not had the courtesy to listen to .
i hope the representative of the council can make that quite clear to the presidency before it comes to the chamber .
it will save some of us the embarrassment of having to say it again directly to the council when it arrives .
thank you , mr tomlinson .
the council has a distinguished representative here who will naturally report these points of view .
you know that it is not for me to censor what the council wishes to say in this assembly and you will receive the appropriate answers in parliamentary terms .
i therefore call upon the rapporteur , mrs kjer hansen , to present her report .
the agricultural policy has become so complex that it must be radically simplified and reformed before the accounts can be closed efficiently .
i hope that message will be an important consideration in any discussion of future agricultural policy .
it is also a problem that agricultural expenditure is paid via the eu budget only .
naturally , the member states do not , therefore , have the same interest in exposing irregular payments which may have taken place .
it is quite simply a clash of interests between the commission and the member states in that expenditure is not shared .
the procedure for closing the accounts is far from satisfactory for several reasons .
the commission does not have sufficient resources to carry out the procedure satisfactorily .
the scope of the audit is minimal compared with the transactions made .
there are areas where no checks have been made whatsoever for years .
it is also difficult to carry out proper checks owing to the large numbers of bodies involved in paying out funds in the member states .
in many cases it seems to be pure guesswork as to what sums are to be collected .
only 7 % of the corrections made in the 1991 budget are individual corrections .
the rest are ' standard ' corrections , i.e. the commission estimates or , more correctly , guesses what sums or what percentages are to be recovered .
the member states accept the corrections in the majority of cases , but we have also seen a number of examples of disagreements which have then been brought before the court .
i therefore welcome the fact that a conciliation board has been set up to enable the member states and the commission to enter into conciliation in the event of a dispute .
the critical problem with the procedure for closing the accounts is that what should have been a technical procedure has , in reality , become a political negotiation .
the assessment which the commission makes is made the subject of negotiation between the commission and the member state in question .
we have seen a number of examples of this .
of course , both good and bad things might be said about such negotiations , but the fact is that there is no question of objectivity .
another well-known example is the milk quota affair .
we have previously discussed this in great detail , but allow me to emphasize all the same that negotiation and political pressure predominated over the fact that there was a case of an unlawfully paid sum .
the whole matter ended up as political horsetrading , and the best that can be said about the milk quota affair is that the public got to hear all about it as it unfolded .
the fact that there is often negotiation between the commission and a member state means that the law is not necesseraly upheld .
the risk that the member states are not given the same treatment exists , whether it occurs consciously or is merely a reflection of accidental discrimination .
of course there are other member states which find this so-called flexibility quite acceptable , because they believe it could be in their interests .
the problem is , however , that the idea behind the closure of the accounts is to recover expenditure not actually entitled to support .
the system suffers from numerous failings and the most serious is that it does not ensure , and does not seek to ensure , objectivity in closing the accounts , so that the amounts recovered reflect actual losses .
i recommend that discharge be given for this area , not because it deserves to be , but because it is the natural thing to do if we are to be consistent and follow up an earlier decision .
mr president , the discharge for the 1992 budget has caused something of a stir .
could i ask the commissioner how much of the ecu 1.6 million has now been paid ?
a few points were left over at the end of the discharge debate last year , such as the inquiry into tobacco fraud in greece and italy .
am i right in thinking that very little work has been done on the investigation in greece ?
when will parliament be informed about the probable scale of the fraud and the measures that have been taken ?
does the commission share my view that this is hardly what one could call sound financial management ?
finally , there was the failure to recover ecu 170 m from spain for the nonapplication of milk quotas in 1989 .
this is an extremely serious matter .
it means that the commission makes the application of the treaty and the principle of equal treatment conditional on a protest from one or more of the member states .
i realize that most of these decisions were taken by the previous commission , but i insist on having a clear explanation from the present one .
the handling of the issue of funding for slaughtering calves in the netherlands is further undermining the credibility of the commission 's financial policy .
i know that the commission is to make a statement tomorrow , but perhaps the commissioner responsible for the budget and budget control could say something now about this ' spend , spend , spend ' approach .
let me explain what i mean .
i think this is an extremely serious matter which undermines the credibility of the entire commission .
can the commissioner explain how this is supposed to be consistent with the strict financial management which mr santer announced , and on which i congratulated him ?
after all , the proof of the pudding is in the eating , as they say , so i would like a detailed reply from the commission on this fundamental question .
mr president , these eight reports for joint debate represent something rather new in the community this year because the maastricht treaty instructs the court to produce a statement of assurance each year on the community 's finances .
it does not tell the court how to do it nor does it tell parliament what to do with it .
i was preparing to follow mr wynn with my remarks and now i find that i am playing st john before him !
the court devoted considerable resources to the das ( statement of assurance ) and that fact is obvious when you see the shortcomings or look for the holes in the annual report for 1994 .
i look to the new president of the court to bring about a restructuring of the working methods of the court .
i asked for that last year and i ask for it again because we need to see the court so organized that it can actually produce an annual report and the statement of assurance .
this leaves it , i know , hard pressed but if it acted more like an international firm of auditors and rather less like a pale copy of the european commission , it might be more successful .
the second problem follows the receipt of the das by the european parliament .
this has led to considerable discussion in the committee on budgetary control .
i strongly support the answers provided by mr wynn , which he will give later and which can be found in his explanatory statement .
he sets the das and the constitutional position of das in its proper context because all the european council did was just request that the court produce the statement .
it did not say how the court should do it and it did not say what we should do with it .
now my friend mr blak has had to depart .
it is a matter of breaking the windows and running away .
last year i said about him ' i regard him as the man in charge of the european coal and steel community .
he does a splendid job . '
however , with his remarks about the closure of coalmines , he has allowed his party politics to get the better of his normally sound judgment .
he is at it again this year !
it is true to say that he makes it clear the united kingdom has not acted illegally .
there has been no question of deliberate wastage of european coal and steel community funds .
while one of the mines was closed in 1990 , the markham main colliery has been mothballed , in that it is under repair and maintenance so that it can be used in the future .
we shall vote against his paragraph 11 .
if i may turn to dublin , that is a fairly easy task because the committee on budgetary control has no hesitation in recommending that discharge be given for the 1994 year .
i am delighted that it has been reported that the saga about property in dublin is at an end. this has gone on far too long and that worry is now behind us .
but the problem of financial control at dublin is not yet settled .
we recommended last year that the commission appoint a part-timer to carry out this work and this has not yet been done .
the pattern of work , the financial regulation and the court 's advice seem to conspire to produce too much cash in hand at any one time .
if the court , the commission and the foundation cannot get it right , they should propose an amendment to the financial regulation because the advice conflicts from year to year .
i hope that the house will endorse the committee on budgetary control 's recommendation that discharge for the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions in dublin be granted .
it is not such an easy story when we turn to the european centre for the development of vocational training , cedefop as we call it ; there are much more serious problems there .
i hasten to add that the problems are not mainly of the centre 's making - they are not its fault at all .
it must have been a prime instance of european cock-up theory which prompted the european council to transfer cedefop from berlin to thessaloniki .
i really believe that it was their intention to transfer the east european training foundation - who were temporary tenants of cedefop in berlin - to thessaloniki .
but as the king had spoken , the move had to take place .
the commission did not help because it indulged in some appalling labour relations so that more than half of the staff were not prepared to move .
i do not think parliament helped either because we had asked for independent consultants to come in and review the work of cedefop .
they chose to come in just at the time when morale was under the floorboards because the staff were not happy with the arrangements that were being made .
the court produced a fairly critical report on this point , but the consultants went so far as to suggest that the centre was not a great deal of use to the community .
i do not think the committee on budgetary control is the right body to make a qualitative assessment as to the centre 's usefulness and future use .
that is the work for the spending committee .
my view is that as long as there is a growing demand for the centre 's reports they must be doing some useful research which people want to get hold of .
that is a good commercial justification .
that work deserves an even higher priority .
rather than condemn cedefop out of hand by refusing discharge , we propose that discharge should be deferred .
the budgetary control committee recommends to the house that we defer discharge to cedefop for the time being .
i finish with an appeal to the commission and everybody else concerned to look at what is happening to the management boards for both dublin and thessaloniki .
there are now more people on the management boards than there are people working in the centre .
the founding fathers ' original idea was to get the social partners to talk together - that is a good thing - government , employers and trade unions .
but if you have one representative from each of the 15 member states and the efta countries and representatives from the commission , you have got boards of 60 people .
they meet twice and their bureau meets three or four times .
there must be a better way of doing it which would look more sensible to europe 's citizens .
i appeal to the commission to instigate an enquiry as to how this can be improved .
if that applies to the past , then we also welcome the sem 2000 proposals and hope that in the future things will be far better .
the problem when we give discharge is the fact that 80 % of the union 's budget is spent by the member states , and we all know this .
unfortunately , we do not give discharge to the member states , we only give discharge to the commission .
a lot of the specific subject areas within the report will be covered by people who follow me .
i just want to concentrate on one issue and one issue only , which has been referred to by mr kellett-bowman , and that is the das .
the das will enhance the sound financial management of the community 's budget - we all accept that - but there are problems , as the court of auditors indicated .
we asked it to specify individual cases and sub-totals based on substantial errors reported by the court ; then we asked it to inform parliament of the action taken in both cases .
so we await the commission 's response on that .
this was the first statement of assurance .
the results of the court of auditors ' report on the commission were somewhat mixed .
it was blazoned all over the media that the community was misspending or losing - of course , the word ' fraud ' cropped up time and time again - 4 % of our budget .
we have to take that on board and we have to decide whether we can give discharge to the commission in the light of what was said in the das statement .
let us just look at it .
the one thing that we have to remember is that discharge is the legal certification of the accounts .
when we look at this 4 % we have to ask the question : well , is this an acceptable level or a non-acceptable level ?
the simple answer is that it is a non-acceptable level !
parliament in no way can condone this 4 % figure .
so we cannot accept that one ecu in every 25 is wrongly paid .
but then you have to look at the system itself and you have to ask questions such as : is the figure reliable ?
that depends on which angle you look at it from !
you will find that discussed in the explanatory statement , where we ask whether the figure is reliable .
but if it is reliable , then whose fault is it ?
that is an even bigger dilemma .
in the main , we could blame the member states , because they are the ones who spend this 80 % of the budget .
but , of course , as i said , we do not give discharge to the member states .
the thing we should asking is : can those errors be corrected ?
let us be perfectly clear that parliament cannot legally establish a debt .
we cannot do the job of the commission .
therefore , we cannot make the recovery of the money a condition of discharge .
that is of fundamental importance .
parliament 's discharge power is focussed on the community 's accounts .
this is the area where , of course , we can act .
if the accounts were amended , as we request in paragraph 8 , to include the sums the commission hopes to recover , then three things would happen .
therefore , the conclusions reached in that general report are that we should grant discharge subject to these demands on the commission .
i now turn to the european development fund .
here the recommendation is greatly different .
there comes a time when we have to say enough is enough .
quite frankly , there are three things that have come to a head and which have now brought us to the stage where we say enough is enough .
we have said for a long time that the edf does not give the correct democratic accountability and that it is compromised by its legal and financial framework .
within this report and within the resolution parliament recognizes the commission 's attempt to improve the edf through its better financial management , even working within what we consider to be an impossible framework .
there is no criticism of the commission on the edf in general .
but the das gave us the opportunity to look at the accounts , and the court of auditors said that the accounts imperfectly reflect the financial situation and the operations of the edfs .
they lack the consistency and discipline to be able to reflect the true situation faithfully .
that is clearly not a positive statement of assurance .
dg viii of the commission would argue that it is .
that was once again our dilemma where we acted as the referee and in doing so the one thing we are clear about is that it is not a positive statement .
as i said about the general budget , it is there as a tool to help parliament .
it is member state expenditure which is managed by the commission .
in other words , the commission acts as a sub-contractor to manage these funds and to all intents and purposes parliament has no say in this expenditure .
yet we are obliged to give discharge .
we respect the court of justice ruling but it creates a confused and incoherent mess .
it also creates problems for the day-to-day management of the edfs .
if we want to give a discharge year in and year out , we would want to know where we stand legally to do so .
the commission has made great strides to change things and we accept that and welcome it .
that is the only way the system can change .
we also recognize with the current system that the commission staff in brussels is not sufficient , not in quality but in numbers .
it does not have enough staff to do what it should be doing at present .
the nature of the commission 's role as regards development funding gives rise to contradictions that parliament as a democratic institution finds extremely hard to accept .
member states take the credit for providing the funds .
they write the rule book - such as it is - but they then leave the commission and parliament to take the blame .
so there are two aspects which i have named so far .
firstly. the das and , secondly , the court of justice ruling .
the third aspect was what happened at the cultural foundation .
there should be no excuses whatsoever from the commission .
when i met the commission it would have been nice for them to have said : ' it 's a fair cop , guv ' nor .
we hold our hands up , we were wrong ' .
but a defence was put up in certain quarters and i find that quite inexplicable .
when something is as bad as what happened with the cultural foundation , we should not try to cover it up .
the commission took a political decision which it did not have to do even if the council of ministers was leaning upon it to do so .
in no way , shape or form should parliament be connected with that decision .
if we had not had the das or the court of justice ruling , i for one would have been recommending that we do not give discharge because of what happened with the cultural foundation .
from now on we have to look at it through different eyes and for the year 1994 the recommendation is refusal of discharge .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as a parliament we have a different task from that of the court of auditors .
our task is to make a political assessment of what the budget reveals about policy .
in the area of social policy , it reveals a gulf between the requirements , in terms of european social policy , and the european social policy that exists .
that comes across very clearly .
it is then further reflected in individual structural problems .
if we grant a discharge , we must recognize , on the one hand , that although european social policy is needed , it is not being practised .
however , we must also ask ourselves - and i would explicitly endorse what mr wynn said on this point - who is responsible in each instance .
if we cannot manage to curb this behaviour on the part of the member states , there is something strange about criticizing the commission and refusing to grant it discharge .
we must , therefore , grant discharge to the commission , because we have succeeded in establishing to our satisfaction that it is not the commission that is at fault here .
mr president , it is our job to monitor the efficiency of development aid and to exercise control , in our own political interest and the interest of the taxpayer .
it is perhaps worth noting that all this aid would not be needed if we had a fair system of trade , and were prepared to cancel debts .
in many cases , there are no written reports on these matters .
the commission should not rely too heavily on the implementing authorities or firms to provide effective monitoring .
this problem with the cultural foundation is a scandal , but it is already two years old .
we in parliament have brought the scandal to light , and set the wheels in motion to have it discussed .
i think we can fairly say that it is being dealt with .
if we do not grant this discharge , we may spark off a fresh debate about lom&eacute; iv and financing .
we have just been involved in major controversy with the council about these issues .
i find a great deal to criticize in lom&eacute; iv too , but we are talking here about the only forum for north-south dialogue .
this political dialogue has to be important to us .
therefore , we should not see it destroyed because of this one instance .
it is important that this issue should be discussed at the intergovernmental conference .
we must make the inclusion of the development fund in the budget a political issue at the conference .
that is our demand .
we should use this budget discharge as an occasion to exert pressure on the national governments .
mr wolf has just said that we must place a share of the responsibility on the national governments .
that is what we must do .
it is my belief that if we proceed by making an example of this scandal , the effect we produce will be disproportionate to our analysis .
that means that the fund must be budgetized .
it might then be possible to resolve scandals and problems such as these by other means .
mr president , i would like , first of all , to congratulate all the rapporteurs on these many reports and say that in each case i will be following the rapporteur 's recommendation .
it reflects the work they have done to get consensus for their reports .
i want to use my limited time to talk politically about the process that we are going through .
the commission 's attitude is welcome .
quite clearly the culture in the commission has changed and is improving .
i hope it will continue to improve until we have the sort of culture that has been visualized both by the president of the commission and in the sound and efficient management documents that have been put before us .
when i turn to the council i have to say that its attitude in the process is deplorable .
80 % of the expenditure is spent in the member states .
the fiddles that affect the european taxpayer largely take place in the member states and under their jurisdiction .
the clearance of accounts is in the member states .
the fines are then against the member states .
i could just as easily cite the other member states ; i am only choosing italy because i know it will be close to the president-in-office of the council .
other member states such as spain , greece , ireland and the united kingdom , have all been fined in the clearance of accounts procedures .
yet this council , which is long on rhetoric when it comes to value for money and the fight against fraud , is short on action .
the action of the council has been to send a civil servant to the committee who could not answer a single political question and to absent itself from our debate today .
granted it is absent to be at a trialogue , but they were the people who double-booked the meeting !
it is a contempt of parliament .
we might just as well have had a debate with an empty chair .
that has been the level of the contribution that the council has made to our procedures .
mr president , first of all i should like to associate myself with what mr tomlinson has just said .
however , we can already see growing signs that the court lacks the material resources to achieve the objectives which parliament itself has laid down .
and the requirement under the maastricht treaty to prepare a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts will contribute still more to putting pressure on certain material resources which are already very tight .
however , i think that the majority of this assembly would not approve such an application of the principle of subsidiarity .
but it is clear that more effective machinery for cooperation between the court of auditors and national audit departments must be set up .
all that comes from different constitutional systems which make it very difficult - though not impossible - to establish indispensable machinery for collaboration to ensure that community resources are satisfactorily controlled .
the commitment and political will of the members of this assembly to strengthen the material capacity of the court of auditors to perform its duties must be very clear .
i should like to end by congratulating all the rapporteurs whose capacity and readiness for discussion are shown by the small number of amendments tabled .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the debate on the discharge for 1994 is proving of to be of greater importance than in the past .
in particular , we must ensure that there is greater transparency and publicity , particularly as regards the administration of direct funding , in certain vital sectors such as tourism and , more generally , internal policies .
we shall have , if necessary , to look into the possibility of setting up a committee of inquiry into the protection of the community 's financial interests .
mr president , i would like to start off by commending mr wynn for his discharge report on the general budget .
i believe that the rapporteur has succeeded in putting his finger right on the sensitive points which need to be highlighted .
i agree that a change has taken place recently .
co-operation with the commission is now conducted in a more positive spirit than hitherto .
i believe , however , that it is depressing to note that there are so many repetitions in the discharge reports , year after year .
we must impose a requirement that if the regulations are not observed , aid will be reduced , so that there are also consequences in this area for failure to comply with the applicable rules .
it is imperative that the purpose of the aid which we provide through the phare programme is to pave the way for enlargement with the eastern and central european countries .
however , the very fact of discussing these deficiencies openly and frankly can go some way towards generating confidence .
nothing should be swept under the carpet .
in this respect , all the reports paint a very clear picture and have the support of my group .
as i see it , there are two main areas of difficulty .
we must cut the ground from under the opportunists .
what do i meant by that ?
my colleague mr samland , and of course the council , will have more to say on this point .
if the rules on the administration of the structural funds are not observed , and if this does not incur , for example , the suspension of further payments , then such an approach is actually being encouraged .
it is a fact that 80 % of the eu budget is spent by the member states , and it is precisely there that significant deficiencies are emerging .
however , we shall get nowhere simply by issuing appeals .
as long as the eu budget functions with the present high level of subsidies from the agricultural and structural funds , there must be a range of sanctions mechanisms to prevent irregularities going unpunished .
the commission should therefore take very seriously all the proposals made by the committee on budgetary control for securing and recovering sums wrongly disbursed .
as regards external policy , the important thing is to overcome difficulties in the treaties , in order to achieve a more transparent spending policy and genuine cooperation between the two arms of the budgetary authority .
that applies equally to the european development fund and to the common foreign and security policy .
parliament has repeatedly called for the edf to be integrated into the budget .
the reasons for taking such a step are obvious , and led the court of auditors to comment that it was hard to draw any comparison between what was intended and what was implemented .
i would therefore say to all those who argue that a refusal to grant discharge would be an insult to development policy in general and our commitments under the lom&eacute; convention in particular : it is quite the opposite !
the financial subculture that we are currently sustaining is creating major administrative weaknesses .
we are meant to grant discharge , even though we have no influence or effective political control over how the resources are spent .
that has to change , not least in order to improve the quality of our development policy !
refusing discharge will , therefore , send the right signal to the intergovernmental conference , to tell them that it is time they came up with an institutional solution to this dilemma .
i also expect the conference on the revision of the treaty to produce clarification of the common foreign and security policy and associated budgetary matters .
there is a major procedural loophole , and unfortunately it now also affects discharge , because at the end of the day , parliament cannot discharge the council .
with regard to mrs kjer hansen , it was very clear that where there are corrections to be made , this should not be a political , negotiable matter .
it should be an objective matter based on the actual loss .
i follow mr cornelissen 's report on this point .
he explained that the money was not recovered because no member state had applied to the court .
this really will not do .
we have to get a new and better system that will work because they will find it inexplicable otherwise .
there is room for improvement .
to come to mr wynn 's general discharge , he says that he is recommending a discharge on assurances by the commission .
it is a bit difficult to know how we will vote because the commission has not been here to hear him and to give these assurances .
so what are they worth ?
we will not know , unless it reads the transcript tonight .
the council is here now but it did not hear either .
it is a very unsatisfactory situation .
i will have to explain that to my group at tonight 's meeting .
i am very critical of the member states .
they are dealing here with the european taxpayers ' money .
they do not seem to take it seriously enough .
we should not be giving the fig leaf of respectability that was mentioned by getting involved in a procedure where we really cannot act properly because we do not have proper control .
if i could have that assurance i could advise my group .
if it does not make any financial difference , if it does not destroy their confidence , then i could go along with the refusal to discharge .
but i would quite like to hear about that .
mr president , representative of the council , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to begin with a comment on procedure .
i should like to point out that we are discussing eight reports in under three hours .
one of these concerns action to be taken following the 1992 discharge , namely mr cornelissen 's report .
on this subject , you will remember the discussions on the discharge in question , which was postponed for more than a year .
the second of these reports concerns action to be taken following the 1993 discharge .
is this reasonable ?
should not more time have been allowed for each of these reports ?
but do you know what this foundation 's budget is ?
i say this for the benefit of those who listen to us here : ecu 810 , 000 or 0.04 % of the edf .
i tabled an amendment which simply specified these amounts .
without being contested , this amendment was rejected .
why ?
in truth it was because the decision on discharge had been made in advance .
the arguments put forward are no more than pretexts .
discharge to the commission was refused because the edf is not integrated into the community budget .
so i should like to ask a few questions .
why was discharge granted at the time of previous edf budgets when similar criticisms had been raised and the legal framework was the same ?
have we taken into account the disastrous consequences , in political terms , of this refusal to grant discharge on the conference of acp countries , in terms of the way they perceive the commitment of the european countries ?
before requesting additional competences for parliament , would it not be better to ensure that there are more deputies able to implement them ?
mr president-inoffice , commissioner , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am very sorry that i am only now able to take part in this debate .
as you know , i do not make a habit of being late , because part of debating is , of course , being able to respond to what one 's colleagues have said .
i am exceptionally sorry about this , and it certainly does not mean that we underestimated the importance of this debate , but it does explain why we could not be here on time .
it has to be said , mrs m&uuml;ller , that there are certain points where one has the feeling that it should have been possible , somewhere between 1991 and 1996 , to achieve some movement .
a look at the tobacco regulation or the regulations in the wine sector , however , forces one to the conclusion that even five years is not long enough to see progress .
let me say something more on these four points , and firstly on tobacco .
we have a report before us from the court of auditors on this issue .
we asked the commission to submit a report on it , a report which was to be based on the court of auditors ' guidelines and submitted by 1 april .
the same applies to the wine sector , which is a virtual disaster .
we insisted that a register should be compiled - properly compiled in every member state .
now a new register is to be set up because the first procedure posed too many problems .
however , we are still paying for the current procedure and , of course , the new procedure is not available yet .
whose fault is it that the reform proposals have not been properly implemented ?
as in the previous case i referred to , the culprit is the council .
furthermore , the council has some 256 decisions pending , whereas here in parliament we have only 52 decisions in the pipeline .
that shows where the bottleneck and the imbalance between the institutions is to be found .
the third point concerns interest for the structural funds .
last but not least , transfers of appropriations by dg xix .
the committee on budgetary control has unanimously approved my draft report on this issue .
i am here to present the council recommendation , adopted on 11 march and transmitted to the house , that the commission be granted discharge for the budget for the 1994 financial year .
i am sure that you share the view of the presidency and the council that the two institutions need to work in harmony , including when it comes to measures concerning the community budget .
firstly : the decisions should reflect the needs of communities ; secondly : the resources should be used economically and efficiently ; and , thirdly , there should be complete transparency in resource management and accounting .
those criteria assume crucial importance at the current time when the member states are having to contend with well-known social and financial problems .
in its recommendation , the council emphasizes that budgetary discipline and respect for the principles of sound management , to which i referred , have to be applied to all measures funded from community resources .
it is vital that there should be a period review of the reasons that led to the adoption of the measures under way in order to guarantee economy and efficiency in resource utilization .
that should always be done independently of the assessments made to prepare budgetary decisions .
the reports of the court of auditors and the monitoring activities on which they are based provide the basic instruments that permit us to monitor the application of those principles .
we have to congratulate the court of auditors for the efficient way in which it performs this task assigned to it by the treaties .
in the field of own resources , the council shares the concerns of the court of auditors about the operation of the community transit scheme in the member states .
in that connection , it is most certainly interested in the european parliament 's suggestion that a temporary committee of inquiry be set up to look into these customs arrangements .
moving on to the structural funds , the council notes the persisting and major problem of an excessive concentration of commitments and payments towards the end of the financial year .
the council considers it necessary to improve cooperation between the competent national authorities and the commission services involved in spending activities .
we need also to make a greater effort to clarify the criteria governing the admissibility of expenditure and the verification of declarations of expenditure .
the council has pointed out that the accounts accurately reflect the revenue and expenditure of the union , even though the information they contain needs to be improved .
that has been at the root of the council 's concern , and it has welcomed the announcement of the programme to improve the commission 's financial management .
that programme must be applied rapidly and in full to reduce errors in payment transactions .
that is what the presidency had to say , on behalf of the council , on the problems relating to the 1994 budget .
mr president , i may have misheard what was said .
the council referred to the european regional development fund , but it did not take a position on the european development fund .
mr wynn warned that the discharge would be suspended .
the house would appreciate a response to what we have advocated , so that then we know where we stand .
we also have to form an opinion on these matters within our group .
the council cannot simply sweep its problems under the carpet now , because the scandal has made them quite apparent .
i should like a response from the council on this question .
does the council wish to speak again or wait until a later occasion ?
i prefer to wait , mr president .
mr president , as spokesperson for the socialist group on development , i deplore the fact that the management of the european development fund is not democratically accountable .
i deplore the fact that we go through this annual pretence , this annual charade , when parliament has no say whatsoever over the funding of the edf .
i deplore the disgrace of the management of the cultural foundation .
it was a scandal which was investigated by the bureau of the joint assembly of the lom&eacute; convention of which i was a member .
we called witnesses and carpeted individuals , including a key member of the european parliament .
i make that specific point to be fair to the commission .
cultural cooperation is central to development and has suffered a big setback because of this scandal .
i trust that the refusal to grant discharge will speed up the move towards the democratic accountability of the edf .
i wish to put on record that this parliament formally deplores the disgusting scandal of the cultural foundation .
i express the view that the commission should be vigilant and meticulous in supporting these views , about which i believe both the commission and parliament are in full agreement .
will the council now please as a matter of urgency exercise its responsibility to ensure that the funds of the edf are properly accountable .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , eight discharge reports have been presented , not quite in the order indicated on the agenda , but we appreciate the reasons for that .
it is impossible to speak on them all in four minutes .
i wish to look at only a few key points , but i should like to extend my sincere thanks to all the rapporteurs .
i shall begin with a word about the authority to grant discharge itself , and about our committee on budgetary control .
for 20 years now , we have had the authority to grant discharge , and we have constantly been developing it .
he performed his task well in so far as he could .
now you , mr president-in-office , have addressed the house , and i think you have also listened carefully to what has been said here .
our comments have been directed mainly at the member states , but it is not the member states to whom we must grant discharge .
i should like to turn now to the issues involved .
this time , the discharge of the commission involves two instruments which have been used for the first time - instruments , as i said , directed specifically at the member states .
the first innovation is our vote on the clearance of accounts for the eaggf , submitted by the commission for 1991 .
clearance of accounts was previously classed as a technical procedure for which the commission was responsible .
parliament had little to do with it .
it is thanks to mr cornelissen , as rapporteur on the 1992 discharge , that the problems from previous years have been raised .
a particular problem which has been brought out into the open is the loss to the community of some ecu 1.6 billion on milk quotas in three member states .
detailed discussions between the committee on budgetary control and the commission have produced reform as regards the clearance of accounts decision , which now completes the discharge already granted for the year in question .
this procedure is being applied for the first time for the year 1991 , with the very good report by mrs kjer hansen .
the rapporteur deserves our thanks for highlighting the difference between the technical and political aspects .
the necessary financial corrections applied by the commission to the member states are absolutely non-negotiable where losses to eu funds are involved .
if this is not the case , then the discharge for the clearance of accounts will have to be suspended until the monies are recovered .
an initial tangible result of parliament 's insistence on protecting taxpayers ' money is that the first tranche of the unpaid milk quotas has been received .
the second innovation , the statement of assurance , or das , by the court of auditors , has far-reaching implications as regards discharge .
the rapporteur , mr wynn , has done this in the motion for a resolution from the committee on budgetary control , and his readable explanatory statement provides us all with an invaluable aid to understanding this complex issue .
i would like to thank him particularly for that .
my group therefore backs the recommendation to grant discharge to the commission in respect of the general budget for 1994 , in spite of the shortcomings that have been identified , and subject to the appropriate conditions .
madam president , it is appropriate that in discussing budgetary matters we make some reference to the key principles governing responsible budgetary control , such as prudence and the allocation of funding to appropriate and deserving projects .
however , it is clear that not all european projects adhere to these principles and i wish to refer to one in particular .
i am speaking about the administration of our own finances within our own structures .
recent visitors to brussels were taken aback by the continuing construction of the european parliament 's new headquarters there , which has been going on since 1990 , and the ornate nature of the building in question .
this latter-day glass tower of babel is utterly unnecessary and a waste of resources which parliament could have more constructively utilized for other aspects of its work .
all these ecu saved are now being heedlessly squandered .
meps , who have a democratic mandate from the electorate , were not consulted on the building of this folly or allowed any opportunity to veto its construction .
instead , the building of this glass palace has continued unimpeded .
it is particularly ironic that we are discussing budgetary and fiscal matters today in this parliament .
if ever there was an example of budgetary irresponsibility , it is the grandiose edifice currently taking shape in brussels .
perception is very important in this european parliament and this is no help to it .
madam president , i have a number of comments on the wynn report on the discharge for the 1994 financial year .
first of all , what he says about agriculture .
i think that in future it will be almost impossible to forecast agricultural expenditure with any accuracy .
so i think it is always better to err on the side of caution , so that we are always able to honour the guarantees we give our farmers .
one aspect over which we do have control is to make the rules as clear as possible , but as many people have already pointed out , they still leave a lot to be desired .
if a political decision is to be taken on how the rules are to be revised , i think it should be a matter for the commission , the council and parliament together .
my second comment concerns the phare programme .
could we not bring officials from the agriculture ministries in the countries of the former eastern bloc over to brussels , and send dg vi people to those countries to explain its policy ?
it is doing practically nothing to implement directives on public contracts or the environment .
the reason for this is clear : if it did so , the structural funds would end up being even more seriously underspent than at present .
i find it hard to believe that the 50 % profit all goes to the contractors .
the situation with the environment is no better .
the main reason for this , as i have said before , is that most of the commissioners regard it as far more important to spend the budget than to respect legislation .
i entirely agree with what mr liikanen said in a letter concerning community customs , that the commission has no choice but to carry on enforcing existing legislation .
that is just as it should be .
but in my experience , it is not what the commission actually does .
madam president , my colleague from my constituency , mr killilea , was at his colourful best when he described the new european parliament as the tower of babel .
i am sure it is designed to attract the maximum attention , but i do not want that sort of allegation circulating in my constituency unanswered .
we did not build a parliament for the members of parliament who are here today .
we built it for the people of europe .
it was built at a cost of about ecu 3 per capita for one year of the people of this european union .
i am proud of that building .
it reflects some of the technology and the grandeur of the age and the competence of the people of europe of this day .
the attack by mr killilea was not worthy of a member of parliament .
if he had attended regularly to the business of this house he would have known that we were consulted .
if he was not prepared to be here at all times then he could trust his colleagues who were here and made the decisions .
i want to thank mr wynn for his report .
i support his refusal of discharge .
i am not looking at it in the area of the european development fund .
i do not agree with the tone of his criticism in relation to agricultural spending .
the expertise and the knowledge that i find in the commission surprises me at times .
it is a most infinitely complicated business to try to forecast what the cost of agriculture will be for any year .
parliament is continuously a little bit harsh insofar as this sort of criticism is concerned .
the last point i want to make is in relation to the fine that was imposed on the irish government .
unfortunately the irish taxpayers have to accept this while they got no benefit out of malpractices which led to it .
i want to underline the fact that it was not at european level but within the irish parliament that the first disclosures and demand for clarification on all these abuses occurred .
this fine was exceptionally harsh in that it was equivalent to ecu 1 , 000 million for the british or the italians .
irish agriculture got no benefit out of it whatever .
madam president , i will refer to the report by our esteemed colleague mr edward kellett-bowman on postponement of the discharge to the management board of the european centre for the development of vocational training in thessaloniki .
frankly , i did not understand why mr kellett-bowman is asking for postponement .
is he doing so because there was a financial scandal in the management up till 1994 ?
if so , he should say so in his report , he should describe it to us , and i believe we would then all go along with him .
however , his report mentions no such thing .
on the contrary , it expresses doubts about the continuation of that centre 's operation - cedefop 's operation - related to its productivity and efficacy .
those who had powerful political protectors were transferred to other services of the european union .
those who were close to pensionable age requested early retirement , which they were granted , and finally , those who did not fit either of these categories resigned .
so of approximately 100 people , less than half are now in thessaloniki .
and i , ladies and gentlemen , would like to ask : is that how europe 's enlargement will take place ?
when the eastern countries accede in due course , will certain spoiled members of staff refuse to transfer to capitals outside the parisberlin-brussels triangle ?
is that the basis for the european parliament 's policies on decentralization and regional development ?
i am very sorry , but unless i get serious answers to the questions i have raised , my recommendation to my group will be to vote against mr kellettbowman 's report .
madam president , i wish to speak with reference to mr blak 's report on the ecsc on the discharge for 1994 .
i would like to draw members ' attention to paragraph 11 in mr blak 's report that is on the uk pit closures .
can we look very briefly at the wording of mr blak 's report ?
it says , very interestingly , it accepts that the ecsc will not be able to recover by legal means the interest rate subsidies paid to financial production enhancing investment .
but if it cannot be returned by legal means , is mr blak , or is the commission , going to send the boys round to 10 downing street to ask for the money back ?
what is at stake here ?
the court of auditors ' report says quite clearly that under article 54 , 15 pits received subsidies .
two of them were closed .
one - lea hall in my constituency - has received an unrecoverable subsidy of almost half-a-million ecu and frickley colliery a subsidy of ecu 294 million , which has not been recovered from the british government .
monies have also been paid to pits which were subsequently privatized - two , again , in my constituency : trentham and silverdale .
i know that when trentham was privatized , much of the equipment paid for by the ecsc was actually bricked-up .
how are you going to get that money back for us and stop it happening again ?
the question of the staffing of uclaf is similarly important .
this means that it must also be given the level of staffing that it requires .
this has demonstrated the importance of checks and the need to extend their scope significantly , so that the member states , too , can be made aware of their own responsibility .
the final issue that i wish to highlight concerns the satellite bodies , the decentralized institutions which are based in individual member states , but work for the union as a whole .
our greek colleague has referred to the centre for the development of vocational training .
as a result of its move to thessaloniki , this centre is experiencing difficulties .
mr kellett-bowman and the committee were right to recommend that we should defer discharge until this body acquires a clear function and provides a quality of service commensurate with the need .
we shall see whether this is to be the case .
if so , the centre will have a purpose .
if not , we must draw the necessary conclusions .
madam president , the debate on discharge for the european budget clearly throws up one important reason for the disenchantment with europe that we see in our countries .
one of the causes of disenchantment is the somewhat lax approach to money - european taxpayers ' money .
i have been following the debate today with interest , because it has focused quite clearly on the question of finding a culprit : was it the member states , or was it the commission ?
i see this as a rather fruitless line of inquiry .
the european parliament is being shuttled here from pillar to post .
i cannot entirely absolve the commission from blame .
through its refusal , parliament will let it be known that we are no longer prepared to cover for goings-on which deserve to be highlighted , rather than concealed .
it is clear that irregularities , such as that involving the cultural foundation , occur in areas where the responsibilities are ill defined .
to put it plainly , it is our wish and our demand that the european development fund should become part of the european budget , so as to remove the grounds for mismanagement in this area .
i hope that the new member states , too , will have some pertinent suggestions .
however , i think that we are also entitled to expect active support from the commission .
i think this is extremely questionable .
indeed , it has to be asked whether the commission takes the whole business seriously enough , and i would simply remind you of how the debate opened .
i was not made sufficiently aware today of the way in which the council and the member states are involved in this whole process .
i also think that in many cases , the commission 's attitude to member states which step out of line , by failing to observe the conditions , is half-hearted .
in any event , i have no hesitation at all in supporting the proposal to defer or even refuse discharge in the case of cedefop , but this situation cannot go on indefinitely .
i already see reason enough to ask whether we should not be thinking in terms of closure .
contrary to the view of one of the previous speakers , mr kellett-bowman made it very clear that there is no assurance at all that this centre is performing its functions efficiently .
in conclusion , i should simply like to make a point which i think has been neglected this year - that just as we have been looking at expenditure , we must also consider revenue .
we referred to the fact that this task is being undertaken in the committee of inquiry .
however , the committee reflects only some of the major concerns in this area which we need to discuss .
madam president , at the outset , i must state that i have particular reservations about mr kellett-bowman 's report on cedefop .
the report refers to minor financial management problems , which lead it to conclude that cedefop 's discharge concerning the financial year 1994 must be postponed .
the proposal to postpone discharge is based on a report by external consultants , which is unclear about the extent to which it refers to the financial year 1994 .
i suspect that other aims and aspirations lie behind this attitude , such as restricting cedefop 's activities and closing it down , as the report indirectly implies .
yet , it was a policy decision that we all ought to respect and support .
the utility of cedefop is enormous at a time when unemployment is one of the european economy 's gravest problems .
madam president , i think the european commission has an obligation to make better use of cedefop 's contribution , as the rapporteur himself also said .
besides , a long-term programme prepared by cedefop has already been prepared , and this must be given serious attention .
finally , i would like to invite the rapporteur , when he visits thessaloniki , to assess the situation objectively .
for the present , i call on the rapporteur to delete paragraph 2 of the motion for a resolution , which casts doubt upon cedefop 's utility .
it must be said that this is only the tip of the iceberg .
i believe that it is the role of this commission and of this council to monitor and control the use of those funds and to take action .
i am afraid it is simply not good enough to say that , for legal reasons , the commission cannot act to recover taxpayers ' money .
it simply will not wash with the public and they will see the hypocrisy of our policies .
therefore , i ask the commission and the council to take action .
two years ago i tabled parliamentary questions on this matter .
as yet we have had no results on that .
madam president , i wish to refer to mr samland 's report , on which i congratulate him .
i welcome in particular his reference to the tacis programme and the greater need for commitment to the monitoring of tacis projects .
there is also a need , as the rapporteur stated , for a better dissemination of the results of the tacis programme .
tacis has poured some &pound; 600 million into the russian federation , for example , in the last five years .
yet does parliament have a clear idea of where the money has been spent or how effective tacis has been ?
the answer must be a resounding no !
increased accountability and transparency must be given top priority , including increased monitoring of programme spending for the newly-independent states of the former soviet union .
but this must not be at the expense of swift and efficient implementation .
i should like to apologise for the delay at the beginning but we were spending time together with members of the committee on budgets and presidency trying to solve the problems of next year 's budgetary procedure .
the debate today and the vote tomorrow bring to a close the review of the financial activities of the community in 1994 .
the process of external control is a key part of the efforts to improve the effectiveness and the value for money of the community budgets .
each step - from the reports of the court of auditors to the thorough deliberations of the european parliament - reinforces the efforts for financial management reform in the commission and across the community .
the committee on budgetary control , based on a report by mr wynn , recommends giving discharge to the commission with regard to the general community budget for 1994 .
discharge is also proposed concerning the european coal and steel community and the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions in dublin , based on the reports of mr blak and mr kellett-bowman , respectively .
the commission welcomes these proposals .
in this context i want to reply to mr blak on the question of bagnoli , italy .
the subsidy was fully paid back by the end of the last year .
the discharge for the cedefop is postponed .
the commission will work with the rapporteur , mr kellett-bowman , to clarify the outstanding issues .
finally , with regard to the european development fund , based on a report by mr wynn , it is proposed to reject the discharge .
i will return to this question in a moment .
the particularity of the 1994 discharge procedure is that it has to evaluate the results of a new instrument introduced by the maastricht treaty , the ' statement of assurance ( das ) ' .
at the same time , the necessity to come to general conclusions on the basis of a small sample poses difficult methodological questions .
there is also the difficulty of explaining the meaning of the results to a broader public .
as has already been said today , the headlines of : ' billion ecu fraud and waste ' - unfounded as they were - show the difficulty of a broader public to comprehend this instrument .
it is therefore particularly valuable that the comprehensive and balanced assessment of the first das by mr wynn will establish a reference for future exercises .
i want to congratulate the commission and mr wynn for their excellent work .
i especially want to refer to the explanatory note because it is conceptually a very difficult issue and it is very clearly explained in the note .
this might even prove to be a useful reference for the commission in the future .
the commission will continue to work with the court of auditors and outside experts to improve the methodology of das .
the main consequences to be drawn from the first das are twofold .
firstly , all efforts will continue to eliminate sources of errors identified in das .
the errors attributed to the commission - mainly formal - have been addressed as part of the first two stages of the sound and efficient management programme ( sem 2000 ) .
the errors attributed to the member states - often substantial - will be addressed in the third stage of the exercise .
this stage has been launched .
the first meeting of the group of personal representatives of the ministers of finance of 7 march 1996 was fruitful .
a work programme was agreed .
it covers topics from the preparation of the budget to financial control .
the first items discussed in some depth included the question of eligibility of structural funds expenditure and the possibility of reinforced sanctions .
these questions are identified by the 1994 discharge report as the key question for the structural funds .
as mr samland said in his report , this is a key issue .
we hope that in the working group we are going to find a solution .
the discussions in the group of personal representatives confirmed expectations that progress on the questions will be difficult .
a number of member states took a view opposite to the approach of the court of auditors and the european parliament .
there is , in fact , a built-in contradiction between , on the one hand , ambitious quality objectives and , on the other hand , the political commitment to ' spend it all ' by 1999 .
the european council of madrid has given a strong impetus to increasing quality of spending and examining the possibility of new sanctions .
but the basic contradiction remains .
the commission will therefore - from now on - provide a report on the follow-up of each serious payment error .
this report will be made available jointly with the annual financial accounts .
furthermore , the claims forecasts ( or pr&eacute;visions de cr&eacute;ances ) will from now on be established by sector .
the amounts will be estimated by the commission services concerned regardless of the source of information which establishes an irregularity .
the recovery will then be pursued according to the sectional procedures in place .
in different sectors we have different procedures .
as far as internal policies are concerned , the 1994 discharge report expresses serious doubts on the transparency of procedures with regard to direct financing and subsidies .
there is little evidence to support this view in the report of the court of auditors .
in fact , it should be noted that both life and research expenditure have their specific , detailed rules assuring transparency with regard to project selection and programme evaluation .
publication in the official journal is mandatory .
tourism activities have been thoroughly evaluated .
the results will be transmitted to parliament in a few weeks ' time .
i highly recommend reading this report as an informative approach to the evaluation methodology in which i strongly believe for the future .
the commission will work with parliament on any useful improvement .
instead of another horizontal report covering all of category 3 , it would however be more effective to focus on individual programmes through ex ante and ex post evaluations for each programme concerned .
let me turn then to the european development fund .
the committee on budgetary control proposes not to discharge the commission .
this proposal is not primarily based on bad management by the commission .
in fact mr wynn 's report recognizes the commission 's attempts to improve edf financial management although it criticizes the financial management of the acp cultural foundation .
instead the main reason is the non-budgetization of the edf .
the commission regrets this proposal .
for its part it will continue its best efforts to improve the administration of the edf .
the management mistakes made with regard to the cultural foundation are recognized but consequences have been drawn from this experience and the foundation has been shut down .
it should also be borne in mind that the amounts involved were quite small .
furthermore , the commission has always shared the criticism of parliament concerning the legal and financial framework of the edf .
the commission will continue to press for budgetization of the edf .
but to refuse discharge until the edf is budgetized , while being understandable and consistent , may mean that until such a time parliament 's voice will not exist with regard to the edf implementation .
finally , as you are certainly aware , there are those in the commission dealing with development policy who fear that the refusal of discharge may make development policy more difficult in future .
let me conclude with two replies to mrs kjer hansen and mr cornelissen , whom i also want to thank for their excellent reports .
mrs kjer hansen talked about the resources in the clearance of accounts .
we have known the needs there , but i want to say that the commission has already taken a decision for the 1997 budget that we will not ask new resources outside the enlargement budget .
so we will do all we can within the redeployment and the enlargement budgets .
mr cornelissen had a number of questions here .
first of all , concerning the recovery of the funds for exceeding the milk quotas , we are recovering the funds in four years which means in four equal tranches .
in 1995 we have already received ecu 450m ; ecu 450m has been decided for this year and budgetized and two other tranches will be recovered in 1997 and 1998 .
as far as tobacco fraud is concerned , investigations and legal proceedings continue .
the commission will keep parliament informed of any new developments .
as to the buy-back scheme of milk quotas , the legal base has in the meantime been adopted and the commission considers this matter closed .
on the spanish milk quota in 1989 the commission does not have a legal base to change the decision .
this is also the position of the court of justice .
finally , on the dutch calves i will transmit that question to commissioner fischler .
my expertise is not sufficient for that .
there was also a question on the ecsc loans to british coal .
we discussed this matter also a year ago .
i am sorry to say this but , according to the opinion of the legal service , there is no legal base for the commission to recover these subsidies on the grounds that british coal was subsequently closed .
finally , i want to extend thanks to mrs theato , the chairman of the committee on budgetary control for these exceptionally thorough and productive discharge procedures for 1994 .
mr president-in-office of the council , would you like to speak ?
madam president , a very brief comment concerning the european development fund .
i would point out that the fund is financed via direct contributions from the member states and not with appropriations from the community budget .
that being so , discharge of the fund budget was not mentioned in today 's speech by the presidency .
madam president , we must correct that statement if it is going to be in the record .
what came through in english was that parliament plays no part in discharge of the edf .
that is the whole point .
we play a part in that and in nothing else .
madam president , there is a very serious conflict here between the commission and council that we need to clarify .
the commission has alleged that unless we grant the discharge concerning the european development funds , it may make their work more difficult .
this was followed by a statement from the council informing us that we do not have any responsibility whatsoever to discharge the edf .
could they get their act together and tell us what the situation is ?
madam president , i am grateful to the council for the information it has just given us , but i would appreciate it if the accuracy of that information could be checked again .
as far as i am aware , it is not accurate .
there is definitely a recommendation from the council as regards the development fund .
i would therefore ask for this point to be checked again .
madam president , on this point i fully support what mrs theato has just said .
i should simply like to make the point , at the end of this debate , that there has been frequent mention of the respective presence of the institutions during the procedure .
commissioner liikanen was present to reply to the rapporteurs but four of the eight rapporteurs were absent .
we will take note of this .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 12 noon on wednesday .
question time ( commission )
the next item is question time to the commission ( b4-0431 / 96 ) .
the removal of controls on goods and baggage at internal frontiers does not flow from the schengen agreement .
further reductions in and the final abolition of such checks will depend on the gradual increase of travellers ' exemptions and on future developments in the rules applicable to travellers crossing borders ' .
it is , in particular , the community instruments , adopted to complete the internal market , that guarantee the removal of controls on goods and baggage at internal frontiers .
i posed this question because the opponents of cooperation under schengen always maintain that accession to schengen will make it more difficult to catch criminal gangs .
as the honourable member is aware , the commission is taking part in the meetings of the schengen executive committee as an observer .
the application of the schengen agreement has therefore stimulated cooperation in the field of activities of prevention and control applied by the competent authorities of the various member states .
i therefore believe that the response - of particular interest to those countries which are considering acceding to schengen in the future - may be encouraging .
mr president , i should like to take up the issue raised by mr haarder 's question .
at present the situation is that these controls are conducted on the basis of spot checks without the national customs authorities in denmark and sweden having to have any suspicions of criminal behaviour .
does the commissioner consider that such spot checks , not based on any suspicion of criminal behaviour , are compatible with the schengen agreement ?
it is sufficient that are not carried out automatically because the frontier is being crossed .
controls are in any case possible far from frontier zones and , on occasion , even at the frontier , but they have to be based on the assumption that the frontier has been crossed .
mr president , this surprises me a little as we have been told that it will no longer be allowed for sweden to carry out spot checks of the kind carried out before we acceded to the european union .
this question is therefore extremely important .
some change is surely bound to happen in connection with the schengen agreement ?
however , given that the crossing of internal frontiers can no longer form the basis for carrying out checks , the exercise of that power must form part of a system of controls covering the territory as a whole .
any power to carry out checks that is able to exercised solely where or because an internal frontier has been crossed would therefore be incompatible with article 7a .
as the author is not present , question no 19 lapses .
i apologize to commissioner flynn and to mr mcmahon who rushed to the chamber for this question .
question no 20 by brian crowley ( h-0240 / 96 )
subject : duty-free shopping
duty-free shopping at airports , on airlines and on car ferries is a voluntary activity on the part of travellers , the profits from which contribute significantly towards the viability of many airports , air and ferry routes .
in addition , the products sold in duty-free outlets throughout the world are dominated by brand names from european union companies whose competitiveness is assisted by duty-free sales during international travel within the european union .
that is the thirteenth recital of directive 91 / 680 .
the commission wishes to make it quite clear that in considering the issue of duty-free sales it has to be borne in mind that refraining from collecting taxes in specific sectors is in fact tantamount to granting aid .
it will therefore be difficult for the commission to consider extending the facilities for duty-free shops , as these are arrangements incompatible with the principles of the internal market .
i thank the commissioner for his response .
however , he is somewhat misguided in what he has said .
indeed he is throwing a very unusual veil of secrecy over what is going on .
he said that the duty-free mechanism is contrary to the internal market .
yet one of the major points of any internal market should be the harmonization of vat and excise duty ratings .
that is not happening .
there is no sign of it happening in the near future .
i will try to be brief although the matter is not particularly simple .
duty and tax-free sales to intra-community travellers at airports , on aircraft or on ferries have been authorized by the council until 30 june 1999 .
it should therefore no longer suffer distortions of competition from tax-free sales after the 30 june 1999 deadline , which is the end of the period of adaptation .
so the relevant event which logically produces the necessity for an end to the dutyfree system is not the future definitive vat regime but is something which has already been substantially in place since 1 january 1993 .
i should like to thank the commissioner for the observations he has made .
my own view is that it is a complex matter , as he has said .
it is probably too complex to deal with in this manner .
the commissioner has suggested that duty-free shopping , were it to continue beyond the deadline set by the council , would offend the principles of the internal market ; but it does not necessarily offend against the treaty .
the treaty provides in article 99 for harmonization necessary to ensure the establishment and functioning of the market .
i do not know that the case has yet been well established that the scale of alleged distortion is in some way a significant problem or impediment to the functioning of the internal market .
i should like to ask the commissioner one question .
on 20 november 1990 in a debate on the vat system in relation to the fuchs report your predecessor promised the house a full commission study on the implications of abolishing duty-free sales prior to the date in question .
this question gives me the opportunity to refer to the report .
that is the way it is in many places in europe .
a different transport pattern is produced when duty free sales are done away with in this manner .
finally , i have a question which does not need to be answered , because i realise that it is complex .
we might well ask what duty free sales actually mean : do they distort competition when all the member states take part ?
strictly speaking , they do not .
the last thing which i should perhaps mention is , that as this report is delayed in the commission , it indicates that the actual complexity of the matter just cannot be described in a report .
there are transport , social and regional conditions to be considered .
i hope , however , that we will be able to find a solution together .
the point about transparency is a relevant one .
it is true that the present duty-free system contributes to the financial resources of airports , ferries and so on .
that is what i have said from the beginning in saying that the present duty-free system contains an element of aid .
question no 21 by wayne david ( h-0229 / 96 )
subject : vat claims
what are the procedures involved in claiming back vat on goods and services purchased across the european continent by long-distance lorry drivers ?
the applicant has the right to use the pre-stamped form in any of the official languages of the european union , whereas the form itself must be completed in the language of the country making the refund .
although the commission is aware of the practical problems that these procedures may create for operators , it is not , unfortunately , possible to remedy them in the context of the current vat arrangements .
problems of that nature will , however , come to an end when we move on to the definitive vat regime , based on the principle of taxation in the country of origin .
in fact , the place of taxation will at the same time determine the place at which the tax is deducted .
the commission has indeed considered whether , under the present regime , there is any way of eliminating the inconvenience which i acknowledged is there .
i am afraid we have not been able so far to identify any such possibility .
international removal companies are experiencing very similar problems with vat to those of lorry drivers .
can you confirm which country should levy vat on removals - the country being moved out of or the country being moved into - and can some clear guidance be given to the companies concerned ?
question no 22 by per gahrton ( h-0256 / 96 )
subject : europol
commissioner gradin previously stressed that europol was to take the form of cooperation between police authorities , not between police forces . she rejected the notion of an ' eu fbi ' .
cooperation already takes place among police authorities in interpol .
will the commissioner specify what she personally believes europol can and should do that interpol or its european division is not already dealing with or could deal with ?
under the treaty on european union police cooperation is an issue of common interest .
this is perfectly obvious from both title vi of the treaty and the declaration on police cooperation .
some of this cooperation will be achieved through the development of a union-wide system for information exchange within a european police office , known as europol .
the aim of europol is to improve the opportunities for the competent authorities in the member states to fight serious forms of international organised crime within the european union .
in accordance with the convention there will be close cooperation with interpol .
the council will establish provisions formalising this cooperation and ensure that the various functions complement one another .
thank you for that answer but i do not believe it was a proper answer to my question as to what europol will do that interpol is not already doing .
swedish police chiefs have also expressed public criticism , including the former national head of police , who is also a former president of interpol , who asked more or less the same question .
i would therefore repeat the question : what is europol expected to do in practical terms which interpol does not already do or could do ?
if no answer is forthcoming to this question it is clearly an organisation set up to compete with interpol , in which case one might well ask whether it is necessary at all .
i do not see europol as an institution which will dissipate energies - on the contrary .
europol is needed so that information can be analysed within the european union to enable us better to investigate the crime which occurs .
i do not agree with mr gahrton that the former swedish national head of police is particularly concerned that there may be some overlap between interpol and europol .
in fact , i recently visited lyon with bj&ouml;rn eriksson , where we talked about how europol and interpol should cooperate and how this relationship might be formalised .
this cannot be done before the europol convention is ratified by the fifteen member states , however .
the question raised by the honourable member is a very important one , namely how complaints can be made about europol operations .
bearing in mind how important it is that the court should be involved and act as a complement to the commission , this is particularly significant .
this is why i , and many others , hope that the uk will at last be able to accept the court 's playing a role in the europol convention .
question no 23 by eva kjer hansen ( h-0274 / 96 )
subject : fraud against community resources
what instruments does the commission believe would give the community the practical means required to impose such sanctions and does the commission have the political power to introduce them ?
the commission uses all appropriate means in its fight against fraud which damages the community 's economic interests .
the most recent programme of work to combat fraud indicates clearly where the priorities lie .
there are four main points .
the first concerns an increased presence in the field .
the second is to strengthen cooperation between the commission and the member states , inter alia by establishing cooperation agreements and holding seminars and courses on the application of statutory provisions , including criminal law provisions .
the third main point concerns improving community legislation .
the fourth point deals with the need for greater harmonisation of the member states ' national legislation .
the commission has looked at the issue of sanctions as part of both point 3 and point 4 .
in this context it is important to distinguish between administrative sanctions and penalties under the criminal law .
i should first like to discuss administrative sanctions .
in december 1995 council regulation 2988 / 95 was adopted .
it was based on article 235 of the treaty of rome and article 203 of the euratom treaty .
the regulation contains general rules governing the administrative sanctions which should be applied in the event of irregularities .
all areas of community expenditure are covered , as are own resources .
as you know , sanctions have already been introduced in certain areas , such as agriculture .
the member states have submitted reports on national measures to combat the waste and mismanagement of community resources .
this is also what the council of ministers asked for .
i will now turn to criminal sanctions .
the convention on the protection of the community 's financial interests was signed in july 1995 .
it thus awaits ratification by the parliaments of all fifteen member states and i truly hope that this will be achieved as soon as possible .
the convention lays down that fraud is a criminal offence .
it covers both community resources obtained on false grounds and the withholding of own resources .
a number of additional protocols to the convention are planned , one of which concerns the issue of corruption .
the question of sanctions is also dealt with .
another protocol will deal with the responsibilities of legal persons under the criminal law , such as increased cooperation on legal issues .
within the framework of the current intergovernmental conference the commission has also proposed that the battle against fraud should be incorporated in the first pillar .
i would like to express my thanks for the reply and for the summing up of the contents of the work programme and the provisions already adopted .
however , i would like to ask the commissioner to confirm that it is an untenable position for us not to have common sanctions in all areas .
if there are no such provisions , then there will always be a difference , and that means that there will be those who can get off lightly by circumventing the common rules .
i would therefore ask the commissioner to confirm that what we are trying to achieve is a common system of sanctions in all areas .
may i also ask a question regarding the system of sanctions in relation to the member states ?
the situation is that where the member states ' do not implement rules laid down in law , the commission is able to impose sanctions on them in the form of fines .
we have not yet seen a single example of this option being used .
will the commissioner also make use of sanctions against member states in future ?
of course we shall do our best to exercise control in all areas .
however , the honourable member knows as well as i do that it is in fact an enormous step forward that we have obtained the convention to protect our common resources .
we can only go on with additional protocols and so on , in order to arrive at common forms of cooperation , once the convention has been ratified by all the parliaments .
a brief follow-up question : 70-80 % of eu resources are used within the individual member states .
i very recently saw in my own country , sweden , that it had been suggested there that a special national body should be set up to deal with fraud involving eu funds .
i consider this to be a good initiative because it would also make it easier to press on in the individual member states without perhaps having to resort to common , possibly even supranational , sanctions .
my question is as follows . will commissioner gradin do her best to ensure that similar national bodies are established in other member states in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity ?
it is correct that 80 % of eu resources are disbursed to member states .
i have also seen that sweden is thinking of appointing a delegation to check that resources are being used in the correct manner .
we are conducting a dialogue with all fifteen member states concerning which system would suit each individual country and that system is then laid down in an agreement .
as things stand we have six agreements and are continuing efforts to find solutions .
in this connection it is those countries with a federal system which present the stumbling block .
this is an extremely serious problem .
as the author is not present , question no 24 lapses .
question no 25 by maj theorin ( h-0254 / 96 )
subject : extension of the common foreign and security policy to common defence
in its opinion on the holding of an intergovernmental conference ( com ( 96 ) 90 final ) the commission believed ' that a proper common foreign and security policy has to extend to common defence .
the commission therefore calls on the conference to allow the union to review the role of the western european union with a view to incorporating it into the union according to a settled timetable ' .
what does the commission consider to be the implications under international law of thus extending the common foreign and security policy for those member states of the union which are neutral and militarily non-aligned ?
will they have to leave the eu ?
if in individual cases member states are to be allowed to play no part in military missions , will they still be obliged to make a financial contribution to them ?
i therefore find it rather difficult for the commission itself to give further information on this opinion outside the igc .
the commission opinion in question must certainly not be interpreted as implying that any member states will have to leave the union .
all the individual aspects of the member states ' obligations will , of course , be dealt with in detail at the igc .
it is also a fact that the weu comprises member states , 27 of them , the status of which varies as regards their role in the weu .
this naturally gives rise to considerable ambiguity and uncertainty as regards the obligations the countries have vis-&agrave;-vis one another .
would new eu member states perhaps not also have to be covered by the weu mutual security guarantees , and what consequences would that have for the eu 's relations with russia ?
these are all relevant and important questions in the debate on security cooperation in the european union and its implications for defence .
but let me give the honourable member one example of how we can overcome the difficulties that she has identified .
you know that the igc is also to have detailed discussions on the decisionmaking process in matters of foreign and security policy .
a very important question , for example , is whether or not we should abandon the right of veto which currently applies .
let me give you a hypothetical example , which is certain to be discussed in the negotiations at the igc .
this is just a hypothetical example , in the sense that nothing has been decided yet .
i cannot say any more at the moment without pre-empting the outcome of negotiations at the igc .
mr president , i should like to begin by abusing the privilege of the microphone to congratulate the commissioner on the success of the donors ' conference on saturday .
i know he put a lot of personal work into it .
i have two questions .
firstly , it has been suggested that the way around this particular problem would be to suspend article 5 of the weu treaty and therefore perhaps make it easier to integrate neutral states into a future defence union .
what is the commissioner 's view on whether that is a feasible possibility - to suspend article 5 ?
secondly , the commissioner quoted article j.4 , the wording of which is engraved on my heart .
it talks about the eventual framing of a common defence policy which may , in time , lead to a common defence .
therefore it is a long-term objective .
i should like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to mr titley .
i saw him at the conference for yugoslavia , and we are all grateful for the fact that the international community has in any event accepted its responsibility to help fund the reconstruction and rehabilitation of bosnia .
so i really cannot say whether this would be an answer to the problem .
i also wonder whether it would be easy to reach agreement on releasing countries from their obligation to provide mutual assistance in this way .
we are currently in the middle of discussions on what we are going to do as regards the union 's defence policy , a subject which i hope will be given serious consideration at the intergovernmental conference .
is this policy going to come under the western european union ? is the western european union going to be incorporated into the european union ?
this is what the commission has recommended in its opinion , and the question now is what the relationship will be between the european union 's defence capacity and nato 's defence capacity .
i hope that this is a subject we shall be able to return to on other occasions at question time .
i should like to thank the commissioner for his reply .
i should also like to talk about the commission 's views on the intergovernmental conference .
let us imagine that it will be as the commission wishes , that foreign policy will be decided by qualified majority voting and that the weu will be integrated in the european union .
let us then imagine a situation in which the union is drawn into an armed conflict and the non-aligned countries choose not to send troops as you described .
do you consider that neutrality in the strictest sense is possible for a nonaligned country which is a member of the european union ?
one final comment on the issue of majority voting versus the veto .
question no 26 by birgitta ahlqvist ( h-0259 / 96 ) , which has been taken over by mrs theorin
subject : eu and belarus
the development of democracy in belarus must be closely monitored .
the constitution confers considerable powers on the president at the same time as the parliament has a great many vacant seats because of the election laws .
allegations of election rigging have been made .
the european parliament has protested ( 12.10.1995 ) against the authorities ' conduct during a strike in minsk in august 1995 .
the eu has now concluded an interim agreement with a view to a partnership agreement with belarus .
it has been announced that belarus and russia will form a union on 2 april .
what form this union will take has not yet been explained but the opposition in belarus have protested strongly against the proposal .
has the commission investigated whether genuine freedom of the press and association exist in belarus ?
is the commission listening to the criticism by the opposition in belarus of the country 's curtailment of democratic freedoms and rights ?
we believe that belarus took a major step forward in 1995 when , despite its rather rigid electoral laws , it finally managed to elect a new parliament .
the people of belarus have shown that they want a democratically elected parliament , and president lukaschenko finally accepted the result and offered the parliament his personal cooperation and that of his government .
the main criticism once again concerned limitations on the freedom of the press during the election campaign .
we also know that the ratification of the partnership agreement is now before parliament .
this is a broader agreement than the interim agreement recently signed by the council and the commission , and the house will certainly be reaching its own conclusions on it .
once again , it is extremely difficult to predict at the moment how things are likely to develop on a political level .
i would therefore hope that the signature by the council and the commission did not take the house by surprise .
commissioner , i am interested in a number of points in relation to what you have said .
firstly , what practical effect has the interim agreement had on positive , democratic development ?
how do you view the fact that decree no 336 , which maintains the ban on trade unions , has not yet been repealed ?
and finally , how do you view the fact that the legal text signed by lukaschenko has not yet been published , despite the fact that the future of relations with russia is the key constitutional issue ?
we actually discussed each of the questions raised by mrs schroedter with the prime minister of belarus when he visited brussels , though i have to say that the answers we received were far from satisfactory .
but the question was whether these extremely serious inadequacies which affect every aspect of its democracy were sufficient grounds for postponing the signing of the agreement yet again .
as i said earlier , this was one of the main reasons why i felt our decision was the right one .
question no 31 by friedrich k&ouml;nig ( h-0068 / 96 )
subject : more rapid completion of the brenner railway line
the commission attaches the utmost priority to the brenner rail project .
it has organized a number of workshops and other meetings with representatives of the governments and railways involved in the brenner axis .
in addition , the commission follows the work of the trilateral brenner commission .
in november 1994 a memorandum on the further development of the munich-verona railway axis was signed by the then transport commissioner , mr oreja , together with the transport ministers of germany , italy and austria .
this memorandum follows a route agreement , including the brenner base tunnel , reached in june 1994 and it specifies actions to improve the financial and economic viability of the project .
the community has committed itself to support the completion of the trans-alpine crossing on the basis of the guidelines for the development of the trans-european transport network and of the available financial instruments .
in this context , the commission has launched a study on the development of alpine traffic which will constitute an important basis for further in-depth economic and financial studies on the brenner project .
it also supports the efforts to create a public / private partnership for the project implementation .
by the end of 1996 the trilateral brenner commission together with the relevant commission service will submit a report which is intended to constitute a basis for a political decision on project implementation .
since 1985 the community has granted financial assistance of ecu 85m from the transport infrastructure programme and the tens transport budget line for the co-financing of feasibility studies and the upgrading of the existing veronabrennero italian line .
the european investment bank has meanwhile committed a loan of ecu 362m for improvements of the existing verona-brennero line which constitutes a preliminary phase of the whole project .
i am glad to hear you confirm that the commission attaches special importance to this project .
road capacity is limited and the environment is under enormous pressure , so rail transport is the only possible option .
my question , commissioner , is as follows . the council has so far refused to declare its support for the 14 priority projects .
what is the commission 's stance regarding parliament 's demand that the 14 priorities should be adhered to ?
i am grateful to the honourable gentleman for his further question .
we are well aware in the commission of the pressures that come both from the geographical features and the potential action of neighbouring countries .
the brenner project will continue to receive very substantial support .
commissioner , my question concerns the fact that mr santer has submitted a plan and put forward ideas for making additional resources available to implement the trans-european networks .
we now know that the brenner base tunnel project , in particular , will demand substantial resources : it is calculated that the munich-verona project as a whole will cost around &ouml;s 160 billion , an incredible sum !
and austria would be required to provide 40 % of that .
my question to you is this : do you think that this very important , high-priority brenner project will be entitled to some of the additional resources that mr santer now wishes to make available for the transeuropean networks ?
i should like to take his mind back to the essen summit .
that call - made , as i said , first at essen - was repeated in madrid only last december .
despite repeated , detailed propositions made to ecofin , ecofin has so far proved to be deaf to those appeals .
so far nothing practical has developed .
what we have done is to take account very directly of the applications made for transport ten funding support from the member states , which are now running at six times the resources available to us .
we know that there are budget constraints and consequently we have also made it clear that we would settle for a top-up that is smaller than the ecu 1.7 billion .
there still has not , so far , been a practical and positive response from ecofin .
we will therefore reconfirm that .
question no 32 by florus wijsenbeek ( h-0082 / 96 )
subject : checks on driving and rest periods : discrimination against foreign lorry drivers in belgium
is the commission aware that there is discrimination against foreign lorries when checks on driving and rest periods are carried out ?
figures show that 72 % of checks in belgium are carried out on foreign vehicles , while in neighbouring countries the figure varies between 15 % and 20 % .
what action does the commission intend taking to induce belgium to reduce these checks on foreign vehicles to normal proportions ?
the commission recently adopted a report on the application of social legislation in road transport in 1991 / 92 .
the report shows that in belgium , 65 % of those drivers subjected to checks on driving and rest hours were nationals of other member states whereas in the netherlands , for example , this figure is 20 % .
the commission has no evidence , however , that belgium does not carry out its controls in an objective way .
information on control operations undertaken in cooperation with bordering member states does not indicate any discrimination either .
the geographical situation of member states and the importance of national road transport companies can , of course , explain certain variations in the numbers of nationals and non-nationals that are controlled .
a small member state with high levels of transit traffic but few national carriers will proportionately check more foreign drivers than would a large , peripheral country with a sizeable national fleet of vehicles subject to community social regulations .
the returns from luxembourg , for instance , show a situation that is comparable with that of belgium .
the commissioner 's view would be correct if - and he lives in belgium himself - 65 % of all lorries on the belgian roads were foreign lorries .
this definitely is not the case , as the commissioner will well know .
therefore , there is still reason to believe that there is discriminatory treatment of foreigners .
i urge the commissioner to do something to ensure that directive 88 / 599 is correctly applied .
this is the first and foremost task of the commission - to see to it that community legislation is correctly applied by all member states .
luxembourg , of course , is a different case because if you drive for five minutes , you are already abroad .
we heed what the honourable member says .
question no 33 by hans lindqvist ( h-0150 / 96 )
subject : the bridge across the &oslash;resund
construction of the bridge across the &oslash;resund , between malm&ouml; and copenhagen , has just begun .
even at this initial stage , the environmental and financial calculations have proved to be incorrect .
the project now looks like overshooting its budget by hundreds of millions of danish kroner .
as regards the environment , it also appears that the limit values set for silt discharges etc. are going to be exceeded .
is the project being part-financed by the eu ?
if so , how much money is involved ?
is the eu planning to provide any further financial or other aid towards the construction of the bridge ?
over the period 1992-1994 danish access routes of the &oslash;resund fixed link received community financial support under the transport infrastructure programme , totalling ecu 21 m in the form of direct grants to the danish authorities .
in 1995 community financial support was awarded under the new regulation for granting community assistance for work on trans-european transport networks .
the co-finance studies for the &oslash;resund fixed link in 1995 included design studies , environmental studies , environmental-impact assessment activities and monitoring , as well as traffic forecast studies .
the co-finance studies for the danish access routes in 1995 included technical design studies , as well as environmental studies and monitoring .
further financial support is envisaged for the period 1996-1999 since the &oslash;resund fixed link is a key element in the development of the trans-european transport network .
indeed , it is a transeuropean network transport priority project .
the 1996 ten transport request for support for the &oslash;resund fixed link is in the form of interest-rate subsidies .
the commission is not aware of any substantial increase in the project 's budget .
mr president , i would thank the commissioner for his answer .
i should like to know whether the commission or the eu has imposed any environmental requirements in granting the funds for the bridge .
according to reports the dredging has produced more sludge than anticipated .
there is much to suggest that there will an incredible increase in traffic and the question is whether the construction of the bridge is really reconcilable with good environmental policy .
there is also much to suggest that the bridge will be more expensive than was expected .
it is possible that there might also be the financing of access routes such as the city tunnel in malm&ouml; and others .
will the eu then grant still more resources to this project ?
i should thus like to ask whether the eu commission has taken note of the judgement made by the credit institution standard & poors that the project as such will not be successful without state guarantees .
there is thus a risk that the eu commission is supporting a project which neither meets environmental requirements nor can be successful on the market .
is this the right way to use resources ?
my answer to that last point of the question is absolutely , definitely yes !
naturally , we are interested in establishing whether that is the case .
there has been absolutely no evidence of any description that would support this testimony .
in 1991 and 1992 the commission examined denmark 's compliance with these directives in relation to the project and was satisfied that no breach had occurred .
moreover , as far as the swedish part of the project is concerned , an application was made by the construction consortium under the swedish natural resources act .
that application was accompanied by an environmental-impact study .
the study , together with a number of sub-reports , was intended to form the basis of the swedish environmental examination of the project .
it is also understood that a danish environmental , non-governmental organization - the danish branch of greenpeace - was recognized in july 1994 as having legal standing to challenge the project on the basis of a deficient environmental-impact assessment .
however , according to a subsequent court ruling , work can continue on the project pending a final ruling .
you will not be surprised to hear that i am sympathetic to the idea of consideration of the development of a new community lending instrument .
president santer has revisited the idea of the so-called eurobonds .
assessments and investigations are taking place now to see whether a further and stronger case can be developed than was originally put for the establishment of a new form of community lending .
question no 34 by konstantinos hatzidakis ( h-0234 / 96 )
subject : development of the egnatia highway by the construction of vertical road axes
the phare programme already co-finances the continuation of some of these axes beyond the european union border to durres and to sofia .
moreover , it is expected that after the settlement of relations with fyrom decisions will be taken for the construction of the continuation of the florina / niki axes to fyrom .
the commission will of course continue its efforts to utilize all possibilities for further co-financing of these links within existing community mechanisms and instruments .
i thank the commissioner for his answer to me .
this constitutes a problem .
i am certain there is not a single project in the whole european union about which i would not say it is possible to make faster progress .
i prefer not to be optimistic .
i simply like to be realistic and it is realistic to say that over a recognisable period of time the strenuous efforts being made by all parties will result in a satisfactory outcome .
that concludes question time .
questions not taken for lack of time will be answered in writing .
( the sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
fisheries agreement with morocco
this agreement has been the main subject of debate in the committee on fisheries in the past few months .
we hope that that situation will not be an exception and will represent a change in the doctrine hitherto followed by the council and the commission as regards the legal bases relating to international fisheries agreements .
however , it must be admitted that at least we were consulted before the date fixed for the first payment of financial compensation under this agreement fell due .
possibly this is not the best agreement , the one which would have suited us best . but possibly , madam commissioner , it is the best agreement possible .
and so the committee on fisheries , after a debate in depth , has agreed to give its assent to the terms negotiated by the commission . we trust the house will approve it .
on the other hand , however , this agreement has shown the growing difficulty in concluding international agreements of this scope .
and that , added to the fact that third countries are gradually developing their fleets and their preserving and processing industry shows up the community fleet 's state of over-capacity .
the committee on fisheries thinks that up to the present this problem has not been seriously faced .
it is clear , madam commissioner , that the next multiannual guidance programmes will be very hard to negotiate , but it will have to be done seriously and strictly and not in a spirit of political opportunism .
madam commissioner , in congratulating you today and in asking the house to approve this fisheries agreement , we cannot overlook the fact that we must make a very serious effort to adapt our fleet to the fishing opportunities .
mr president , madam commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it will shortly be a year since the fisheries dispute erupted between the european union and morocco .
i can point to many events which have taken place since then and which we mentioned at the time in this assembly .
but underlying all that , as was also emphasized at the recent plenary sitting on 27 march in brussels , the urgent need to revise and strengthen the european union 's policy with regard to international fishing agreements .
i also view favourably the fact that for the first time , although belatedly , it has been submitted for the assent of parliament as we had requested .
but basically , i stress , in view of the experience of what has happened and for institutional and sectoral reasons , a new approach to international agreements is required .
politically the european union 's fisheries and external and commercial policy must be linked .
institutionally this parliament must be definitively associated , strictly and as of right , with the negotiation , approval and control of these agreements .
for all those reasons we appreciate the commission 's initiative in holding a seminar in may with this parliament 's members who are on the committee on fisheries , to debate the future european policy on fisheries agreements .
we hope that the quimper meeting will outline the foundations of a new policy and shed light , the light which the sector is asking us for at this time .
mr president , i wish to say that the liberal and democratic reformist group strongly supports and welcomes this agreement and hopes that parliament will allow it to go ahead through the assent procedure .
we welcome the fact that parliament has full power with the council over this agreement via that procedure .
in this agreement there are a number of aspects which greatly improve on other international agreements which parliament has looked at .
i hope there will be sufficient control and that money will be ploughed back into investment in terms of research locally and other areas .
mr president , with regard to the fisheries agreement between the european union and the kingdom of morocco , we ought not to lose sight of overall relations between the two countries and the way they have been developing .
in every international agreement there must be a symmetry which respects and , to the highest degree possible , satisfies the needs of the contracting parties .
in the negotiations morocco exerted pressure on the fishing sector condemning the community fleet to idleness with the object of obtaining concessions in the agricultural sector .
the arguments put forward , ostensibly conservationist , very frequently turned out to be unjustified .
the weakness of the european union 's position cannot be attributed , in our opinion , to the committee on fisheries or to mrs bonino , but is due to the attitude of certain states within the council .
personally i understand mrs bonino 's difficulties during the whole period of negotiations and congratulate her on her performance .
the agreement is not satisfactory for us because it creates a precedent for renegotiation of the agreement .
the european parliament has been consulted , and that is something , but we were also consulted too late .
i should like to associate myself with what some fellow-members have said with regard to the complex problems of agreements with third countries .
let us hope that we all reach a greater appreciation of the difficulties and realize what we have to work for in the seminar at quimper .
mr president , as i pointed out earlier in relation to this agreement , the eu needs to learn lessons from the problems that it has posed .
for example , there is the huge dependence of the eu vessels on access to waters of other countries .
as well as that , in some of these countries there is a desire to reduce eu access to their fish stocks because they are over-exploited and need time to recover .
we also need to change our approach to these agreements .
we should not use them as dumping grounds for the over-capacity of the eu fleet .
we are basically just exporting our own problem with all its negative consequences for these other countries .
we have to place fishing agreements in the wider context of responsible management of regional fisheries , giving greater emphasis to the conservation of fish stocks and the needs of the local communities .
having said that , there are some positive aspects to this agreement .
i welcome the provision made in the agreement for funding the development of the moroccan fisheries sector as well as for improved research on fisheries in the region and for better training of fishermen .
i also welcome the acceptance of the principle that the size of the eu fleet allowed access to moroccan waters should be related to the number of fish actually available to be caught .
as well as that , we really have to realize in the eu that we do not have the right to set up free-for-all fishing in moroccan waters or in the waters of any other country .
however , the council 's decision to apply the agreement provisionally restricts the part played by parliament and partly neutralizes this more democratic trend .
mr president , the regulation now before us on an agreement with morocco concerns more than the fishing industry .
european horticulture is also affected by this agreement , albeit indirectly .
without the trade concessions in the sphere of importation of moroccan vegetables , fruit and flowers the agreement would never have come about .
european horticulture has thus unfairly become the victim of the solution to the fisheries dispute between the union and morocco .
to alleviate the pain the union undertook at the general affairs council of 10 november 1995 to make proposals for a fund to promote ornamental plant products .
so far , six months later , the commission has not yet followed up that commitment .
that is unacceptable !
i expect specific proposals from the commission at the earliest possible date .
this is a sector which is in difficulties , partly owing to increasing imports from third countries as a consequence of the tariff concessions granted in recent years .
products from third countries are therefore being imported almost entirely without duties .
it is high time that the european union did something about it .
is the commissioner ready to give an undertaking ?
if so , then i can vote for the regulation .
in the fisheries sector proper , negotiations with morocco in the framework of the european union have so far been favourable for portugal .
portugal now has three times more fishery permits in morocco than it had in 1995 and its fishery rights are now maintained by a formal legal basis and not merely by a framework of individual licences .
that is why we have fought coherently and continuously for this agreement .
any future agreements will have to call for a smaller fleet to be licensed and will also introduce mixed enterprises , the sustained management of fishery resources .
no responsible person can sit in the shade of a banana tree because fishermen are not and never have been dependent on subsidies - they just want to work .
thirdly , we must have a new fisheries policy .
a new common fisheries policy must be a sustainable and responsible one in which international agreements cannot simply involve exporting structural readjustments of the community fleet .
mr president , i welcome the arias ca&ntilde;ete report .
i welcome the agreement and i welcome the fact that the commission was able to reach this agreement with morocco .
it was a very difficult position and i therefore am delighted about the new agreement .
having said that , it would be wrong of me not to draw attention to the future of these fishing agreements .
the morocco agreement is the most important one .
we must not allow in the future huge expenditure on a commodity that perhaps can be caught in other ways .
we must recognise the fact that we have acp agreements and other developing country arrangements .
within this parliament we may have difficulty in looking at this overall relationship .
i believe that we have to be careful in the future , and this may have implications for our spanish colleagues and their fishermen .
i am only putting that down as a marker because i believe that the cost of fish is going to be an important aspect in future agreements .
mr president , madam commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i think we must welcome the fact that this fisheries agreement between the european union and morocco has been reached .
mr president , a cooperation agreement on fisheries has been concluded with morocco .
it cannot in fact assume the right to exploit a space not subject to the exclusive sovereignty or jurisdiction of non-member countries .
the moroccan fishing zones provided for in the agreement should be demarcated in accordance with the rules of international law , particularly with those of the united nations conventions on the law of the sea .
as the fishing agreement now stands , the riches of the western sahara territorial waters do not benefit the saharan people .
i therefore ask the commission , who negotiated this agreement , to make sure that international law is respected .
one concerns morocco itself .
remember the example of namibia , where there were mainly eu boats operating before the namibians could settle their own fishing policy .
we committed terrible things in those waters off the coast of namibia when there was no control .
let us remember those things and let us now pass the agreement , but remembering those points .
mr president , i wish to thank mr arias ca&ntilde;ete for his report .
as he normally does , he did a very thorough and informative job on this .
i support the agreement as well , because at this time it was politically , socially and economically important in many regions in spain .
obviously i am concerned that parliament is not getting its full constitutional rights in relation to these agreements .
ecu 500 m is a significant amount of money and we are entitled to codecision-making under the maastricht treaty .
whatever international obligations we have i believe should be subordinated to that constitutional right .
i am impressed by the figures that robin teverson gave us in relation to the cost per job and per vessel of this agreement .
they are relevant and we should take these things into account .
what could it do for aquaculture and tourism infrastructure ?
you could probably attract about ecu 2 , 000 million in investment and it might , at the end of the day , give greater economic benefits than it has in this way .
not just at this time but for the future , that is the way we ought to be thinking .
because , as james provan and others said , we cannot build a long-term fisheries policy on this sort of agreement when , obviously , there are many factors that will not be there in ten years ' time .
so we should look at the other prospects for helping the peripheral regions in a different way .
secondly , its articulation with the association agreement in the overall framework of a euro-mediterranean agreement with that country .
we are now going to be issuing an opinion five months after the agreement was approved and more than four months after it entered into force .
this situation , madam commissioner , cannot be accepted and should not be a practice in the future , as the european parliament has repeatedly stated and as you well know .
on the whole , these guidelines are in keeping with the proposals which we defended throughout , in terms of this agreement , even though they really fall short of what is necessary .
the negotiation of this fisheries agreement stemmed from another agreement , a trade agreement with morocco , which is quite clearly harmful for portugal .
mr president , most representatives of the andalusian fisheries sector say that this agreement is the best of those signed between the european union and morocco - simply the best .
let me sincerely congratulate the negotiators who have certain been a homogeneous team , which has acted firmly and calmly , waiting for the right time , and in the end decisively .
they have done well .
it is an agreement which was so difficult but which has turned out so well . and it is an agreement which allows us to continue , improve and advance our relations with morocco .
i notice that mr arias ca&ntilde;ete is not saying what he was saying before the spanish elections .
mr president , the first assessment we must make is of the agreement itself .
the compromise achieved is the best possible .
and this is the best agreement which could have been achieved in view of the stubborn and tough attitude maintained by the moroccan negotiators .
we must also congratulate the commission on having sent parliament a copy of the agreement as soon as it was signed .
that act is nothing more or less than one more sign of the spirit of transparency and collaboration with parliament which the commission and particularly commissioner bonino is advocating .
there is another aspect which is also worth stressing .
the council understood in its proposal that this agreement has important budgetary implications for the union . it therefore decided to consult parliament by means of the assent procedure .
that possibility constitutes an important recognition of the european parliament 's rights and powers .
we must therefore vote for this proposal for a decision .
in this case , although the agreement is rough at the edges , the union has worked for an agreement which was the least bad of the various options .
as the commissioner is present i should like to make a brief remark which may only touch on this debate , but is important in these times .
this is the anchovy season : portugal has ceded to france 6 000 tonnes from zone 9 which are being fished by france in zone 8 .
i ask you to act with your usual zeal and energy to prevent this frontal attack on this sometimes - but only sometimes - sacrosanct principle of relative stability .
many thanks and congratulations on the agreement , madam commissioner .
mr president , commissioner , it is kind of you to let me speak too on behalf of the committee on budgets .
like mr arias ca&ntilde;ete , who spoke for the committee on fisheries , i welcome the application of assent procedure on behalf of the committee on budgets .
that simplified our work in the committees .
nevertheless , i must once again voice serious criticism on behalf of the committee on budgets about the decision-making procedure .
this breach of contract by the council in curtailing the rights vested in parliament as part of the budgetary authority is even more serious than in the previous cases , since the agreement with morocco has considerable financial implications .
ecu 500 million is not chickenfeed .
i therefore protest formally against the systematic bypassing of this house and insist once again upon our contractually guaranteed participatory rights .
nevertheless , in view of the great importance we all attach to this agreement , the committee on budgets approved it unanimously .
we made our approval subject to three provisos , however .
secondly , we expect the council to make a formal undertaking that it will keep us officially informed of all negotiations on agreements and protocols , new or renewed .
we also call on the council and commission to reach a modus vivendi with parliament on the provisional application of agreements .
let me begin by thanking , on my own behalf and on that of the commission , the european parliament for the dispatch with which it has drawn up its opinion .
my personal thanks also for this important element after a year of very difficult and very complex negotiations which necessitated the intervention of the president of the commission .
i wish to take this opportunity also to thank those high-level political representatives , including those from morocco , who worked for this agreement finally to be achieved .
it is , in my view , a satisfactory and balanced agreement , things being what they are .
above all , it places the emphasis on an issue important to us , that of the conservation and sound management of stocks .
it is an agreement that provides important and innovative data as far as controls are concerned .
and so , in terms of controls to improve the conservation of fish stocks , this is an agreement that contains important new elements .
i have to emphasize two points on this occasion : parliament has recognized that article 228 has been applied for the first time , albeit somewhat tardily .
every institution has therefore to take responsibility for the delays and for paying due attention .
i wanted to talk a little about the financial problem and the cost / benefit issue .
for instance , it will be apparent from the dossier we are preparing that there are agreements that are in principle less expensive but , unfortunately , they are not being taken advantage of .
i therefore think that for all of those reasons , the quimper meeting is an important factor in providing us all with information .
a further important element in this agreement is that it includes a formal undertaking to reduce the dependence of the community fishing fleet on moroccan waters .
that is a specific undertaking that we have entered into because we take the view that to be 100 % dependent on a third country is not economically sustainable in any sector , including , obviously the fisheries sector .
let me finally draw your attention to another factor : many honourable members have raised the political issue of the relationship with morocco - the sahara issue and others .
i wish also to mention another point that almost everyone spoke of : the problem of the provisional application of the fisheries agreements .
imagine if , in november , we had said to our fishermen that they should stay in port until february or march awaiting an opinion on provisional application !
that would not have contributed greatly to improving the understanding of many important sections of public opinion in regard to the european institutions .
i believe , however , that trying to conclude balanced agreements founded on partnership - wherever possible and necessary - is the right approach .
thank you very much , madam commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at noon tomorrow .
health monitoring
what is involved here is making it possible to take stock of the work that has been done by comparing the results obtained in the different countries .
that will enable us to provide the member states with factors for assessment on which to base measures to prevent and treat the more serious diseases .
you have to be informed before you can take a decision !
the data to be compared needs then to be put together to provide a full picture of the health of europeans and , therefore , the diseases that have effectively to be combated .
faced with those difficulties , the solutions that appear in the programme are far from clear , in fact they are frequently hesitant and vague .
there is a reluctance to employ the word ' harmonization ' because , as you know , article 129 of the maastricht treaty prohibits the harmonization of health systems .
mr president , the committee on budgets has considered the proposal for the adoption of a community action programme on health monitoring and has , obviously , looked more particularly at the financial aspects .
mr president , in my opinion mr poggiolini deserves the socialist group 's congratulations on the sincerity and enthusiasm with which he has prepared his report .
in addition he has been kind enough to accept practically all amendments in committee and i thank him for that .
i also congratulate the commission .
as mr poggiolini has said , this programme is extremely important .
i should also like to stress that this must lead to the creation of a permanent structure for health monitoring .
but it is the first of the four to have a differential element .
and the position is that it is not an addition to the actions of the 15 member states but there is a joint management since it lays down a structure for cooperation between the member states .
it is a matter of a co-decision procedure enriched , moreover , by contributions from the commission , the committee on the environment and the committee on budgets .
finally i should like to thank the commission for its special sensitivity to parliament 's view .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , let me thank mr poggioloni for this excellent report .
the harmonization of data is essential to provide each country with a basis of comparison to enable it to review its own health policy and to allow each state to react more quickly and effectively to rectify undesirable trends .
data protection and security of data are paramount requirements .
for that reason , anonymity must be ensured when data are passed on .
that is very important to us as liberals .
these efforts are consistent with article 129 of the treaty , which enshrines the aim of ensuring a high level of human health protection .
we feel unable to support amendment no 32 , since we take the view that countries must also be prepared to play their part in financing such measures .
the programme itself is too poorly funded to allow for financial support to member states .
amendment no 40 - a relisting of the categories of data to be collected - is really a painstaking administrative task that is for the commission to undertake and not the european parliament .
mr president , the confederal group of the european united left - nordic green left supports mr poggiolini 's report because it is a substantial improvement on what the commission submitted .
and it is true that both the commission communication and the report constitute important progress and we welcome that .
in any event , there are three omissions in the report which we should like to mention so that they may be incorporated in the future if appropriate .
the first omission is related to the social context in which this report is made : it seems that the health of europeans is likely to deteriorate for three reasons .
secondly the difficulty of a health information network working well throughout europe when we are seeing a re-privatization of medicine and the resultant difficulties that brings for gathering information through the public system .
thirdly the threat of various epidemics which - as we are seeing - may come from russia and neighbouring countries .
the who has called attention to this and we must therefore improve the situation with regard to our health information .
finally the third omission relates to information .
otherwise we shall simply be collecting information for publication but not for action .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if there is any single sure belief shared by all industrialized countries , it is that fundamental choices must now be made over a public health policy .
this is what the commission 's document proposes and that is the message our rapporteur is conveying with some skill in amending that document .
parliament intended to propose a fully-fledged european health observatory like that set up in other fields .
the majority of the council preferred not to go beyond simple coordination .
the commission is therefore proposing to us a rather vague public health monitoring system , but whatever form this new instrument takes , it must be efficient and operational .
parliament wanted the health professionals , the ngos and the whole paramedical establishment to be more closely associated .
my feeling is that this wish has not been taken into account in the commission 's document .
thus , the commission proposes to analyse the state of health of european citizens , to evaluate the impact of community action programmes and to supply member states with information on that state of health .
mr president , we are discussing the proposed programme of community action on health monitoring .
the programme was already announced in the commission 's communication on the framework for community action in the field of public health .
it also responds to several resolutions tabled by members and by the council .
the general aim of the programme is to contribute to the establishment of a high-quality policy-oriented monitoring system in order to ensure a high level of health protection as required by article 129 of the treaty .
more specifically we intend the programme to serve three purposes .
first , the system should help to monitor health and health determinants throughout the union and permit comparisons with third countries .
second , the system should facilitate planning , monitoring , implementation and evaluation of community programmes and actions .
third , it should provide member states with comparative health indicators .
the answer is quite simple .
the data that currently exists is neither comprehensive nor comparable . therefore , it does not permit the monitoring of health and health determinants in the european union in a meaningful , useful and effective way .
this point was very much made by mr poggiolini .
in this way we hope to provide the maximum added value .
how can we do this ?
we will establish a set of health indicators which will provide the necessary information to establish the above-mentioned objectives and we will then develop a network for the collection and dissemination of the data needed for the indicators .
in the light of the existing technological capabilities we are planning to rely in the main on telematics for this purpose .
the interchange of data between the administration 's programmes , that is the ida programme , should provide us with the appropriate technical infrastructure for this network .
we all know that the availability of data , even comparable high-quality data , is not sufficient to ensure their usefulness .
we therefore also plan a number of activities related to the analysis of this particular data .
in particular , we intend to use the data to prepare our annual health status report , the first of which will be transmitted to you a little later this year .
we also intend to rely on data from the system for the analysis and the preparation of our annual report on the health requirements in other policies which was initiated last year .
these reports are currently being prepared using a variety of sources , the quality of which still leaves quite a lot to be desired .
i should now like to turn to the report itself and the amendments but before doing that i want to thank mr poggiolini and the members of the committees who have helped prepare this report .
they have done it with very great speed and for that i am very grateful .
turning now to the 47 amendments , i can inform you that the commission is in a position to accept 28 of these amendments either wholly or in part .
we accept fully amendments nos 12 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 20 , 23 , 24 and 29 .
we accept partially amendments nos 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 to 11 , 13 , 19 , 33 to 40 and 42 .
six of them are too restrictive . they are nos 4 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 and 38 .
six of them are not expressed in appropriate operational terms or may lead to some confusion if not properly worded .
they are nos 19 , 33 , 35 , 36 , 37 and 40 .
four of them are included elsewhere , namely nos 3 , 6 , 34 and 39 .
our position on some of these amendments deserves some explanation .
in particular , i refer to amendments nos 6 and 34 which concern the european health observatory , which was referred to by mr caudron and mr poggiolini .
i would draw attention to a promise i made at the conciliation meeting in december of 1995 that the commission would consider the idea of a health observatory very carefully .
any further decision regarding the actual establishment of an observatory will have to await the outcome of these deliberations .
with regard to amendment no 9 , we cannot accept the latter part which concerns the support for improved databases in member states .
pursuant to the principle of subsidiarity , this is a matter for the member states themselves .
for the same reason we cannot accept the latter part of amendment no 38 concerning the support for analysis of the cost-effectiveness of member states ' health systems .
mrs gredler referred to this matter in her contribution .
turning to the amendments which we cannot accept . the reasons for rejection are as follows .
seven amendments are not acceptable for legal reasons . two - nos 21 and 31 - because we cannot introduce into the programme the kind of obligations envisaged .
one - no 15 - because it does not conform with the precise wording of article 129 . four because they are inconsistent with the analogous provisions of the other public health programmes .
they are amendments nos 43 , 44 , 46 and 47 . two amendments are rejected because they fall outside the scope of the programme .
these are nos 26 , 27 and 28 . the remaining two amendments - nos 22 and 41 , concerning the size of the budget , cause considerable difficulty .
i should like to elaborate a little on the reasons for refusing some of the above-mentioned amendments . it is important that members understand why we are doing it .
against this background members will recall that in the case of the previous three health programmes , the budgetary allocations were only finally decided at the conciliation procedure .
amendment nos 2 and 21 which refer to the establishment of targets by member states are also unacceptable . firstly , this programme is a community health monitoring programme which is intended to monitor health trends .
in closing , i express my thanks again to mr poggiolini for his efforts to improve the community 's action on health monitoring generally .
our shared efforts will lead to a valuable and productive programme .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at noon tomorrow .
alzheimer 's disease - health card - blood safety
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
mr president , it is our common experience that , as people get older , we frequently come across cases variously defined as senile dementia or cerebral arteriosclerosis .
the initial symptoms are common to other diseases , for some of which there is an effective treatment , so that an early and differentiated diagnosis is crucial to avoid confusing the different illnesses .
it can take seven or eight years to progress from the initial symptoms to the terminal stage .
all of this means that the disease will spread .
it is estimated that of those aged 85 and over - and we are starting to see many 85 year-olds - one elderly person in 4 , that is 25 % , will be suffering from alzheimer 's disease .
this resolution seeks to encourage - effectively , we hope - the commission to draw up a multiannual programme of funding and initiatives concerning everything that can possibly be done to help families and sufferers .
clearly , the member states will have to understand that , particularly in the terminal stage , it is not possible to leave it to families always and exclusively to bear the burden of this tragic illness .
that funding has been used for the purposes i have listed and also been made available to the different non-governmental associations , alzheimer europe , for example , which brings together no fewer than 18 national associations .
the very important question i put to the commission asking how that ecu 5 million is to be used elicited what amounts to a very general answer from commissioner flynn .
however , we note that the commission anticipates attending the important conference to be held in ireland on 21 and 22 november next .
one important step in that direction will be the programme that we are urging the commission to provide .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the health card is an issue which has been of concern to the house for more than 15 years .
we consider that a health card would make it possible to prevent serious incidents involving the administration of ineffective or dangerous treatments , particularly in cases of chronic illness , serious illness or allergy .
the purpose of the health card is in fact to facilitate diagnosis , prevent the administration of inappropriate treatment or medication and cut the time spent on administration .
we are , of course , in agreement with the main points in the communication , but in our report we lay stress on certain aspects that appear to us to be essential .
the plan must also institute follow-up monitoring of the blood samples taken so that they can , if necessary , be traced back to the donors .
this is ' traceability ' .
but it is not enough just to select the donors .
the products taken from them must also be tested .
for this , what are called ' infectious markers ' must be defined and used , thus making it possible to recognize the possible presence of any dangerous microbes or parasites that could be transmitted to recipients .
next , it is important to define and harmonize throughout the european union the methods of treating , conserving , storing and handling blood products , to provide the highest possible guarantee of safety .
all these measures , harmonized throughout all member states , will allow blood products to circulate freely throughout the whole european union .
finally , blood transfusion activities and the transfusion chain must be continuously monitored in order to detect immediately any accident or contamination , to find its cause and to prevent any repetition : this is ' haemovigilance ' .
the second aim of this communication is to ensure that there are sufficient quantities of blood and blood products to respond to the needs of citizens of the union .
there are two possible ways of achieving this : either by reducing the quantities required or by increasing the quantities taken .
the professionals in blood transfusion - the nurses , doctors and technical staff - must become proficient in this rational use of blood products : hence the need for appropriate education and teaching in the training of students .
these products are mainly supplied by private companies , who use paid donors in order to make a profit since this is the only way they can obtain enough of them .
the european union also has such private companies which must not be condemned to disappear to the advantage of public institutions which would then have a monopoly .
one way of ensuring that these private companies do not pay their donors would be to compensate them .
the two vital aims would then be achieved : the safety and self-sufficiency of blood transfusion in the european union .
there is no doubt that medical and scientific research into this disease calls for a major commitment , considerable effort and growing financial investment .
we are obliged to find increasingly appropriate solutions to deal with the problems arising from alzheimer 's and other diseases related to ageing populations .
it is for the member states of the european union to define certain policies and strategies so that the whole problem related to neuro-degenerative diseases can be tackled in their medical , social , financial and other aspects .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the two aims being pursued are indeed the restoration and strengthening of confidence in the safety of the transfusion chain and the achievement of self-sufficiency in blood .
however , it is not very easy to accomplish all this as we find ourselves doing away with provisions which obstruct the free movement of goods and at the same time taking steps to guarantee maximum safety .
common standards will therefore have to be set .
but it is worth pausing a little and looking at these common standards .
and , just as farmers ' income has to be preserved , but not at any price , we should expect strict regulations to be put into place .
they should not be over-fussy , but they must protect us .
on the same subject , barely a fortnight ago in this very chamber , we had a debate on in vitro diagnostic devices : serological tests .
the monitoring and regulation required provoked a general outcry , precisely in the name of the free movement of goods .
yet only a few days after that debate , 50 000 hiv tests were recognized as defective by their manufacturers and the tests will have to be started all over again .
strict regulation and monitoring would have protected us .
we must demand that a standard file be drawn up on all donors .
we must demand that blood-saving techniques be developed .
we must encourage research on synthetic products and substitutes .
we must demand the training and retraining of doctors and nurses ; we must demand traceability and haemovigilance networks .
finally , in connection with the haemovigilance network , a truly harmonized european system should be able to rely on the regulatory framework already established in directive 89 / 381 .
the european parliament already asked for precisely this in its resolution of november 1993 .
i hope we shall be able to remember this after three years .
mr president , the european parliament did not wait until the maastricht treaty was adopted to place constant emphasis on all public health issues .
as mr leopardi reminded us , the house has discussed the health card on many occasions - but we are now lagging behind .
turning to alzheimer 's disease - we have said this on many occasions , and professor poggiolini put it very well : the ageing of the population is an achievement of the health system .
but just as the ageing of the population increases health costs , it is similarly bound to increase the incidence of agerelated disease .
here again we are therefore lagging behind .
as regards the communication on blood , i have to say that since i have been a member of this house , this is , i believe , the third time we have discussed this issue in the chamber .
well , here again we are lagging behind .
here again i believe that , except for those involved in the work , no-one would believe that here in europe we are not self-sufficient ; no-one can accept that blood in europe is not safe .
in addition , the knowledge of those working in the health needed to be improved .
this precious gift must not be wasted and we need therefore to maximize and make the best use of resources .
measures must be taken to reduce the number of transfusions , increasing the use of blood provided by the patient himself .
at present , there is virtually no treatment for the disease and no cure either .
it is inevitably a terminal disease .
at european level it is now estimated that over 8 million - equivalent to approximately 2 % of the over-65 age group - will be afflicted by alzheimer 's disease by the year 2000 .
of course , this figure does not take into account the difficulties of the families of the alzheimer 's sufferers , who are profoundly affected by the disease , both emotionally and practically .
all social life is disrupted and often financial and legal problems ensue .
in such cases there is tremendous pressure on those caring for those suffering from the disease .
in ireland the invaluable work carried out by the alzheimer 's society of ireland has made a significant contribution to supporting alzheimer 's sufferers and their families .
as europe 's demographic profile becomes older , it is clear that alzheimer 's disease will become an even greater social and health problem .
the commission must put in place , as a matter of some urgency , a comprehensive programme of measures to combat the disease and provide for more resources under its biomed programme for joint research into the disease .
regarding research , the commission also has an important role in coordinating member state research into the disease and ensuring the optimum results from such research .
it is important to heighten public awareness of this disease and to provide information to affected families .
finally , it is important that the european union give practical recognition to the invaluable work of carers who live each day with the traumatic effects of this disease .
in this regard , the allocation of funding for carer support , including respite facilities , must be urgently considered by the commission .
mr president , i thank the three rapporteurs for their excellent reports .
since i do not have much time , i shall go straight to the heart of the matter .
i do not believe there is enough money available for the fight against alzheimer 's disease , for establishing specialized out-patient facilities or even hospital wards .
this money is not to be used for the absolutely essential research into creutzfeldt-jakob disease either .
the commission ought to consider where else it could obtain these resources .
nor do i think that schoolchildren are the appropriate target group for public information campaigns on alzheimer ' s .
i do not think that we as a group can support amendment no 1 , because it is our view that research on foetal tissue is entirely necessary and should be permissible .
with regard to mr leopardi 's report on the health card , i have to say that free choice must be paramount .
my group will not be able to approve the report as a whole if the european parliament seeks to force this benefit upon people .
we also believe that the persons concerned should be given the opportunity to delete all stored data themselves .
thirdly , this card will be a great aid to quick and effective action if it is not overloaded with information in such a way as to make important details unrecognizable to the consulting physician .
so in my view there is no need to enter the names of medicines to which the cardholder has shown no reaction .
if i take medication at some time for athlete 's foot and it has no adverse effects , that information has no place on a health card designed for use in an emergency .
we must know from the outset what is more important to us .
social security or other health insurance cover results in my opinion in twotiered health care .
i believe it can be dangerous for the person concerned if he cannot immediately prove who is financing his treatment .
in our modern society , we have conquered some traditional illnesses but others have come into being .
the solution to alzheimer 's , like some tumours and certain types of cardiovascular disease , is certainly prevention .
to prevent that form of infection it is therefore vital that we pay the greatest attention to the difficulties involved in transfusion .
moreover , we have seen that , at certain times , the tests involve risks because they produce false negatives .
in the light of those circumstances , we need therefore to reinforce the preventive criteria and set in place all possible arrangements to protect our citizens .
mr president , mr poggiolini 's report deals with a problem which has hitherto not been much in the public eye : alzheimer 's disease .
the number of people over 60 suffering from this disease is growing alarmingly .
patients become completely dependent as a result of their illness .
care for such people often falls upon the shoulders of members of the family and neighbours and becomes a serious burden .
this report therefore rightly calls attention to alzheimer 's disease and its consequences and presses for further research , the provision of more information and increased funding by the european union and the member states .
such an illness and its social , mental and economic consequences cannot and must not be played down .
it is therefore with due deference and prudence that i put forward the following ideas , more or less inspired by an observation in mr poggiolini 's explanatory statement .
at one point he refers in particular to the fact that developing countries are little affected by this illness because life expectancy there is too low .
that is poignant and also significant .
longevity has become normal in our welfare society .
that is something to be grateful for .
but it is striking that in our society the current ideology projects only the image of the ideal person as young and healthy .
we are scared of old age , sickness and death .
the crux of this problem naturally lies in the loss of the purpose of this earthly existence .
without the hope of the gospel death is always final .
a disease such as alzheimer 's certainly needs to be tackled .
but let us learn to accept that sickness and old age form part of our existence .
in our society we seem to want to detach that from our daily existence .
by that we deny the value of our fellow human beings with their own place in creation . because that is what they are : fellow human beings , nothing more , nothing less .
mr president , i should like first of all to thank mr poggiolini on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists .
he has collaborated closely with us and has seriously considered and adopted many of our amendments .
what are we discussing with alzheimer 's , since that is the report i now want to consider ?
we are talking about a question .
i should actually like to keep the word problem out of the discussion . i have tried to do that too in an amendment to the annex .
it is not a problem but a question . that goes also for what mr blokland has just said too .
i think it is more a question .
what are we faced with in our society ?
and it tallies , as other speakers have also said . it tallies that europe is the continent of the elderly .
anyone who looks at the figures for old age in all continents notices that europe will have by far the greatest number of old people in the coming decades .
thus the young have the future , the elderly have the future , you should say .
there is something positive about that . but at the same time it brings with it issues and difficulties , and that is what we are faced with in this report .
to name one specific successful model , the alzheimer telephone .
our group cannot accepts amendments nos 1 and 3 , mr president , where there is reference to the use of foetuses for research .
we shall abstain on amendment no 1 .
it is i suppose a relevant subject , but not in this report , rather in a report in which we are discussing ethical limits in research .
mr president , may i begin by congratulating and complimenting mr poggiolini on the excellent reports he has drawn up .
i mean that genuinely and sincerely . i think it can be seen here that a doctor , actually a president of the italian specialist medical association , can also be a very good politician .
i greatly respect that .
in fact i want to include all the reports .
first of all there is the medical card .
it is a perfect initiative . i think a card of that kind may be of vital importance for the holder if he or she needs medical help abroad .
those travelling on holiday or on business can count on medical help and diagnosis without any language problem .
it should also be possible to make immediate contact with home in case of illness , since all those data can be stored on the card .
i think and hope that commissioner flynn is ready , now that we have the new state of technology , to take over this initiative which has been with parliament for such a terribly long time .
i turn now to alzheimer ' s .
mrs van putten and mr blokland have each spoken about it .
we must recognize that something must be done at european level to see how we can best find a joint solution . so that means that we must coordinate research at european level , exchange experience and so on .
last but not least , i should like to give mr cabrol my best thanks for his excellent report on the standardization and safety of blood tests .
in his well-known expert way mr cabrol has been willing to adopt those amendments too and everything has been approved .
thank you to the rapporteurs . they have really done excellent work .
mr president , i should like to say something about problems of safety in transfusion that should also appear on the agenda of a council planned by the irish presidency next autumn .
this is an extremely serious subject , when the memory of the controversies provoked by the contaminated blood catastrophe is still with us .
it seems that a few residual stocks still remain - some use of them has been mentioned , particularly by the armed forces - and for several years have escaped all safety measures .
it would appear that everything is not yet clear in this matter .
quite apart from the problem of aids , there are still said to be problems relating to hepatitis .
mr president , the affair at the centre of professor cabrol 's excellent report , i.e. that of contaminated blood , has not taught us a lesson .
what has led to contamination by bovine spongiform encephalopathy , to aids through contaminated blood and to creutzfeldt-jakob disease through contaminated meat , has arisen from a single cause : ideology .
in the business of contaminated blood and contaminated meat , capitalist companies have privatized the profits and nationalized the compensation for damages .
the polluter has not been the payer , it is the taxpayer who has paid .
mr president , i should like to congratulate mr poggiolini on his report .
i am particularly pleased to see this report on alzheimer 's come to fruition because it was a motion put down by me some 18 months ago that has led to this report .
as we have heard , there are an estimated 3.5 million people in the european union with alzheimer 's disease .
it is the most common , chronic , terminal illness among our older people .
in my own country of scotland , which has a population of five million , there are an estimated 61 , 000 people suffering from dementia .
it is reckoned that this figure will rise to around 73 , 000 by the early part of next century .
dementia is not just an old person 's disease .
the one serious point that mr martinez made is that we are learning that from some of the new cases of cjd .
there are between 2 , 000 and 3 , 000 people in scotland alone between the ages of 30 and 65 suffering from dementia .
dementia knows no social , national or economic boundaries .
therefore i believe it is ripe for action at the european level .
i hope the european commission will consider using this report as the basis for what could be called ' the first european action plan on dementia ' .
we need to do something at the european level to improve training and the quality of standards for the care of the sufferers .
the commission could use its good offices to bring together health and social care experts to disseminate good practice .
we could also use some of our existing research programmes such as biomed to play a greater role in fostering and motivating research in this particular area .
this seems to be a legitimate role for the union and the commission to play .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the health-policy experts are having their say this evening .
i wish to thank all of my honourable colleagues and in particular i should like to make some comments on mr leopardi 's report .
the quest for a european health card is nothing new in the european parliament ; back in 1981 it was on the parliamentary agenda , culminating in the so-called recommendation of the european community .
but at that time the health ministers were not even prepared to get together .
those were the days when health policy was dealt with as a purely national concern .
we have now moved on a bit .
firstly , parliament has a right of initiative , and i hope that the commissioner will make use of that to play an active part in this endeavour .
secondly , maastricht has given us coordination in the domain of health policy .
now my question today is addressed primarily to the commissioner .
what are the obstacles that have prevented coordination among the member states with regard to the health card in the past , and what can we do to remove these obstacles ?
i have tabled two amendments , and therein lie two points of importance to the president as well .
my first amendment was intended as an improvement , but the motion was so disastrously mistranslated that the german text says something quite different to the french and italian versions .
so misunderstandings have naturally arisen , since my amendment was based on the german text and is therefore somewhat incomprehensible to the rapporteur , who is italian , because it does not refer to his text .
in other words , communication broke down here , which is why problems have arisen with the amendment .
that is why my amendment seeks to exclude the issues of occupational diseases and social security cover , because they are so complex that we shall have to wait another hundred years for such a package .
i should indeed be grateful to the commissioner if he would tell us which elements he is able to endorse and what can be done to ensure that the health card will actually be introduced soon .
mr president , i congratulate mr cabrol on his report .
a man with his vast medical experience is a worthy rapporteur on blood safety .
the european commission 's communication on blood safety and self-sufficiency in the european union represents a considered attempt to restore confidence and to establish a specifically european response to the matter .
the commission must also urge member states to take appropriate action to achieve self-sufficiency on the basis of unpaid , voluntary donations .
for many decades austria has had an exemplary system of blood and plasma collection , which i should like to outline .
the mixed system comprises red cross branches , hospitals and industry .
the system , which has evolved over a period of time , consists of blood-donor centres run by non-profit organizations and of private plasmapheresis centres where plasma is collected for industrial fractionation .
back in 1975 a special law was passed to regulate plasmapheresis , the first such legislation in the world .
this figure was achieved by around 14 000 donors in 13 plasmapheresis centres .
the voluntary nature of these donations and the fact that the donors receive no payment are regarded as self-evident .
the plasma is not bought from the donor , although plasma donors in austria naturally receive appropriate compensation for their time and for travel to and from the centres .
each country has its own system , and all of them work more or less effectively .
we must accept that , in the realm of blood and plasma collection , the systems vary and operate on mixed bases .
whether these are commercial or nonprofitmaking , the aims for europe remain the same , namely efficiency and selfsufficiency .
mr president , i wish to bring to the attention of commissioner flynn the kind of problems experienced by european citizens which have been brought to me by a constituent .
a constituent 's son went to greece and suffered an injury there .
of course he presented his e111 form when he returned to the united kingdom but was told that the receipt which he had obtained from the doctor was invalid because it did not contain a perforation on it .
imagine the problem that young man faced : exhausted , tired and upset , he was required to insist upon a receipt with perforations on it .
the fact that he did not return that receipt with the appropriate perforations to the united kingdom meant that he was unable to obtain reimbursement .
now that inhibits , i am sure you will agree , free movement .
therefore , i would like you to look upon the proposal for a health card in the light of the time that we have already spent on this as a parliament .
you will recall this is one of a series of resolutions , the first of which was in 1981 . so we have been asking for this for a very long time .
indeed , mr leopardi , in an excellent report , says that much in part of the resolution .
this is the kind of thing that the socialist group has already designed and would be of great value to every european citizen when making their way round the single market .
we ask the commission to come forward with this and we hope very much that the commissioner will respond in the way i have described .
mr president , we have just heard from mr david martin a number of figures about people with alzheimer 's disease in the european union .
i should like to focus them still more specifically , mr president .
at present the european parliament has 626 members . the average age is about 45 .
one third of members are 55 or older .
statistically , within ten years five to fifteen of our fellow-members will be suffering from alzheimer 's disease .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , it is to be hoped that within ten years there will be efficacious therapies and medicines to prevent alzheimer 's and similar diseases and if possible to cure them .
but that depends amongst other things on the readiness of the european union to invest in the fight against such afflictions .
a community action programme with a special and not merely symbolical budget heading ought to be able to supplement the existing community initiatives and coordinate the campaigns started by the member states up to a certain level .
it goes without saying that the member states have a primary responsibility , particularly where reimbursement of medical expenses and social contributions are concerned .
one final point , mr president , we must not play patients off against one another on budgetary grounds or compare one patient with another .
but as rapporteur for community programmes on behalf of the elderly i must sincerely ask that this group of the population should not be forgotten .
in the year 2000 there will be more than 50 million of them in the european union , so more than one million alzheimer patients .
as a social personalist and a christian democrat i earnestly plead for a european approach to alzheimer 's disease .
that is a principle which should be recognized by certain member states which are still sceptical about a joint approach to certain problems as serious or as important as the three which are before the house today .
congratulations to mr poggiolini , mr leopardi and mr cabrol for their excellent work in which they consider respectively :
the health card , which must never , i venture to stress , become an obstacle to the movement of persons .
it must be made very clear that the health card is a voluntary matter .
it is something that will allow easier passage across internal borders and will facilitate freedom of movement and not act as a second passport or a second requirement .
bureaucracy must not turn such an interesting initial idea into one more obstruction or one more compulsory document .
blood transfusions , which are a major problem today .
they are a fully successful tissue transplant and therefore an extraordinary therapeutic tool .
without prejudice to continual progress in self-transfusion i think that the approximation of member states ' rules is a very interesting step .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i should also like to comment on mr poggiolini 's report on alzheimer 's disease .
let me begin by associating myself with the thanks that have been expressed to mr poggiolini .
he has certainly submitted a very good report , which deals with various aspects of the issue .
as a medic , i have also met patients with alzheimer 's , and i am aware of the extent of the problem .
i believe that mr poggiolini has adopted the correct approach and that the other speakers , such as mrs van putten , have set the right tone in this debate .
for that reason , i should like to restrict myself to one problem that particularly concerns me , namely the question of research .
where do the problems lie , and where are the boundaries we must not cross ?
this is a real danger and not mere scaremongering , and i believe we should bear that amendment in mind here today .
it was adopted at the time by a large parliamentary majority but was sadly rejected by the commission .
i should like to urge commissioner flynn to examine whether this idea of parliament 's to rule out any exertion of pressure is not in fact a sound one .
i believe we have the opportunity here to reaffirm that we are most definitely in favour of research but that the limit is reached when people start to be exploited as sources of raw material .
the green group in the european parliament has tabled an amendment rejecting such research altogether .
parliament will surely be unable to agree to that .
what i am tabling on behalf of the group of the european people 's party , however , is a compromise , and i ask you all to support our amendment no 3 to the poggiolini report .
so i wish at the outset to thank the commissioner and the commission for its communication , and the rapporteur , our colleague christian cabrol , for the quality of his work .
i want to make it clear that i support the communication , the report and the majority of the proposals , provided of course that some detailed changes are made .
while clarification was essential , the need to stress the safety of the donor and the recipient was even more so .
it is now imperative to promote the giving of blood by providing wide-ranging and precise information about blood , blood products and their use in treatment .
harmonization of the rules for the transfusion process , particularly as regards the selection of donors and screening tests , is absolutely indispensable and urgent throughout europe .
finally , this calls for the creation of a european organization for monitoring blood safety .
this would be an enormous advance for the citizens of europe .
the question of voluntary unpaid blood donation is very familiar to me : i am myself a blood donor .
the donors and their associations have suffered greatly at all levels from the effects of aids and contamination through transfusion .
today , they need to be recognized , encouraged and supported .
in conclusion , if tomorrow we are to ensure optimum safety and european selfsufficiency - often a decisive factor in achieving safety - we must act still more quickly and still more firmly .
the communication from the commission executive and christian cabrol 's report should help us in this .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , at this late hour i have brought along evidence to show that it has been worth staying on here this evening .
i have brought my own personal blood-donor card , which is linked to an emergency card and was issued by the austrian red cross .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i must begin by congratulating the three rapporteurs on the excellent quality of their work which lends the european parliament both prestige and value .
i should like to say a few words about what seems to be one of the most positive and future-looking ideas , namely a european health card .
the creation of a european health card is a positive idea and one which is in keeping with the project of european construction , which deserves our wholehearted support .
since i come from a touristic area - the algarve - and since portugal is a country of considerable migration , i think that i am particularly sensitive to the defence of this idea .
the treaty itself commits the european union to responsibility in ensuring a high level of human health protection .
indeed , at present , there are technical conditions for the creation of a european health document which can be accepted by all member states and by the various health system sectors .
this idea is far from a new one and it certainly needs to be developed and accentuated .
it is already ten years since the first council resolution in favour of an emergency health card for europeans , a project which came to nothing .
but now the times are different and this idea is more urgent and there are also greater technical possibilities .
so that is as far as we have got .
mr president , it is interesting that commissioner flynn should have been here earlier today when we were discussing a mainly young people 's problem , namely drugs .
here we are this evening discussing what is mainly a problem which affects the elderly - alzheimer 's and senile dementia .
as has been pointed out , these diseases affect millions of people throughout europe .
in ireland it is estimated that about 25 , 000 are affected .
the programme proposed would serve to initiate coherent policies at european level .
it would coordinate measures at national level and act as a catalyst for measures both in the public and private sectors .
i support the call that has been made for support for the families .
we know that many women have to care for these patients and these patients can be very difficult , troublesome and sometimes violent .
the families also suffer because the legal affairs of these people may have been left in limbo .
deterioration can be very quick and they may be unable to attend to their business affairs .
i also urge the commission to take up parliament 's recommendations for a voluntary european health card system by january 1999 .
finally , in relation to the blood supply , as mr fitzsimons pointed out we had a huge problem in ireland with the hepatitis b scare .
i welcome the commission 's proposals in this regard .
an increase in average life expectancy cannot be viewed as a problem but as a major achievement of our civilization , but that achievement has to be supported by the appropriate political decisions .
in many parts of europe there is excellent experience of work on alzheimer 's , but exchanges of information and the development of trans-national initiative remain at a low level .
that being so , the request that the commission draw up a programme of action to combat alzheimer 's disease and related illnesses is more opportune than ever and has our firm support .
mr president , i am pleased to have the opportunity to present the commission 's position on these three important health-related issues .
i deal first with alzheimer 's disease and mr poggiolini 's report .
this is a very constructive decision .
neuro-degenerative diseases have great social effects .
i am , therefore , particularly happy that your resolution focuses not only on the medical aspects of alzheimer 's disease but also on the loss of cognitive functions and equally on its social impact .
parliament has therefore reinforced the budget available for such diseases .
in 1995 parliament made a special appropriation of ecu 1 million for actions in the field of alzheimer 's disease .
this year it has added ecu 5 m to the public health budget line .
these are the very things you have asked priority to be given to .
so parliament 's report makes the point forcefully that alzheimer 's disease will become an increasingly big problem for european society . that is obvious from the demographic changes that are taking place in our society .
the accelerated ageing of the european population and the particular needs of alzheimer 's patients will increase demands on health and social services .
so there is added value in addressing these increased needs at european level .
the programme of activities which the commission will undertake should provide us with valuable insights into the correct approach to be followed .
given the scale of the challenge , i am sure that this is an issue which will confront us increasingly over the coming years .
i now turn to the question of the european health card and mr leopardi 's report .
the question of the health card has been with us , of course , for a very long time .
some members will even remember previous debates in the house on this particular issue .
both the resolution of 1986 , on the european emergency health card , and the council 's recommendations which concern the use of electronic cards , deal with the issues raised in mr leopardi 's report .
the feasibility of introducing such cards in appropriate forms and conditions has been studied by the commission .
research on the use of the cards in the health sector is currently a major topic in the context of the telematics application and the g7 information society programmes .
since 1986 the commission has held a number of meetings of experts to exchange information and to share experience on the design and the introduction of the health cards and has also supported some pilot projects .
the results have not been particularly encouraging as only a few member states have begun to use them .
however , a number of member states have gradually introduced electronic cards in the social security sector where prospects of a more generalized use are more promising .
moreover , as existing national systems would have to be used in parallel to a community voluntary system , citizens may be required to carry more than one card .
fundamental questions arise at present concerning the protection of the very sensitive medical data that you propose to store on the cards .
this is of particular importance in the case of theft , loss or unauthorized use of the card .
there is also the point concerning the responsibilities of doctors or other health professionals .
can they rely on the data for accuracy and completeness ?
do they understand all of the information therein contained ?
do they know whether it is complete and up to date or do they have to double check all information by running their own examinations to protect themselves from charges of negligence ?
what of the ethical issues , such as blood transfusion acceptance or , indeed , organ donation ?
what exactly it is to be used for and what information is to be stored on it are two of the key questions .
concerning social security : perhaps a more limited application of cards to become an electronic e111 form is feasible .
there is a case for practical solutions , including the mutual recognition of national insurance cards in accordance with the recommendation of the council on 29 september 1989 .
i am very conscious of what mr white says .
the particular card mr white has given to me for my perusal is considerably different from the comprehensive health record card under deliberation and the one that is being talked about here this evening .
perhaps it is something the house might reflect upon .
that might alter the whole attitude and the possibilities .
the main activities which were proposed towards this end were reflected in the council resolution of 2 june 1995 , which encompasses points which were suggested by the commission in its report at that time .
the commission intends to pursue these activities in response to the council invitation and in line with the wishes of members of the house in this area .
in fact , several have already been addressed .
a meeting of experts to discuss issues related to public awareness of blood and blood products is scheduled for next week in rome under the italian presidency .
also , work on a feasibility study on the establishment of a haemo-vigilance network should commence very shortly .
this matter was also mentioned by one of the members .
a project to identify existing practices regarding inspection and accreditation of blood centres in the member states is currently under way .
these are some of the issues we are pursuing at this time .
this has of necessity been only a very brief outline of the commission 's position on these three reports .
these are very important issues . i appreciate that they deserve very wide debate .
i would like to assure the house that my services will pay very close attention to what has been said here this evening .
it is my personal intention to seek progress in all three matters on behalf of the community .
mr president , i should like to respond to the point raised by commissioner flynn .
i am glad he read the card .
he makes a good point in saying that it is more limited than that described in the leopardi report .
that is a technically feasible possibility .
my concern is that if we make things too complicated we will go another ten years .
one of the big problems the commission and parliament face is the tabloid press accusing us of making all sorts of silly legislation which has no relevance to daily life .
this proposal by parliament would be relevant .
therefore , i wonder if you have looked at paragraph 1 ( a ) .
i would refer you to it .
i note what mr white says and i will pay particular attention to that particular aspect .
he and i both agree that the type of thing we are talking about here is a much more limited thing and designed to promote freedom of movement and mobility of people .
that is a slightly different thing and deals with some of the political , legal and technical problems which are associated with the wider data record card .
i take note of what you say .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will be held at 12 noon tomorrow .
( the sitting was closed at 11.55 p.m. )
approval of the minutes
the minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
this only records part of what i said .
i also stated that rapporteurs , when they accept reports , should undertake to be present at the debate on those reports .
i should like those details to be included in the minutes .
i can testify to what you say , mr fabre-aubrespy .
that will therefore be corrected .
( parliament approved the minutes )
european council in turin
it gives me great pleasure to welcome to the european parliament the presidentin-office of the council , prime minister lamberto dini .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the turin european council marked an important new stage on the road to determining the nature of the process of european integration in the future .
from this point of view the turin european council fully achieved the objective we had set ourselves .
in fact , the agenda for the intergovernmental conference clearly establishes the issues to be given particular attention in negotiating the revision of the treaty .
i consider it significant that it has been possible to achieve unanimous agreement on a list of priorities involving delicate and controversial topics .
other issues scheduled for examination relate to universal access to some categories of essential services , the simplification and consolidation of the text of the treaty which , after successive modifications , has become almost incomprehensible to the citizens .
for these reasons the second major chapter of the conference agenda deals with the representativeness , composition , and operating methods of the institutions .
in an international situation of turbulent change , the promotion and defence of our common values constitutes a profound argument in favour of the process of european integration .
these represent a series of tests for the conference .
although satisfied with the work done and the results obtained at turin , the italian presidency is by no means minimizing the problems that lie ahead of us .
the official documents presented by the governments of some member states confirm the existence of differences , indeed profound differences , on essential issues .
so the conference is going to have a difficult task over the one year period planned for its work .
fully respecting the duty of impartiality incumbent on the presidency , italy will work to promote the emergence of high profile consensus on the various subjects under discussion .
on 22 march the italian government approved its own document on the objectives of the conference .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the madrid european council granted a mandate for defining ways in which the european parliament could be closely associated with the work of the conference .
i shall not go over the various stages of that negotiation again here , as our minister for foreign affairs and under secretary ferraris , who is here today , have already had an opportunity to illustrate its progress .
the ministers for foreign affairs therefore drew up a compromise solution which the turin european council subsequently approved .
this results in an associative model which represents a substantial advance on the previous intergovernmental conference and will allow the european parliament to express its own views on all the issues on the agenda of the conference .
i would like to add my personal thanks for the helpfulness and cooperation shown towards the presidency in the difficult week of negotiations on the method of associating the european parliament with the conference .
one of the purposes of this exercise of revising the treaty is to prepare the union for the enlargement .
we intend to maintain assiduous contact with them and also provide appropriate information to switzerland and the countries of the european economic area .
the turin agenda is realistic yet ambitious .
it will not be easy to meet the commitment to complete the negotiations within the first six months of 1997 .
this consideration has led us to plan a tight schedule of meetings over the next few weeks .
the presidency intends to submit its own interim report to the florence european council to provide a basis for the continuing work of the conference .
the turin european council debated the problems of unemployment and job creation in europe at length .
it discussed the appropriateness of including an ad hoc title on employment objectives in the next treaty : this is one of the options to which the final document opens the way .
the council also dwelt at length on initiatives that could be taken more immediately .
on that basis the european council defined a comprehensive strategy and its content and detail has been successively improved at essen , cannes and madrid .
but we cannot feel satisfied with the results achieved .
at an urgent extraordinary meeting at the beginning of april , the agricultural council adopted a series of measures which bear witness to this commitment to solidarity .
this is a necessary process and will be intensified , but always respecting strict limits and maintaining adequate controls when the protection of public assets , health and the environment is at stake .
( loud and sustained applause )
mr president , mr president-in - office , ladies and gentlemen , on 29 march in turin , the european council launched the intergovernmental conference .
it approved the guidelines for the negotiations and the way in which the european parliament would be involved .
the decisions taken at the european council in madrid were therefore acted upon .
the document 's main aim , which is worth noting , is to ensure that there is consensus on the issues to be dealt with during the conference .
the fact that there was no such agreement before either the single european act or the maastricht treaty should be a salutary reminder .
it is notable that the basic document produced by the european council once again clearly focuses attention on the main problems afflicting our peoples , whilst emphasizing europe 's role in overcoming them .
it would not be acceptable to reform the treaty without first convincing our citizens that europe does really care about their problems .
unemployment , competition , the environment , social policy , internal security , increasing democracy , and the role of europe in the world are other issues dealt with in the document .
this does not , of course , guarantee that the work carried out during the conference will automatically be successful .
such an outcome can only be achieved through the efforts of the negotiators and the institutions to secure both a compromise and a quality result .
it is also worth noting that the european council has highlighted the enlargement issue - a challenge which europe must face up to in the future .
we need to outline a europe-wide scheme for peace and cooperation for the twenty-first century .
the number of debates that have taken place before as well as in the wake of the european council in turin , on topics covered by the conference and on europe in general , is impressive .
this seems to me to augur well for europe in the future , since it needs to elicit the attention and interest of its citizens .
however , an ' open ' conference , such as i have just described , does not take responsibility away from either the governments or parliaments of member states .
this ultimately remains with them .
the commission intends to carry out its role with this in mind .
it is the very model we are offering those countries whose aim is accession to the union .
however , to keep it intact , we need to introduce the far-reaching reforms set out in the opinion put forward by the commission on 28 february .
the citizens of the member states must feel like citizens of the union too , since this extends the rights of citizenship which they already possess in their own countries , whilst maintaining respect for fundamental rights .
if europe does not concern itself with the plight of its 18 million unemployed , then it has no meaning .
the union must project a strong image - a guarantee of peace and stability - particularly throughout our own continent .
the institutions will have to be adapted to deal with the union 's new dimensions and responsibilities .
the principle of unanimity causes paralysis , particularly as regards enlargement .
flexibility must therefore be considered and parliament 's role strengthened if we wish to establish a firm democratic reference point .
we cannot offer applicant countries membership of a union that is neither sufficiently prepared nor democratic enough to welcome them .
it concerned my proposal to introduce a european pact on employment , which i had the opportunity of putting forward in turin .
the heads of state and government reaffirmed their commitment to job creation and agreed to attach the utmost importance to this issue at the council meeting in florence .
the italian presidency also intends to convene a tripartite conference on growth and employment in rome in mid-june for governments , the social partners and the commission .
my aim is to encourage actions to combat unemployment .
it is clear that most of these measures need to be carried out at national level .
i do not wish to impose my own ideas , but rather encourage a dialogue between governments and social partners , in order to boost confidence .
there is no need to come up with radical new solutions : the basic ideas can be found in the commission 's white paper , approved in 1993 , on growth , competitiveness and employment .
what we are lacking is a coherent policy on employment through which to implement its proposals .
governments and the social partners have a special responsibility to combat unemployment .
our european pact on employment will make progress because we cannot do without it . the solidarity it will inspire will provide the dynamism that europe needs to make full use of its employment potential .
the socialist group shares that view .
i would add personally that in the last few months italy 's role as a proeuropean country committed to building the european union , a role which had seemed to be missing or even lost , has been reconstructed .
the socialist group also appreciates the work that has been done on citizenship , justice and home affairs .
of course there are unresolved problems , ignored by the council or inadequately dealt with , and they are set out one by one in the joint resolution .
so , while we appreciate the need for the reinforced cooperation clause , it is not clear whether and how it also guarantees the necessary institutional unity .
it will be the task of the conference to resolve this , of course .
we hope that these negotiations will be completed in amsterdam under the dutch presidency by the end of june 1997 .
seldom , mr president-in-office of the council , has a tableau been drawn up so full of fundamental questions and challenges facing the european union .
seldom too in the history of european unification was the risk so great that we would lose control of the political goal to which our generation owes decades of peace and prosperity .
that is the reason for our political responsibility in the months ahead .
we have inherited the fifty years which is now drawing to a close from the forwardlooking political courage of the statesmen who planned and built up the community of peace and progress .
the question we must answer is the following : what do we want to leave to the coming generation ?
what kind of europe are we going to hand on to the younger generation ?
what kind of message of hope can we transmit to the young people who all too often in our countries are deprived of the right to work and develop ?
our people are frightened when they think of the future .
we do not underestimate the difficulties of the negotiations .
that would be the worst possible hypothesis , for that would mean a postponement of all the basic problems .
in this respect i would remind you of a famous declaration and confirm that our group will never be satisfied with the european convoy only sailing at the speed of the slowest ships .
the epp group can accept the way in which the european parliament will be involved in the igc .
a public debate was wanted .
this time a new treaty will not only be negotiated by ministers , technocrats and diplomats , but the voice of the people in europe will be heard through those whom they democratically elected .
one issue dealt with in turin stands out , although it is still clouded by the more pressing problem of mad cow disease , and that is the issue of employment .
it will be up to those involved in the intergovernmental conference to make good that shortcoming .
and that is a great responsibility , since the future of europe is at stake .
improving the effectiveness of decision-making in the council , maintaining the authority of the commission and simplifying parliamentary procedures are essential reforms as the union is now .
but the prospect of enlargement - which must be accepted , since europe 's goal is that of opening its doors - makes these changes unavoidable .
marking the existence of such an ambition at the outset will be a sign of hope that is expected by the great majority of europe 's citizens .
mr president , i want to thank the president-inoffice for being here just a few days before voting takes place in italy , an event so important that it involves all the political and social forces of our country .
moreover we feel there is insufficient commitment to dealing with the most serious problem in every european country , the problem of employment .
i think a different commitment is needed , one that involves all the social partners , and first and foremost the trade unions of the european countries .
presidents h&auml;nsch , santer and dini , ladies and gentlemen , one particular image of the turin summit sticks in my mind .
the project to revise the treaty , of course , had a spanner in its works from the very beginning , and in our view the turin council summit has done nothing to alter that .
the cosmetic involvement of the european parliament that was decided upon is miles away from what we ourselves were demanding , namely a role in the ratification process .
public participation and debate in the widest possible sense are the only ways to overcome the clandestine nature of the intergovernmental conference and to let public acceptance gain ground over euroscepticism .
the fact is , of course , that the european union pursues an unfathomable policy , its words speaking of transparency but its actions of secrecy .
so we can scarcely wonder at people being every bit as distant from the eu as the eu is from democracy .
the tide did not turn at turin , and that is certainly not the fault of the presidency , which tried very hard .
klaus h&auml;nsch asked the council not to let its meetings degenerate into declaratory summits , but now , when i compare the statements with what is actually happening , mr h&auml;nsch 's call remains a pious wish .
so what are the candidate countries to think of the outcome , of the fact that foremost importance attaches to economic harmonization , when they played no part whatsoever in the conference ?
that is something they ought to tell us .
where , then , are the guidelines for improving the environmental situation ?
what are we to think of the decisions on mad cow disease ?
when was there a better time than now to make the switch towards species-related husbandry , natural feeding and controllable markets and away from the agroindustrial mentality ?
mr president , despite all the speeches and promises , the maastricht treaty appears increasingly to be the biggest stumbling-block to economic recovery and the fight against unemployment .
the figures are disastrous .
in europe , the average rate of unemployment rose from 9.6 % to 11 % between 1990 and 1995 .
six million jobs have been lost and 55 million people are living on the poverty line .
while fanatical supporters of european integration have for years been doing their utmost to advance the process of building europe , or so they claim , industrial production has stagnated and social breakdown has become worse .
while some of their leaders engage in trivial pursuits , the french people are growing increasingly concerned about relinquishing national sovereignty , and how this will affect their daily lives .
in this respect , the idea put about in some quarters of increased cooperation between some member states , with others constructively abstaining - what a joke !
- can only be a prelude to further withdrawals .
this puts us in mind of the fourth republic , and what is known as the policy of letting sleeping dogs lie .
a new referendum is now in order , in view of the insidious implementation of a federalist treaty that only just secured enough votes in 1992 .
the proposed changes arising out of the intergovernmental conference should provide a good reason for again asking the french people whether they are willing to entrust the most important aspects of french economic policy to supranational bodies .
life shows that any living creature that gives up the struggle is condemned to extinction !
parliament 's lack of interest in your appearance , demonstrated by this empty chamber , is a response to the lack of interest you have demonstrated towards us .
the president of the italian parliament , mr pivetti , came here to testify to the interest italian members of parliament take in their european colleagues .
you never came , and you represent the italian presidency .
but you come today , four days away from the italian election .
perhaps your presence today is not even a belated apology to all of us who have been elected , but another attempt to use the european platform for base domestic motives .
but you should know you have done your country a disservice .
decent men are capable of a little humility .
shrewd politicians know that the form is often the substance and in terms of form you have been extremely rude to this parliament .
this state of stagnation stands in the way of the creation of new wealth .
you are silent about relocation , about fundamentalism , about the deaths caused by failure to achieve political union .
as regards the verona summit , i merely point out that the economic disorder which prevents italy from enjoying the necessary credibility is the responsibility of many of your current electoral partners .
welcome
the visiting delegation is led by the president of the thai national assembly and includes parliamentarians from indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , singapore and vietnam .
on behalf of our entire house , may i bid you a warm welcome to the european parliament and wish you every success in the work you are about to begin .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen of the aipo , welcome to the european parliament !
( loud applause )
european council in turin ( continuation )
mr president , i have listened with great interest to the views expressed this morning by honourable members of the european parliament .
europe has been an area of progress and prosperity in the past and we intend to make it so in the future .
i do not agree that the turin document is vague .
there will , i believe , be another opportunity for the italian president-inoffice of the council to come and report on the outcome of the june european council before the end of the italian presidency .
already , however , as the igc , you have made the first historic mistake .
you have excluded us from your work .
take note that this will stand in your way .
our parliament 's voice has been devalued .
i was surprised to learn that our two representatives , who will be silent recipients of regular information from you , had gone as far as actually to thank you for your relative willingness to provide it .
you should know , however , that parliament does not thank you , but blames you most severely for its exclusion .
unfortunately , however , your conference does not seem to have the power to make history .
some do not wish to , and others do not dare .
no strengthening of the union 's bodies , nor any deepening of cohesion .
it is indeed unbelievable that you proclaimed the protection of our frontiers in a limited way and no more than that , and so did a disservice to the peoples who bear the brunt of safeguarding europe 's frontiers .
on the subject of a more multi-speed europe too , we have not heard positive messages .
our aim should be to make the differences between the strong and the weak less pronounced , not to give those differences official expression and establish them institutionally .
i am still not sure that in the hands of this igc the ideal of a united europe will gain ground .
europe 's credibility is in your hands .
do not sacrifice it on the altar of any minor political expedients , whatever those may be .
it would be a pity for history one day to pronounce that your hands were shown to be lacking in strength and not entirely up to the opportunities this historic time offers .
will europe happen ?
mr martens for the ppe and other group presidents , setting aside some provincial propaganda which was exclusively for domestic use , have given the italian presidency credit for ensuring that the igc has made a good start .
mr president , i yield to the temptation to borrow a phrase from sir christopher wren on this occasion : ' si monumentum requieres , circumspice ' .
there was nothing to report , sadly .
in fact it would have been long-forgotten but for the fact that the major item for discussion was the bse disease and that the conference itself was held in the ferrari buildings .
the european union and its member states have a number of very major political , social and economic problems to confront over the next few years .
at the same time existing member states will have to prepare the way for the accession of up to 10 or even 15 new member states from central and eastern europe .
the likely accession of these countries will provide all europe with a unique opportunity to work together for a peaceful and secure future .
a straightforward redistribution of the existing resources from the structural funds and the common agricultural policy will result in the union 's agricultural regions taking on a disproportionately large share of the cost of enlargement .
the budget will have to be increased significantly if the existing common policies are to continue to operate effectively in an enlarged union .
after the igc conference there will be a wide-ranging public debate in each of the 15 eu countries and in some cases a referendum before the ratification process can be completed .
finally , during the course of these debates our citizens will be expecting clear evidence that the european union is capable of providing clear-cut and effective solutions to these major political , social and economic problems .
but a positive note has been struck , nevertheless .
we do note , however , certain omissions which are a cause for concern , but i would like to begin with the points which we feel are more positive .
it is recognised that the fight against unemployment must be our main priority - this calls for an economic policy which is orientated towards stability , greater competitiveness and far swifter growth .
as far as free circulation is concerned , there is an intention to implement coherent and effective policies in terms of asylum , emigration and visas , as well as stepping up controls at external borders .
the omissions which concern us start , for example , with the failure to make any reference to economic and social cohesion .
we are certain that the 15 heads of state and government will not call into question this principle because it is vital to european construction and must underlie all of its policies .
but it would be useful and reassuring if the principle could have been reiterated in the final communiqu&eacute; , something which did not happen .
the same concern is also valid for the problem of statutory equalities .
it is vital to ensure that demographic differences cannot have repercussions on the exercise of the presidency of the council of ministers , the representativeness of the commission or the equal status of all commissioners .
what is firmly fixed , following the meeting in the wellguarded factory area in turin , is some clear outline of what we can expect .
it is a clear procedure that has been adopted , and the outlines of the future union are more or less clear .
it concerns areas which are of decisive importance for the development of the european union .
i believe that we will do so again , and if the danish tradition is applied to the whole union , then the union project will encounter difficulties .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mr dini has just told us that the heads of government were particularly concerned about employment .
that is good news , and i think parliament can take some credit for making it understood that our citizens are deeply anxious about this problem .
mr dini also said that employment policy was above all the prerogative of the member states .
no doubt that is true , but there are three points which i should like to make .
firstly , parliament believes that employment should be one of our guiding principles as we move towards economic and monetary union .
in introducing a single currency , we must have a goal , and this should naturally be employment .
secondly , i believe that if the procedures approved in essen are to bear fruit , they must be improved .
in our view , it would help to make employment a truly european issue - and this is essential - if a chapter on employment were to be inserted in the treaty .
thirdly , there can be no employment policy without a social policy .
this concept needs to be reiterated .
but i should also like to mention the status of the european parliament , and to acknowledge the considerable effort which the council and the italian presidency have made in order to reach a solution .
i think the outcome is a purely symbolic one , but it should not be ignored .
the opposition of the french and british governments seriously affects us all . we must overcome france 's over-sensitivity about national sovereignty and the british government 's refusal to accept both europe and democracy .
but in its resolution last december , parliament also referred to the interinstitutional conference .
it seems to me that relations between parliament and the intergovernmental conference are more conflictual than amicable .
from an institutional point of view , this arrangement maintains a balance of power that is fairer to parliament .
mr president , i trust that you will once again put the interinstitutional conference on the agenda , in accordance with the wishes of the house .
and that is why the socialist group will be voting in favour of the amendment which the green group has tabled on this issue .
mr president , in his introductory remarks prime minister dini stressed how very important it is to fight unemployment .
i fully share this point of view .
however , the fight against unemployment cannot comprise merely fine words , not even if a separate title in the treaty is devoted to the subject .
the swedish proposal for an employment union is an example of this .
originally , this proposal was a proposal to coordinate finance policies and make them more expansionary and to increase demand in times of economic recession .
it was a proposal which really could have had an effect at european level in checking the recession .
now the proposal has been abandoned totally .
it was not taken further because it conflicts with monetary union and the policy of convergence .
this is thus another example of the fact that today the policy of convergence is the biggest single stumbling block in the fight against unemployment in western europe .
this policy must therefore be reviewed , as must the emu project .
if unemployment could be ' talked out of existence ' we would have got rid of it here a long time ago - but that is not possible .
i have received eight motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 12 noon .
preparation of ccee for accession
madam president , the white paper on adapting to the internal market , which is the basis for our opinion , provides an excellent indicator for membership of the union .
it does not contain data on accession , for that is up to the acceding countries themselves .
the speed at which they move towards accession and the ground they have to cover will dictate the time at which they can accede to the union .
of course what will happen is that in order to treat everyone at the same level we will have to choose a starting point which is at least symbolically and politically the same one .
for example it could be the commission offering advice on the various applicant countries , or it could be a symbolic starting time for the beginning of the process .
the path indicated can be travelled voluntarily , nothing is being forced .
we are not even forcing ourselves to do anything .
the white paper is not a recruiting instrument to enlist newcomers .
often applicant countries are well on the right tracks .
sometimes , however , they have a lot of ground to cover .
in this house we have debated the actions of the prime minister of slovakia who is making life extremely difficult for the president of the republic and we fear that things are not well in that sphere .
the rule of law and democracy and the creation of a responsible , well organised society is very much in the interests of the union and the applicant countries .
by emphasising this we are showing our clear support for democratic processes and forces in the applicant countries .
we want to be an alliance of countries based on the rule of law , with a proper community character , and not just a club of rich countries .
and so i think that we in this house should take a look at the community spirit of applicant countries .
for that could be a very good reason for saying yes or no when it comes to our vote , and we do , after all , have the last word .
the igc will have to prove that the present member states take enlargement seriously .
a strengthened union must at least make it possible for new countries to join .
at the end of their journey they should find a house and not a shack awaiting them .
europe will then remain impotent and be forced to call in the americans to help solve the slightest conflict .
the report emphasises the need for mutual cooperation between the relevant applicant countries .
it is good that we are getting away from channelling everything through brussels .
formerly they had to channel everything through moscow .
they will have to get used to working together , to trading with each other and to developing together , just as we had to in the union .
that is also true for cooperation with countries outside the scope of accession .
i am thinking in particular of ukraine , belarus , the russian federation , moldova .
we are not forgetting them and stress that trans-border projects with them are also a very important factor in optimising mutual relations .
the report also emphasises the social aspects because a situation of major changes can also lead to significant social harm in the applicant countries and so even undermine confidence in the forthcoming accession .
we also insist that due attention be paid to the environment .
important aspects are taken up by the many draftsmen of an opinion .
together with industry a code will have to be worked out for our own ailing industry so that we genuinely contribute to a healthy and sustainable development .
the report contains many sections because there were so many draftsmen of opinions .
it also calls for proper information to be provided for the public in the central and eastern european countries .
they must discover what european integration is all about .
strangely enough even some of the politicians there have little idea of it .
people in the applicant countries , just like our own citizens in the union , must clearly understand that we are serious about ensuring that no major mistakes are made and that the surveillance and antifraud procedures are operating .
the debate on security policy is also echoed in this report , particularly in the section on eu security guarantees or indirectly via the weu and the possibly imperfect overlap of our membership with nato .
the enlargement of the european union is a challenge for the decades ahead .
we now have the opportunity with the applicant countries to do something that for all too long was unthinkable .
enlargement will take time .
it is not possible , as one of the amendments says , that every time we take a decision we must wait until we have a complete insight into all the financial repercussions of the accession .
it will be a very long time before we have a complete picture and we must not do anything to depart from the strong stance we have taken in favour of enlargement .
there is a whiff of isolationism in the air even in europe .
but to entrench ourselves smugly in a fortress europe would be the worst thing we could possibly do .
the applicant countries are carefully watching our reactions and this debate must send out the right signal to them .
that is why i would strongly oppose any manoeuvre to postpone or set up financial barriers , for example , or undermine our determination to work confidently towards enlargement .
madam president , the white paper on the preparation of the associated countries for membership of the internal market of the european union only deals with agricultural aspects in a small way .
it deals with guidance for the associated countries relating to some agricultural sectors and connected with veterinary checks , the free movement of goods , phytosanitary products and fodder , and the requirements for marketing certain products .
to this end the oostlander report takes substantial note of the european commission guidelines which are very clear , very precise and do not leave room for subjective interpretation .
the problem for agriculture is a problem of outlook .
i believe , in agreement with the oostlander report , that it is not possible to say we will do the accounts first and then see what implications the enlargement will have .
instead it is a matter of working right away for the enlargement and adapting the common agricultural policy to the guidelines that the commission adopted at the madrid summit .
in my opinion this constitutes a good starting point for ensuring that the whole of european agriculture spends less on traditional support to markets and more on structural policy and rural development .
madam president , the economic affairs committee is in favour of enlargement but disagrees with the oostlander report on its timing .
an overhasty accession , in other words before the applicant countries and the union itself are ready , is not in the interests of either the applicants or the union .
first of all the union must through the igc re-assert its authority to take decisions and become more democratic .
now that there are no more border controls there is no longer any scope for a special status on the internal market .
accession might well take a long time , certainly into the next century .
but in the meantime the applicant countries should not be expected to travel that path empty-handed .
the present trade regulations with central and eastern europe are hypocritical .
the most difficult and restricted access to the union is reserved for the most competitive products .
it is no wonder that the european union has built up a trade surplus .
that must change quickly if the union wants to remain credible .
madam president , to deal with energy in the countries of eastern europe in just one minute would almost be a record !
but i am going to try and be extremely brief , if not terse , and say simply that the recommendation contained in the oostlander report touches on two main points .
firstly , we must take into account that the countries of central and eastern europe are heavily dependent on nuclear power .
and , on the other , to envisage a realistic timescale for the possible closure of nuclear power stations that do not comply with basic safety regulations .
the second point in the recommendation is that we must investigate all the different energy sources which might be available in central and eastern europe .
i personally had suggested that the commission should organize a regional energy conference in these countries , with a view to encouraging diversification .
madam president , we are aware that the integrationrelated problems of the countries of central and eastern europe are great , and that the starting-point of each country is different .
given that their social structures are diverse , we must look for convergence in terms of increased democracy , the rule of law and responsible administration .
i shall now try to summarize the three areas on which the committee on external economic relations wishes to place particular emphasis .
firstly , the transposition of the community 's laws into the national legislation of each of the countries concerned , with particular attention being given to social and environmental requirements , will involve a huge legislative effort .
similarly , a revision of the common agricultural policy must prevent increased rural desertification and serve to maintain the standard of living of the union 's farmers .
madam president , the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights welcomes the white paper .
a proposal has been made to strengthen the legal system by creating an administrative , organizational and legal infrastructure .
it will not be enough merely to inform the candidate countries of current community legislation .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to begin my remarks with three basic observations .
first of all , the gradual eastward enlargement of the european union is a task of historical necessity .
secondly , many countries of central and eastern europe are plagued by indescribable poverty and social deprivation .
thirdly , many member states of the union are also faced with serious social problems .
these observations form the basis of my opinion .
the fundamental requirement is the incorporation into the integration process of the social dimension as reflected in the european social model .
unfortunately , too little account is taken of this requirement in mr oostlander 's report .
this phased plan must include the social dimension .
the union must assist the candidates for accession to establish and develop socially orientated administrative and organizational infrastructures .
this socially acceptable form of integration will entail extremely high costs both for the union and for the acceding countries .
that is why the union has to adopt the appropriate measures in good time .
the necessary integration of the countries of central and eastern europe must be managed judiciously and in a socially responsible manner .
otherwise the unwanted social side-effects of such integration could jeopardize the gratifying democratic developments in the applicant countries and their commitment to the idea of a common european home .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the accession of the countries of central and eastern europe will bring about some very profound changes , not least to the regional policy of the european union .
we shall have to talk about who will then belong to the so-called objective 1 regions . we shall have to talk about who is to benefit from the cohesion funds and so forth .
economic and social cohesion will , of course , remain our aim . on that we are agreed .
but i feel we have not given enough thought to the level at which this economic and social cohesion is supposed to materialize .
we should remain realistic , and it is essential that we discuss this question of levels .
at the present time , regional policy rather tends to play a minor role in the european commission .
finally , let me make a comment that applies not only to regional policy but also to our entire approach to the countries of central and eastern europe . we always speak of these countries as a single bloc .
some even call them the ccees or peco . but in reality they are individual states .
they are civilized nations , each with as rich a history as the countries of western europe . i ask you to keep calling that to mind .
the integration of these states means far more than restructuring national economic systems to adapt them to new legal norms and regulations .
although in its white paper the commission only deals with the economic aspects of accession , it is quite clear that this can only be one part of the accession process .
the european parliament and the oostlander report have made this point very clearly .
our unequivocal position is that although economic adjustment is immensely important , the other areas - culture , education and the audiovisual media - should also receive the full attention of the governments of these countries .
the committee on culture , youth , education and the media , on whose behalf i speak here , takes the view that culture has to be seen as a separate issue .
the cultural heritage of europe must not be considered within the confines of the union alone .
in the domain of education , the committee warns everyone concerned to avoid putting immediate political gains - such as securing industrial jobs in the short term - before the long-term goal of high-quality basic and advanced training .
such strategies would lead in the medium term to stagnation and decline .
if culture and education are ignored , enlargement will become a mechanical process that can only lead to disillusionment and inefficiency in the long run , and that is certainly not in our interests !
madam president , it is the historic task of our generation to make europe whole , to remove the vestiges of 50 years of ideological dictatorship and repression in central and eastern europe .
yet peace and security also means freedom for crime and terrorism .
crime has spread in the vacuum left by the dictatorship .
criminals get through traditional border controls because their organizations have become far more international than the police .
we shall require the new member states to take action against mafia activity , drug-related crime , trafficking in human beings , illegal immigration , etc. and we shall make demands of ourselves .
in our own countries we have allowed crime to overwhelm us .
we continually deploy too much manpower at borders , where citizens ' passports and luggage are carefully checked .
it is to no avail and , furthermore , we cooperate far too little to make common cause against international crime .
this is a key issue in regard to enlargement , because if we are to sustain the public 's confidence in enlargement , then it must not be seen to be associated with rising crime .
madam president , real socialism leaves behind a catastrophic environmental legacy .
the alarming environmental situation is a real danger to public health .
the available know-how must be deployed to ensure that the quality of water , air and soil undergoes constant systematic improvement , not only in western europe but in the east too .
safety standards at nuclear plants , as well as the safeguards in place at the numerous storage sites for radioactive waste , are of the utmost importance to the entire global population .
the technical capability of the waste-disposal plants available in individual countries to recycle hazardous waste safely could be used as a criterion in decisions on waste management .
minimum environmental protection standards should be defined , and states should receive financial and advisory assistance to make those standards attainable .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the committee on institutional affairs regards enlargement as both a political necessity and a historic opportunity for europe .
however , we have stressed the fact that if the european plan is to be viable , the new treaty must first of all provide for institutional instruments that meet the requirements of an enlarged union .
because if institutional reform does not go far enough , it will endanger the very process of building europe .
we must avoid the risk of europe being watered down .
broadening and deepening must be reconciled , through in-depth strengthening and reform of the present institutional framework .
increased democracy , efficiency , solidarity and transparency must be the key elements in that reform process .
whether or not the union is ready for enlargement will depend on the outcome of the igc .
in this context , the committee on institutional affairs would like to lay down a condition which it believes is unavoidable , namely that the house should deliver a favourable opinion at the end of the negotiations .
fisheries , as it happens , vary greatly in their importance to the economies of the individual candidate countries .
nevertheless , there are common features , which demand a uniform approach by the european union .
the impact of integration on the applicant countries will be considerable .
our accession strategy must take due account of this fact .
the development of new economic structures and an integration process without traumatic consequences must be our stated objectives .
the present report by mr oostlander has been long awaited , not only by us .
these countries are looking hopefully towards a future in the european union .
in this report we are giving a political signal , telling them that we await them in the strasbourg family .
but until then there is much to be done by all sides .
i thank mr oostlander , who devoted particular attention to the situation of women in central and eastern europe and adopted the main points from the opinion delivered by the committee on women 's rights .
these women need to know what they can expect from membership of the european union .
they also have to be sure that joint efforts will be undertaken to promote employment and education as well as social and health services for women and girls .
efforts must be made from the very outset to ensure that women are not economically and socially marginalized .
in eastern and central europe many women are trained for technical occupations and are to be found in far greater numbers in the realms of science and research than is the case in western europe , for example .
let us ensure that they can assume an increasing amount of political responsibility and can thus effectively play an active part in helping to shape life in the european union .
let us support the young democracies by means of reliable partnership and clear messages .
madam president , i shall restrict myself to two points after congratulating mr oostlander on his fine , factual , in-depth report .
the two points i want to make are as follows .
first of all everyone will agree that it is extremely important that we increasingly adopt a pan-european approach to transport .
we see the trouble in our part of europe caused by not managing to set up a proper transport policy in the european union .
there we hope , together with the relevant authorities from the eastern european countries , to shape the pan-european transport policy .
the second point i wish to highlight is the area of tension on the requirements necessary for vehicles from eastern european countries operating on our markets .
we all know how important it is to reduce the environmental pollution from traffic .
we lay down stringent requirements on vehicles stationed in western europe .
we now see an increasing number of vehicles from eastern europe which do not come anywhere near meeting these same requirements operating on our road network .
i would appreciate hearing what the commissioner has to say on this area of tension .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , back in the summer of 1993 the european council decided that those countries of central and eastern europe which wanted to join the european union could do so .
the european council set out the conditions , and quite tough conditions they are too .
the obstacle to accession is not insurmountable , but it is very high .
president dini stated this morning that preparations for enlargement are also on the agenda of the intergovernmental conference .
he said that the agenda was ambitious and kaleidoscopic , that the council will present an interim report and that the madrid decisions are to be implemented .
those are clear words .
the european union provided help .
in short , the european union has made a decisive contribution .
but the really strenuous efforts to date have been made by the governments and more especially by the people in the countries of central and eastern europe themselves .
moreover , they have no influence over the essential reform measures that we still have to adopt within the community , for example in the domains of finance and agriculture .
the countries of central and eastern europe , however , are not deterred by this , nor should we in the european parliament be deterred by the magnitude of the tasks facing us .
we want to modernize the european union .
we want to guarantee stability in europe , both now and in the long term .
we know that this will not be free of charge , but the cost of non-accession , the cost of instability in europe and the cost of separate development would be far , far higher .
the future accession of the countries of central and eastern europe to the european union is no reason for euphoria and certainly not for arrogance .
the future enlargement of the european union gives us no cause for excessive optimism , but neither should it cause us undue alarm .
we must set about our task of creating the new europe of the twentieth century realistically , critically and confidently .
the forthcoming enlargement is part of that task .
our europe will become what we ourselves make of it .
i have spent considerable time in central europe since the revolutions and i believe that we owe our fellow-europeans the courtesy of the truth .
enlargement is not only necessary , it is urgent .
we can help that process by the raft of programmes we already have in place but , most notably , we can help by training their civil servants .
we can hinder that process by failing to put our own house in order over the common agricultural policy and over budget reform .
above all we can hinder that process by a failure of imagination and by self-absorption .
the financial aspects of enlargement will not be clear for some time yet .
they will depend on the sequence and on the timing of that enlargement and on the progress of the cap reform .
this is no time for bean counting , it is a time for clarity of intent and honesty of purpose .
madam president , this debate has assumed a historical dimension , since it is a case of finally turning over one of the darkest pages in our european past .
the countries of central and eastern europe are european countries .
we all share the same values and heritage .
however , 50 years ago they were torn away from europe and forced into a geopolitical entity where they have never felt at home .
for these countries , the european union has always been an ideal , because in their eyes , it represents a success in three areas : democracy , security and prosperity .
furthermore , the european union has grown larger and more complex and cannot admit new countries without taking substantial precautions to ensure that its cohesion is not weakened .
but if we speed up the process , we run a serious risk of causing them to miss their opportunity .
that is why it is important for us to do our best to prepare them for accession .
there are three conditions to be met .
first of all , these countries must share our aims and values .
they must accede in the hope of sharing not only in our prosperity , but in everything that gives meaning to europe , above all democracy .
cooperation on a regional level will accustom them to this .
finally , it is understandable that having had their independence suppressed for 50 years , national security is of great concern to these countries .
as things are at present , nato represents , in their eyes , the kind of security structure that meets their needs .
countries which have emerged from the communist bloc must be able to choose freely the type of security structures they wish to have .
to appease russia , not by giving in to its demands , but through an exhaustive dialogue , is a crucial element in the process of enlargement .
mr oostlander 's report sets out very clearly the information on preparing for enlargement , and for this reason , my group will give it its support .
in this resolution parliament rallies behind the view of the commission and the council .
the commission must present its opinions on all the applicant countries soon after the igc negotiations .
the applicant countries should be treated on an equal footing and the complete acceptance of the ' acquis communautaire ' should be central to the negotiations .
the commission 's white paper is a very useful tool in this exercise .
the preparations in the individual countries will determine the time of accession .
the consensus between the institutions on the procedure to be followed will enable an accession which has been well prepared .
of course it will cost money , and if you are thinking of costs then i am sure that it will cost more the longer we fail to implement what we have decided .
i could not agree more with mr spencer .
there is a lot to be done in economic terms for the central and eastern european countries .
with a little help from the european union they will be able to make it .
for this adaptation process they have no need of tons of white papers but concrete aid .
once the adaptation process has been completed they will be ready to accede .
madam president , like the rapporteur , we are in principle in favour of enlargement to include the countries of central and eastern europe , since we believe that a united europe is inconceivable without their participation .
nevertheless , widening must be accompanied by deepening - in order to prevent the european union from becoming a mere free-trade area - and progress towards political union , with the introduction of the essential institutional reforms .
if there is something which we must export to those countries , it is not all-out economic liberalism , but the european social model .
consequently , there is a need to ensure the preservation of policies such as the cap - albeit reformed - and the structural funds .
we do not wish to see agricultural policies returned to national control , or appropriations for the structural funds remaining unaltered , with the same amount of money being distributed between a greater number of countries .
in the political field , we must support the deepening of democracy and the defence of human rights .
and as regards security , accession to the european union must not be automatically linked to accession to nato .
that is not the way to guarantee the security of the countries of central and eastern europe .
the way to do that is to create a genuine european security and defence identity , based on new foundations and adapted to the current situation .
we are therefore in favour of enlargement .
this report represents a contribution - albeit an inadequate one - to that process .
we in the green group see eastward enlargement as the current political goal of the european union .
enormous historical importance attaches to it .
it could become one of the main prerequisites of a peaceful and democratic europe .
the countries of eastern europe in particular entertain high hopes of early accession .
after all , it is not only the countries of central and eastern europe that have to prepare to move in step with the european union .
it would be wrong to try and solve the european union 's own structural problems by extending its market eastwards .
how are these countries to develop the ecological and social aspects of their economies if the so-called conditions of accession are based on an export-orientated development process ?
this would resolve neither the social nor the democratic conflicts in those countries .
expecting the countries of central and eastern europe to embrace the principles of the common agricultural policy is a step in the wrong direction .
if they pursue such a policy , they will be faced with a huge employment crisis .
those countries are neither prepared for such a crisis nor able to overcome it .
the european union has no option but to prepare for this enlargement by reforming its structural and agricultural policies .
i also believe it is wrong to seek to develop a common security policy without preventive mechanisms and without the osce .
this is a major flaw in the oostlander report .
madam president , the white paper on which this report is based deals with a vast but well-defined subject : preparing the associated countries of central and eastern europe for integration into the union 's internal market .
mr oostlander , whom i congratulate on the quality of his work , has decided to extend the scope of his report .
he has presented us with an overall political picture of enlargement , the reasons behind it , its effects , and the conditions which have to be fulfilled in order for enlargement to be successful .
the 15 opinions of the specialist committees have enabled us to cover a wide spectrum of issues .
in general , i am in favour of mr oostlander 's report .
it is constructive , positive and does not discriminate between the associated countries of central and eastern europe , all of whom are starting out from the same point .
however , it could perhaps have placed more emphasis on the considerable opportunity which enlargement represents for ourselves .
but i would earnestly ask that mentioning pre-conditions should not make people think that we are , in fact , in no hurry to throw our doors open to new residents .
only then will they be able to summon up the energy needed to justify the tremendous effort that is and will continue to be required from their people .
just think of the progress already made : for example , a 7 % annual increase in gnp in both poland and the czech republic .
political action thrives on goals , hope , and even dreams .
for those of a more serious or technical turn of mind , there is the white paper itself .
the commission has carried out an excellent piece of work , which is already proving useful in planning the reforms that are being carried out in the countries of central and eastern europe .
i was in poland recently and can confirm this .
naturally , this white paper on the internal market will be supplemented by others .
this subsequent work will allow progress to be assessed , but above all it will encourage the efforts made by the applicant countries , as well as ourselves .
nobody puts a question mark against the white paper 's and the report 's principal political objective : peace and stability in europe .
but the question is whether the means to achieve this are the right ones .
the keyword is adaptation , which actually means , in practice , submission .
there are political conditions attached to our neighbours ' access to our markets , and these political conditions are based on the obsessive notion that social , political and legal problems are solved by means of strengthened supranational mechanisms .
it is a tragic mistake , not made any better by the report 's highflown language which includes an innovation called the social market economy .
i will admit that social market economy is linguistically creative , but unfortunately politically impossible .
madam president , in the report on the accession of the countries of central and eastern europe to the european union , i was particularly struck by the constant references to democracy and human rights .
i was also struck by the report 's obsession with economics , when what europe needs is political will .
it is up to us , in company with our comrades in the east , to seek a third way , one far removed from socialism as well as capitalism , both of which generate poverty and social injustice .
madam president , we should not lose sight of what the oostlander report is all about : it is a response to the commission 's white paper and it is not parliament 's definitive decision on enlargement .
we should make that clear to everyone .
the committee on budgets did not submit any amendments to the report for the simple reason that we are awaiting the outcome of a public hearing next month on the cost of enlargement .
we would have much preferred that the oostlander report waited until after that hearing or , indeed , that the hearing be brought forward .
i think that is to some extent a condemnation of the timetabling of parliament 's business .
but here we are , we are left with the report , and the fact that the budgets committee has not yet had its hearing .
i do not take exception to what tom spencer said : i take it as a compliment when i am criticized in this respect .
but tom said something about the budgets committee wanting to spoil this report because it is involved in bean counting .
one of the questions we have to ask , quite frankly , is how many beans are the member states prepared to pay for enlargement ?
until we get an answer to that , we can pontificate as much as we want about enlargement and will be giving a false impression until we know the cost .
parliament 's position on enlargement deserves something far better than a report of this kind .
at least it deserves a committee in its own right , as we had with east german accession .
we should not be giving those applicant countries false hope until we know the cost .
madam president , the council has decided that the european union is to be enlarged to include the states of central and eastern europe , and the european parliament supports that decision .
it represents both a historic challenge and an opportunity for all concerned .
for the first time , the states within the boundaries of europe can become a community devoted to peace .
the closer we come to this step , however , the more discussion there will be of the details of enlargement .
the white paper is a compendium of rules governing the working of the european internal market , and in the event of accession the candidates will also have to base their policies on the white paper .
so that proper preparation can take place and excessive expectations and misleading arguments can be avoided , this subject must be systematically and seriously discussed in all its aspects .
it is clear , and has often been said , that while the european union has to move , so too must the candidate states .
this report by mr oostlander can only be the starting-point for a thorough discussion .
as a budget expert , i should like to add that the committee on budgets , as barry wynn pointed out , will contribute to a wide-ranging discussion of this matter .
on 7 may the committee will stage a hearing on the financial aspects of enlarging the european union , which will culminate in the use of its right of initiative to table a report .
both the oostlander report and the christodoulou report on the financial aspects of enlargement are intended as a signal to the council to institute concrete measures at the igc and thereafter with regard to the forthcoming enlargement .
they are also meant to demonstrate that parliament has already begun its work towards this end and intends to pursue it resolutely .
madam president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for his report which can at least be called comprehensive .
it tackles many aspects of enlargement of the union , including the budget , education , social affairs , the second and third pillars .
but in my view the commission 's white paper is not about that .
the white paper is about preparing the central and eastern european countries for their integration into the union 's internal market .
but our proposals are important for the integration of applicant countries into the union 's internal market .
among other things they include the tremendous legislative task facing the countries of central and eastern europe to adapt their national legislation to the internal market .
the central and eastern european countries must be encouraged and motivated into accepting the temporary high costs of this because this adaption is needed for the major paneuropean market of the future .
it goes without saying that we shall have to help them in this process .
the principles of competition must be respected in the central and eastern european countries and the criteria for granting public aid must be harmonised .
madam president , there is no doubt that enlargement is being promoted by the dominant powers in the european union , for ideological and geopolitical reasons .
i think today 's debate proves that the european parliament too subscribes to that kind of thinking .
how can our peoples pretend to adopt that policy when its consequences for their countries and for themselves are unknown ?
i do not think that anyone gives us the right to teach democracy to any of europe 's peoples .
democracy and social integration are the concerns of all peoples , and from that point of view i think we ought to act with reserve and be careful about how we approach the countries of eastern and central europe .
madam president , the enlargement of the european union towards the east is written in the stars , and is therefore as inevitable as it is inviolable .
this is a fact of life which no member state can deny .
nevertheless , the negotiations which will begin after the intergovernmental conference must concentrate on establishing the conditions that are required to make integration a politically constructive process .
however , according to present studies , it would not be in the interests of either the applicant countries or ourselves if accession were to take place before 2005 .
hungary , poland , the czech republic and slovenia have all made tremendous efforts in order to join the union .
we must not deceive them , and must therefore show , without resorting to either populism or paternalism , that we have the political will to include them among our number .
quite simply , opening up towards the east is the wind of change that many liberal governments are hoping will flatten for good the still fragile house of cards of genuine political and social union .
that is the challenge which is facing us .
i believe , and i shall focus my speech today on this , that in addition to the economic and political aspects security must also play a major part in the debate on enlargement .
so mr oostlander is quite right in his report to say that the enlargement of the union will require an adjustment of european security structures .
in the first place we shall have to study the place of future eu member states within the western european union and nato . as far as i am concerned these countries are welcome there in principle .
but nobody can deny that the enlargement of nato in particular will meet with strong resistance from the russian federation .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i too would like to commend mr oostlander on his excellent in-depth report .
however , i cannot conceal a slight feeling of dissatisfaction which it is beyond the power of mr oostlander alone to overcome .
this is a great pity , since our work needs such a perspective .
we are taking part in a historic adventure .
the 15 present member states of the union have practically all waged war on each other during the course of the last seven or eight centuries .
the arrival on the scene of other nations provides a chance for reconciliation in a continent that has experienced more wars than almost any other .
furthermore , history contains no case of a great power that has been forged other than by conquering its future vassal states .
i would also stress that the final choice of dates does not lie with the european parliament , but with the intergovernmental conference .
i do not think it would be wise to take any risks , however small , in this respect .
we ask you to heed our message , commissioner .
since we have listed figures , doubts , uncertainties , and conditions , we should also mention motives , which could turn out to be noble and generous .
we are embarking on the greatest political adventure that mankind has ever witnessed .
madam president , as a long-time student of the enlargement question , i must confess to being slightly bemused by the debate going on about this particular round of enlargement .
we started off a couple of years ago with everybody saying ' oh , we must enlarge ' , talking very glibly about it as if it was about members joining some sort of social club .
i found myself warning that it was not as simple as that .
but we have now got ourselves into a position where everybody is throwing up their arms in horror at the enormous difficulties , and that is before we have even started the negotiations .
i find myself having to play down those difficulties .
as the last speaker on behalf of parliament i ought to reiterate some basic points .
firstly , it is not a question of if we enlarge , it is a question of when we enlarge .
the european union is open to any state which meets the basic criteria .
in addition , to the central and eastern european countries we have long said that if they threw off the yoke of dictatorship we would welcome them into our family .
if we reverse that message now we run the risk of undermining all the reforms which have taken place at great pain in central and eastern europe .
we also run the risk of seeing a descent into the sort of ethnic tension we have been horrified by in yugoslavia .
we also run the risk , as mr wiersma has said , of undermining the security of the continent .
that said , of course , we have to acknowledge that there are major difficulties which need to be addressed in the years to come , particularly in agriculture and the regional fund and in the decision-making structure .
to underestimate those difficulties would be ultimately to undermine the enlargement process .
an overhasty enlargement would actually do more harm than good .
we cannot pretend that these problems do not exist .
we cannot constantly be operating under the tyranny of the committee on budgets in the european parliament .
i welcome the white paper because it is a start in addressing the practical issues in relation to enlargement .
at the end of the day enlargement is a political question , it is a question of political will by political leaders .
do we want to make it happen ?
there is also a question of political acceptability to the citizens of the european union and to the citizens of the central and eastern european countries .
unless they are prepared to accept the conditions we negotiate , it will not happen .
we should bear that in mind in everything we say and do leading up to ultimate enlargement in the next century .
madam president , i have listened with great interest and fascination this morning to the many members who have spoken on this highly important subject of the enlargement of the european union .
may i first of all congratulate the rapporteur , mr oostlander , on his comprehensive report and the great deal of work he has put into it .
i know that he consulted many other parliamentary committees in order to product a well balanced text and we ourselves had the pleasure of discussing the subject with him on several occasions .
it is a historic opportunity , a point which has been made several times this morning .
we ought to seize this opportunity , which is not easy at times , but the political decision taken at the european council in copenhagen in 1993 was clear .
the member states decided to further in this way the political , economic and social development of all peoples in europe .
in that decision security policy played a determining role .
a successful intergovernmental conference is in the view of the commission essential for enlargement .
we in the commission know that parliament agrees with us here .
mr oostlander 's report also makes this quite clear .
you will recall the promise given to you by the council during the last enlargement .
the european council in madrid in december proclaimed a new phase in the process of enlargement of the union and was challenged to define the procedure and the timetable for its preparation .
the commission was instructed to produce a report on certain aspects of enlargement . it has to further evaluate the consequences of enlargement on community policy , with particular reference to agriculture and structural policy .
the european council will resume its examination on the basis of these reports .
the commission services continue to analyze the consequences of enlargement on the union 's policy as well as the situation in each of the applicant countries .
these opinions will be accompanied by a so-called synthesis document in which the main horizontal questions relevant to the enlargement and the prospect of accession negotiations will be addressed .
the commission will then produce a statement on the financial framework , after 1999 , which takes account of the possible enlargement .
the council will then decide on the start of accession negotiations in the light of all these reports .
with regard to cyprus and malta , as you know , the decision was taken to start negotiations six months after the conclusion of the igc .
but definitive decisions have yet to be taken .
that is the situation at the moment and i intend , and the commission intends , to involve the european parliament as closely as possible in this process .
it is only by working in harmony with the other institutions that this ambitious task can be done .
we need your help and advice and this report from mr oostlander forms a good point of departure .
more specifically with regard to the implementation of the white paper considerable progress has been made with preparing the associated countries to integrate into the internal market .
they have worked out new national strategies to adapt to the legislation of the internal market or are in the process of doing so in close cooperation with the commission .
this service will soon be expanded to include experts in the field of the internal market from national administrations and from private bodies in the member states .
i shall now turn briefly to the specific paragraphs of the motion for a resolution .
we fully support the broad outlines of the motion for a resolution .
paragraph 1 calls the enlargement of the european union to include the countries of central and eastern europe a momentous opportunity to contribute to peace , security and prosperity throughout europe .
that is the commission 's starting point for its future activities .
in paragraph 4 the council and the member states at the igc are urged to do everything in their power to reform the institutions of the european union to enable the eu to operate more effectively .
as i have already said , the commission totally endorses that view .
in various paragraphs you call for more white papers to be presented on various subjects .
i would , however , point out that pursuant to the european council in madrid the commission has been instructed to present various reports .
in addition to the detailed opinions on the applications for accession the commission will also produce a synthesis document on the enlargement .
i have already mentioned that .
so the commission has already a large number of reports to work on .
secondly , the existence of a functioning market economy and thirdly the ability to withstand the pressure of competition and market forces within the union .
we believe that clearly describes the criteria .
this important debate will undoubtedly be followed by many more .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place in a moment .
votes
before this roll-call vote is held , i should simply like to point out that the amendment relates only to the figures .
rejecting it would therefore amount to contesting the figures , which at present are not in dispute .
after the vote on the amendments :
mr president , ladies and gentlemen .
what we therefore want is referral back to committee to have the strategic debate on it there because it has not been properly debated yet .
we believe it extremely important that parliament give itself time to examine whether the consequences of this decision will be what we want , namely budgetisation , so that we create a clear structural situation .
we are calling for more time for a strategic debate and hence for referral back to committee .
i thank those members who are applauding in advance what i am about to say .
i should like to say to mrs aelvoet that , despite the fact that we are on opposite sides of the house , i fully support her proposal for referral back to committee .
i do not agree with her when she calls for the european development fund to be integrated into the general budget , since that would mean that the acp countries would receive less money .
i do agree with her , however , when she says that the debate was not conducted properly and that we are sending a bad signal to the acp countries .
it is not the question of the integration of the edf into the budget or otherwise which determines our rejection of this report , but the fact that we are sending a bad signal to the acp countries .
to refuse the discharge would be to call into question our cooperation with those countries and our will to continue that cooperation .
it would be to exploit the issue of budgetizing the edf , through an institutional ploy which we reject , to the detriment of our relations with the acp countries .
i am therefore in favour of referring the report back to committee .
mr president , the proposal to refer this back to committee is totally inappropriate , particularly for the reasons given .
it was a perfectly proper debate .
i can think of no circumstances less appropriate to refer a matter back to the committee .
this house should reject this proposal .
( applause )
( parliament rejected the proposal to refer the matter back to committee )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , on a point of order , i should like to move an amendment to the order of voting .
in the voting list the amendment i am tabling on behalf of the group of the european people 's party comes before the amendment tabled by the green group in the european parliament .
the greens ' amendment , however , goes further .
both amendments concern research with foetal tissue .
the greens reject such research outright .
good reasons may be found for that , but it does not reflect the view expressed by parliament in other resolutions .
i believe we can then carry this amendment no 3 together , because parliament has already adopted it once .
but let me add that some groups would like a separate vote on the passage concerning somatic gene therapy at the end of amendment no 3 .
if it is still possible , i should like to ask for that to be arranged , but the more important point to me is the voting sequence .
mr liese , i cannot agree with you .
the order in which the secretariat has prepared the vote is the logical and correct order .
mr president , you certainly answered my point very clearly and assuredly .
i should just like to know what makes you so sure that a total ban on research in a particular field is less far-reaching than the subjection of such research to certain safety regulations .
at any rate , i stand by my opinion and call for the vote to be taken first on the amendment tabled by the green group in the european parliament and then on our amendment .
it is not for the chair to judge these things .
all we are doing in terms of setting the structure for the vote is to follow the logical , chronological order of the amendments .
the house is sovereign in terms of the decisions it makes .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , this is a very minor amendment .
i understand it has fairly wide-spread support across the house .
i should just like to read the first line : ' notes in this respect that measures to promote employment should ...
' .
after the word ' should ' we would like to insert the word ' also ' so that it would then read : ' ...
should also be developed by the member states , the regions and local communities and especially by the social partners .
( the oral amendment was accepted )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before we take the final vote i should like to thank the rapporteur for making my job in the chair easier than it could have been .
it was a very complicated vote .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , i ask your indulgence to invite my colleagues who have not yet signed the declaration on autism to do so .
over 100 colleagues have signed it in the last two days .
i wish to invite the rest to sign it as soon as possible .
under the rules , you cannot so inform the house but you have anyway .
parliament 's decision is fully in keeping with the conclusions of the barcelona conference .
it is time to restore balance to the european union 's cooperation with its partners on the other shores of the mediterranean .
furthermore , with regard to the fisheries sector , we must welcome the financial protocol annexed to the agreement , which amounts to ecu 500 million over four years .
i personally support the breakdown between four actions : financial compensation , development programmes , scientific research and training programmes .
the aid granted must serve to promote employment and development .
the european union is showing solidarity in an important sector of the moroccan economy .
this solidarity must also be displayed in other sectors .
a vote in favour is virtually certain , but we shall have to wait a few months before giving a boost to renewed general cooperation .
we voted in favour , because this is a good agreement , which is the outcome of sound negotiations and an excellent result for relations between the european union and morocco .
that has been achieved .
who could possibly object to better coordination in health policy ?
yet we voted against the proposal and did so for the following reasons .
it is obvious that collecting data serves a wider purpose than merely evaluating the present community policy .
the background is the continuing harmonisation of the health systems themselves .
that goal is now just a step too far .
if these systems grow towards each other , then that is all very well .
but if brussels deliberately dictates that path , then that is an undesirable development in our view .
mr president , for some years now the european union has had a number of public health programmes in an attempt to bring europe closer to the man in the street .
even european programmes to combat cancer , aids and smoking have difficulty resisting the test of subsidiarity .
subsidising national programmes is basically nothing other than recycling money .
money which is first of all transferred to the union and then after a lengthy process of project selection is finally returned to base .
the value of a european approach is in serious doubt .
the problem facing a policy on public health in many countries is the inability to pay for care .
costs have soared through the roof .
but the question of how much money should be paid for health care should be answered by the people involved . it is a national affair .
commissioners and members of the european parliament have no business saying anything here .
if the national authorities can hardly come to grips with it then nothing will be gained by tackling it on a wider scale .
europe should not get over ambitious by trying to manage public health policy .
even the very definition of a hospital bed creates problems .
a european monitoring system is out of the question .
in my opinion the development of a worthwhile european policy on public health is a dream .
let europe concentrate its forces on other affairs .
this is what is proposed in the commission 's document , which the rapporteur has skilfully amended .
the fundamental choices which the member states will be obliged to make are important and will have a bearing on the future of the european project itself .
the european parliament had intended to propose the establishment of a genuine european health observatory , along the lines of those being set up in other fields .
however , the majority in the council preferred to restrict the programme to one of simple coordination - exploiting , as usual , the different traditions and reservations of the health sector and the budgetary constraints in this area .
the outline of the health monitoring system proposed by the commission is certainly somewhat blurred , but whatever form this new instrument takes , we wish it to be practicable and effective .
the european parliament also wished , in general terms , health professionals , ngos and the paramedical sector as a whole to be more closely associated with the definition of the broad outlines of health policy .
i am not entirely convinced that this wish was taken into account by the commission .
it is time , therefore , to ensure the involvement of the citizens and health professionals in the taking of tomorrow 's major decisions .
in the commission 's own terms , the proposed health monitoring system is designed to :
as long as the data provided is harmonized , this will make it easier to compare information and adjust national health policies . '
i repeat : medicine in the twenty-first century must be more resolutely focused on prevention .
we have much to gain from this , and let us make no mistake : a well-managed prevention policy will enable us to safeguard the integrity of our endangered healthcare systems .
by spending in advance , we spend less later on .
if operations were carried out as soon as the warning signs appeared , there would be fewer deaths and tragedies .
i hope that this commission proposal - even if i do not believe that it is as accomplished as the house would have wished - will constitute a first step towards establishing this medicine of tomorrow .
leopardi report ( a4-0091 / 96 )
the creation of a european health card , as repeatedly called for by the european parliament , will represent a step in this direction , and we therefore wish to congratulate mr leopardi on his report .
once again , we add our voice to this positive request .
furthermore , the national health cards are subject to the standards and criteria governing information / registration applicable in the member state in question , which restricts the scope for misusing information .
moreover , the report is an example of the numerous own-initiative reports from the ep in the health sector , which have no overall strategic basis , and cut down the time available for actual legislative work .
these are the reasons for which i voted in favour of this report .
the idea is simple : to enable european citizens travelling around europe to have on their person , at all times , the information on their state of health allowing them to be treated properly , wherever they are .
this would represent a genuine step forward in making the daily lives of our citizens easier .
this idea has been on the table since 1981 , and parliament has adopted a number of resolutions on the subject .
now , pursuant to article 138b of the ec treaty , it can request the submission of a corresponding legislative proposal .
mr leopardi 's report indicates that the legal basis would be article 129 on health policy , whereby the european union may encourage and coordinate the member states ' actions in the sphere of public health .
two issues , in my view , are particularly important .
the first concerns respect for the confidentiality of the information contained on the cards , and the confidence that citizens can place in the competent authorities wherever they go .
and the second concerns acceptance of the card throughout europe .
this will inevitably be a long-term enterprise , especially in that it involves an area where the community 's competence is limited .
it is not the view of the danish social democrats that the eu should pursue an actual health policy .
the drawing up of health policies should continue to be a task carried out as closely as possible to the citizen , with the public exercising the maximum influence .
there are widely differing views in the eu on the basic principles of health policy , and the best method of ensuring quality for the individual is therefore through a decentralised health policy .
mr leopardi 's report on a health card would require resources which cannot be justified by the card 's potential use .
the card would have to be used throughout the health system , which would require the procurement of electronic equipment and the electronic input of data .
a number of people would have this card issued individually , and there would have to be training on a massive scale in the use of cards and equipment .
in addition there are the running costs , altogether a very costly business .
the advantages are not so great as they appear to be at first sight .
practical , security and ethical problems , together with the fact that only europe is covered , restrict the scope for its use .
on the basis of a medical technology assessment , this report would inevitably be rejected .
the report should in other respects be viewed in the context of many mps ' wish for a federal health policy , in which health costs are covered by the eu .
however , there are also very positive aspects to the proposal , including easier access to treatment abroad , but significantly better provision can be made for those aspects in other ways .
the popular movement cannot vote in favour of this report , in that we consider it to be far too narrowly conceived .
if a form of health card is to be devised , then it should extend far further than the eu 's borders , and we would like to see something established at the wto level for example .
we also see a danger in adopting an eu health card since we fear that it will be a step towards further integration and finally lead to a common eu health policy .
we do not want that .
the individual member states should continue to be able to pursue an independent health policy .
we find that a health card containing information about sexual orientation , for example , is quite unacceptable . and we also believe that it should be voluntary to have a health card or not .
in conclusion , we would add that experience should always be exchanged both within and outside the european union , but we are opposed to monitoring systems of any kind , including any in the health sector .
wynn report ( a4-0098 / 96 )
mr president , our group did not vote in favour of mr wynn 's report granting the commission discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget for 1994 .
i should first like to make some remarks concerning the procedure .
as i pointed out yesterday in the general debate , eight separate reports were the subject of a joint debate .
taking into account the breaks in the sitting , this debate lasted less than two hours .
there were very few contributors other than the main speakers from the committee on budgets .
consequently , the debate received little input , and today very little time was devoted to the votes .
i note that no amendments were tabled .
so there will be virtually no explanations of vote on this subject .
this is revealing , in my view , of a negative trend which i must condemn .
in view of the fact that the committee on budgets is failing to assume its responsibilities , therefore , we voted against the wynn report .
wynn report ( a4-0096 / 96 )
mr president , i had the opportunity to express my views on the discharge yesterday , and once again , a little while ago , in connection with mrs aelvoet 's proposal for referral back to committee .
and i would point out that the foundation 's spending - ecu 810 000 , or 0.04 % of the edf - was the pretext used for refusing the discharge .
that is the only irregularity .
and i accept that it is an irregularity .
are the disastrous political consequences of a negative decision on the edf 's accounts not likely to undermine the acp countries ' confidence in the member states ' commitment towards them ?
the institutional ploy in which the majority of members are engaging is unacceptable . it discredits this parliament .
we cannot use a report , regardless of its substance , as a pretext for engaging in deliberations on structural or institutional problems .
we did this with regard to loans to south africa .
now we are doing it again with regard to cooperation with the acp countries .
our group refuses to participate in this institutional ploy , this continuing squabble .
it is for this reason that it did not vote in favour of mr wynn 's report .
there is no real democratic control over the utilization of the european development fund , whilst in the member states , development aid expenditure is controlled by the national parliaments .
this is an area in which the usefulness of pursuing policies jointly under a community procedure has not been demonstrated .
the undersigned agree with the court of auditors ' criticisms of the shortcomings of the european development fund 's management and the minimal scrutiny to which the fund 's payments are subject .
we are also critical of the lack of logic in the legal and juridical framework governing the edf .
however , unlike the report we do not believe that parliament should be given increased budgetary or legislative powers .
the edf should continue to be managed by the member states and audited by nationally appointed auditors .
discharge should be granted by the national parliaments , which are the bodies with most democratic legitimacy .
the are group 's decision to vote against granting the commission discharge in respect of the implementation of the european development funds for the 1994 financial year is based on the following two reasons :
this is hardly reassuring . in fact , waste is inherent in a community budgetary procedure that is characterized by irresponsibility .
firstly , there is the irresponsibility due to the financial structure . europe is a suction and force pump .
80 % of expenditure is managed by the member states . in these circumstances , does it make sense for it to pass through brussels ?
should the subsidiarity principle not lead to part of community expenditure being relinquished ?
secondly , there is the irresponsibility due to the political structure . the cohesion fund , the structural funds and certain internal policies are designed to create a support base for the european community .
but creating support bases and budgetary discipline are , by their very nature , mutually exclusive .
this should lead to a revision of the financial perspective : not upwards - towards ever increasing expenditure and taxation - but , on the contrary , downwards - towards a drastic reduction of expenditure and revenue .
poggiolini report ( a4-0051 / 96 )
we are all aware that the population of the european union is living longer and ageing .
we must welcome this phenomenon , which is proof of the constant improvement of living and hygiene conditions .
nevertheless , we must also prepare for its many consequences .
the increase in lifespan is leading to a rise in the incidence of age-related diseases - in particular , alzheimer 's disease .
we cannot ignore the fact that by the year 2000 , around 8 million european citizens will be affected .
the consequences of this irreversible degenerative disease are above all human .
the progressive alienation and physical decline of an elderly person cause immense suffering to both the patient and his or her family and carers .
given the extent of alzheimer 's disease , however , the amount of financial resources and medical staff devoted to tackling it are totally inadequate .
i unreservedly support the rapporteur 's call on the commission to implement a programme of measures to combat this disease .
similarly , i would urge the commission to draw up , in collaboration with the member states , a white paper on the different approaches to alzheimer 's disease in the european union .
let us enrich our collective knowledge with the experiences of the different member states .
let us join our efforts to establish the specific causes of this disease .
failing to spend sufficient money on research into the disease is bound to mean having to spend more money on dealing with its consequences .
in addition to this essential but futile humanitarian expenditure , therefore , let us make a positive investment in eradicating this scourge - god willing - once and for all .
naturally , all this will require adequate financial resources to be provided , with a view to enabling coherent action to be taken to combat this disease .
in voting against the report on alzheimer 's disease , i am expressing dissatisfaction with the lack of an overall strategy within the health sector for rare diseases and , with it , european cooperation on these illnesses .
the fact that an own-initiative report has been drawn up on alzheimer 's disease is not wrong in itself , but why this disease in particular ?
what about all the other rare diseases where there is a need for greater research ?
it would have been a better idea in the first place to have devised a common strategy for rare diseases and , in that context , discuss the priorities for community action .
the incidence of alzheimer 's disease in advanced countries , where it is mainly concentrated , is already high .
the absolute number of victims is already considerable and comparable with that of other virus diseases , such as aids .
could this be mainly because it is believed that alzheimer 's disease affects mainly the aged ?
so far there have only been research programmes of limited scope , while the financing of those programmes falls far short of the associated scientific and social interest .
' senile dementia ' , as it is known , is not the target of a single expenditure programme by the welfare organizations .
however , in the immediate future , finance must also be provided for research on the prevention , diagnosis and treatment of the disease .
cabrol report ( a4-0094 / 96 )
ladies and gentlemen , what a long way we have come !
we can finally dare to talk of carrying out tests and telling infected donors not to give any more blood - although you would think that was the least that should be done .
we can finally dare to talk about promoting the use of self-transfusion , something which until very recently was prohibited , for reasons which in fact were far more ideological than practical .
our reasoned words were met with nothing but scorn .
today , those who contradicted us stand accused of the infamous charge of contaminating the population .
i have already had an opportunity - yesterday evening , in plenary - to express my support for the commission communication and mr cabrol 's report .
today , i wish to reiterate the importance of ensuring the safety of blood products through the testing of donations and the application of stringent circulation and storage requirements .
i also wish to stress the need for a large-scale information and awareness campaign on blood and blood donation , with a view to achieving self-sufficiency in europe .
may we never forget the tragedy of all those recipients of transfusions who were infected for want of adequate tests and safety measures - even if the information on aids available at the time was inadequate .
that must serve as a lesson for the future and prompt us to introduce even more stringent safety requirements .
i have chosen to vote against the report on safety in the blood sector and self-sufficiency in blood , because i see no special grounds why the community should be self-sufficient in blood .
this debate on the safety of transfusions and self-sufficiency in blood and blood products raises an important social issue .
a choice must be made between the defence of moral principles and the pursuit of profit .
the house was able to highlight these dangers during a special debate in september 1993 .
the commission was required to take account of parliament 's concerns in its communication of december 1994 , which is the subject of this report .
our group 's position is based on an inviolable basic principle : that the human body is not a commodity .
we believe that the human body and any organs or substances obtained from it are inalienable and non-marketable .
our position coincides with that outlined in the report by the committee on the environment - a report which we are all the more happy to support now that it has been improved and strengthened by our amendments .
voluntary blood donor associations have long been pressing the commission to take action in this important area of public health .
these associations have always stressed the need for blood donations to be voluntary and unpaid .
this , their basic principle , is designed to guarantee both self-sufficiency and absolute safety in the supply and use of blood and blood products .
it is the trade in blood and the pursuit of profit which threaten to introduce the risk of contamination , through inadequate or lax controls and failure to comply with rules and time limits throughout the transfusion chain .
let me say that thanks to the effective action taken by the luxembourg red cross and voluntary blood donor associations , luxembourg has managed to ensure both self-sufficiency and absolute compliance with all safety and hygiene requirements .
blood , and the products obtained and extracted from it , are extremely important therapeutic substances by means of which medical science offers substantial help in both acute and chronic diseases .
the methods used up till now must be re-examined as responsibly and sensitively as possible , as well as the rules relating to the system of blood donation and its safe therapeutic use in patients .
current regulations involve omissions and inadequacies that are responsible for the results of the practices in force for the production and disposal of blood products .
the development of voluntary blood donation must be the most important contribution to covering the demand for blood used to cater for the therapeutic needs of patients .
however , that source must go together with reliable and responsible clinical and laboratory support .
liaison and cooperation between the relevant services in the member states must be facilitated , to guarantee coordinated action in the context of the therapeutic use of blood and the avoidance of disease transmission by biological factors .
we cannot legislate to ensure ethical conduct .
turin european council
widening must therefore be reconciled with deepening - but how will this be possible whilst respecting the fundamental principle of maintaining a single institutional framework ?
in these circumstances , we are not surprised to find , in the summary of the european council 's conclusions , a lack of any clear vision of europe 's future .
will the intergovernmental conference succeed in reconciling these two conflicting demands ?
however , the igc is burdened with an even more serious problem : that of the single currency .
officially , the conference is not meant to be addressing this issue , since the decision has already been taken .
in reality , however , the preparations for the single currency are bringing to light a number of serious institutional problems which remain to be resolved .
mr h&auml;nsch himself drew attention to this in his speech at the turin summit .
i shall quote him : ' europe 's currencies will be brought within the community domain .
economic policy , however , will not .
it is not good for this situation to continue .
the union needs global macroeconomic management . '
it must simply be able to exercise better the competences which it already enjoys . '
the contradiction reflected by these two quotes is common to all the union 's institutions .
one statement derives from the need to respect public opinion , the other from the need to support the single currency .
following the igc , one of the two - respect for public opinion , or support for the single currency - must prevail .
we do not want such a state .
we want it all the less because , behind all the fine speeches about a people 's europe , transparency , democracy , employment and prosperity , lies petty political manoeuvring .
at maastricht , we paid dearly for the agreement of portugal , spain , greece and ireland , with the creation of the cohesion fund .
this year , it is the united kingdom with which we shall have to compromise .
the spectre of mad cow disease hung over the turin summit .
the member states have agreed to pay 70 % of the cost of slaughtering old british cows at the end of their productive life .
this is a wasted effort , however , since the british government is already contesting the legality of the ban on its beef exports at the european court of justice .
and , to cap it all , the conclusion of the intergovernmental conference will have to wait until after the general election is held in the united kingdom !
whatever next !
if the revision of the treaties were to be the key issue in a democratic election enabling european citizens to express their views , that really would be something .
once again , hidden behind the great plans and fine speeches lie quibbling , horse-trading , undeclared aims and financial designs .
no : whatever clothes you try to dress this monster in , we want nothing to do with such a europe .
the intergovernmental conference , in its present form , is in danger of becoming a hotch-potch .
in the absence of a clear analysis of the world situation , there is no real principle underpinning the conference .
let us take the case of the fight against unemployment and external policy .
the reality which we are refusing to see and put a name to is the following . today , there is only one major power left in the world : the united states .
having played a decisive role in the victory in the second world war , in 1989 , the united states won the cold war with the soviet union .
the united states is in a position to lay down the law to the international community .
in economic terms , this is the law of unrestricted freedom of trade , from which , for historical reasons , the big american companies are able to profit most .
the free trade imposed by the united states calls into question the various social protection systems which exist in europe .
it is at the root of both the relocations which are leading to the rise in unemployment in the member states , and the increasing pressure to reduce wages and even the purchasing power of the mass of workers .
because it will not call into question the ' leadership ' of the united states - which would not prevent friendship with the american people , however - the european union is subject to this global law .
as a result , it cannot tackle unemployment at its root , and it is proposing no more than stop-gap measures and limited adjustments .
in political terms , europe is obliged to support the establishing of the new world order as defined by the united states .
whether the member states retain their freedom or speak with a single voice , whether external policy decisions are taken unanimously , by majority or qualified majority , nothing will change this fundamental reality .
and what are europe 's plans for the world order ?
they do not exist .
they would have to be defined on the basis of national realities , and we are a long way from that .
in these circumstances , the igc will bring no improvement , other than in procedural details .
the european union seems to be afflicted with the same disease as byzantium at the time of its decline : a lack of self-assertion and a lack of courage .
europe today too often gives the sad impression of being an association of shopkeepers - prisoners of their own interests , incapable of either solving current problems collectively or mapping out a clear vision of the future .
it is in this light that i cast my vote on the joint motion for a resolution .
we want the eu to continue to be an organisation for civil cooperation between independent states .
we also believe that the intergovernmental conference should be urged by the european parliament to take up the issue of the emu convergence criteria and recognise the link between unemployment and those criteria .
the national front is committed to defending the identity of the peoples of europe , their sovereignty and independence , and their inalienable right and freedom to choose their own destiny .
clearly , these legitimate demands are in conflict with those of the postmaastricht european muddle which the igc is preparing for us .
in any event , the national front demands that the peoples of europe should be directly consulted in a referendum to decide on the approval or rejection of maastricht ii .
much less technocracy and much more direct democracy can only benefit europe .
increasing unemployment and poverty in europe will not be solved by a further expansion of the eu 's political influence .
increasing supranationalism within the union will only remove political decision-makers still further from the people .
democracy becomes difficult to discern when , because of ambiguous political structures , decision-makers at national or european level can blame the problems faced by society on one another .
it is my firm belief that the european union should be a forum for cooperation between sovereign states in which ultimate accountability to the voters lies with the national parliaments .
i hope that the intergovernmental conference will produce a result which makes the european union simpler and less bureaucratic .
a large majority of our group could not support the resolution because it falls far short of the reforms that are needed in the eu today .
instead of addressing the burning issues that the eu is already facing and will face in the foreseeable future , the review conference provided for in the maastricht treaty is restricted to institutional reforms in the narrowest sense .
in this way it has squandered another opportunity to make good its own claim to an active role in the development of the reform process .
alongside that failure , any individual textual nuances over which we might quibble pale into insignificance .
the message to parliament is the same one that europe ought to take to heart in the global context : ask not what the world can do for you - ask what you can do for the world .
but a genuine process of democratic reform of the eu is obviously still a long way off !
oostlander report ( a4-101 / 96 )
nevertheless , the diversity of these countries and their differences - not least economic and social - from the member states of the union will make this process a difficult one .
how can we accomplish it quickly ?
what kind of institutions will enable us to assimilate these disparate nations ?
the turin european council gave the intergovernmental conference a mandate to seek solutions , but regrettably failed to provide guidelines for a specific vision of the future institutional architecture of an enlarged europe .
the oostlander report , which was presented to the house today , corresponds to an ultra-federalist concept of the future , which raises more problems than it solves , and which now appears to have minority support in europe .
it assumes that the countries of central and eastern should accede to the community en bloc , with institutional unity , and only some slight differences as regards their respective speeds .
with these words , the oostlander report aims in particular at the extension of qualified majority voting , which is meant to facilitate the functioning of an enlarged europe .
we might well ask how .
because if it is difficult to take decisions unanimously in an organization with 25 members , it is unacceptable to take decisions by majority in an organization with 25 disparate members .
in reality , the only solution is to abandon the dogma of institutional unity and accept variable geometry .
this also means that we must opt for a european partnership of nations , rather than a federal europe .
this will enable us to welcome the countries of central and eastern europe more effectively and more quickly .
in a european partnership of nations , for example , what would prevent these countries from acceding without delay to an intergovernmental organization such as europol , with a view to combating more effectively large-scale international crime ?
mr president , i subscribe entirely to the views expressed by my colleagues , and i shall therefore confine myself to making three specific points .
i fear , mr president , that this idea is more of a slogan than a proven fact .
this tendency is to be found in the oostlander report on which i am making this explanation of vote together with my colleague mr van der waal , on whose behalf i also speak .
in practical terms this means putting a brake on a speedy expansion towards the east . that is unacceptable to us on both moral and security policy grounds .
furthermore we regret that the report pays no attention to the geographical and cultural confines of europe .
that is necessary to prevent any arbitrary accession of new countries .
any attempt at enlargement must be directed at countries which belong to the sphere of european culture and influence of western christianity including the reformation .
good neighbourliness is important , especially in international relations , but before one invites the neighbours into one 's own house one should have a good think .
the iron curtain between west and east seems to be drawn back and even tucked away , but the economic gulf between the two europes is still there .
proponents of enlargement always assume that enlargement will benefit both the present and the future member states .
that is undoubtedly true .
just think of our domestic and foreign security and of democratic stability .
but the fact that there is a price to be paid and that there may even be drawbacks is often passed over or even forgotten .
this is partly because the consequences of this kind of accession are not clear or are inadequately recognised .
what will happen to decision-taking , to the institutions , to the community budget in general and the budget headings for the cohesion funds and structural funds in particular ?
i am not prepared either as a politician or as a private citizen to write a blank cheque .
we would also be wrong to raise hopes in the relevant countries which might not be fulfilled .
despite the german wish to welcome poland and the czech republic just now .
despite the swedish wish to allow the baltic sea countries to accede .
self-interest is a poor adviser in this kind of negotiation .
this also applies to the reluctance of portugal , spain , italy and greece who are thinking of a drastic cut-back in aid from the european union to the mediterranean countries .
in the final analysis we are talking about extending the european union and not replacing it with a large free trade area with a dwindling community pillar and a dominant intergovernmental pillar .
we , the undersigned , have voted for the report .
we did so because we believe that the report gives consideration to many of the problems involved in the accession of the eastern european states to the eu .
this is in marked contrast to much of the over-simplified propaganda which is being disseminated in the eu , not least in sweden , concerning the advantages of the accession of the eastern european states .
it is also very important , as the report says , that those countries which elect not to join should be granted good conditions for trade and cooperation with the eu .
the report also lacks a serious analysis of the security policy problems , not least as regards russia , which may arise in connection with the eu 's planned development of an integrated defence and military dimension .
the authors of the report consider that enlargement to the east is undoubtedly possible in theory , but will be far more difficult in practice .
in fact , it seems as if europe is opening its borders to the south , but closing them to the east .
the purpose of this report , like that of the commission white paper on the same subject , is to review the progress made by the associated countries in their transition towards accession to the european union .
given the uncertain prospects , and the indecisiveness - not to say positive lack of commitment - on the part of our countries , they appear to be making all the effort .
in this context , it is important to point out , firstly , that the principle of the accession of the countries of central and eastern europe has been established and must remain so .
we must avoid breaking the camel 's back by imposing unrealistic preconditions on the applicant countries , or indulging in petty accounting .
the main obstacle to the smooth progress of a transition which should logically end in accession is , to my mind , the over-cautiousness of the union member states .
enlargement has a price , that cannot be denied .
but the price of our indifference and selfishness will undoubtedly be far higher , because they threaten to deprive the countries of central and eastern europe of political prospects which are essential to the success of their transition .
the report on the central and eastern european countries ' participation in cooperation in the internal market is very well thought out .
the rapporteur deserves praise for his excellent analysis of the problems to be solved as part of the preparations for the forthcoming enlargement of the eu .
and - as the rapporteur so rightly stresses in his concluding remarks - all the countries have their own particular history and cultural identity , which they naturally want and will be able to preserve within the european union .
it does not automatically mean that the new member states should , or will be able , to accede to the eu en bloc .
the applicant countries are very different , which can duly be taken into account only by conducting accession negotiations with each country separately .
for the same reason , the duration of these negotiations as well as the timing of the individual applicant country 's accession to the eu , may well vary considerably .
it is important that the negotiations with the countries of eastern and central europe which have applied for membership should begin simultaneously .
since the oostlander report does not satisfy our preconditions in the slightest we are unable to vote in favour of it .
tackling the problems and challenges faced by modern society requires the development of exchanges and cooperation in every sphere .
in this context , i am in favour of the enlargement of the union to include the countries of central and eastern europe .
this must provide an opportunity to encourage the development of a democratic europe , based on economic and social progress and forming part of a common vision of international relations .
furthermore , in just a few years , the economic shock therapy experienced by these countries has given rise to considerable social inequalities .
it would be useful , therefore , to carry out a detailed analysis , on a case-by-case basis , of the political , economic and social implications of enlargement for the applicant countries .
i support an approach which is quite different from that of placing workers and economies in competition with each other .
such an approach must be based on the aspirations of the peoples concerned , and on the promotion of human potential , employment , democracy , peace and security .
the campaign for disarmament and demilitarization is thus an essential aspect of our security on the european continent .
the bloc mentality and military designs of organizations such as nato or the western european union will have no place in the europe of the future .
the report contains advances - regarding in particular the defence of human and minority rights , and the intention not to encourage privatization in the fields of culture , education and health , in the interests of social cohesion .
nevertheless , it does also contain dangers .
for all these reasons , i have abstained from voting on the report .
our group abstained from this vote . the reason for our abstention is not that we were in any way unappreciative of the work of mr oostlander and the members who supported him .
wherever he took a stance against the new manifestations of western european isolationism , which mainly lurk behind financial issues , he deserved and he had our support .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
welcome
i wish to announce that our parliament is honoured to welcome in the official gallery a parliamentary delegation from the ukrainian parliament .
this delegation , which is led by mr andrei mostytsky , will have working meetings today and tomorrow with our parliament 's delegation on relations with the ukraine .
i address our greetings to the ukrainian delegation and wish it every success in its contacts and meetings with our parliament .
welcome to you .
chernobyl , prospects for eu involvement
the next item is the statements by the council and the commission , on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the chernobyl accident , on the impact and prospects for european union involvement .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to make it quite clear from the start . chernobyl must and shall be closed down .
it is a monumental affront to human civilization and totally unacceptable that the plant is still in operation .
this is my policy , and the commission 's , and that is how it has been pursued in all fora .
it is now 10 years since the chernobyl accident occurred .
the memory of this tragedy remains as clear as if it had happened yesterday .
it will , unfortunately , remain with us for many generations to come .
chernobyl has become yet another symbol of the unthinkable on a par with very few other human catastrophes .
the shock was so great because this accident not only affected the immediate vicinity , but also areas thousands of kilometres from the scene .
it affected , and continues to affect , all of us directly .
various organizations have analysed the effects on health , the environment and the economy .
sometimes the findings of these investigations are fairly similar , while in other instances , assessments of the consequences of the disaster are quite different .
for example , the who , the commission and other international organizations estimate the number of deaths definitely attributable to the direct effects of radiation at about 30 .
other assessments put the number of deaths resulting from the accident far higher .
but let us not discuss the number of victims at this juncture .
every individual person who dies , or suffers as a result of the accident , is one too many .
ladies and gentlemen , our common position must be that such an accident must never happen again .
the conditions for world-wide cooperation have never been as good as at present .
in contrast with 1986 the world is no longer divided by the cold war .
in place of earlier confrontation , we have now established a network of cooperation with the countries of the former soviet union .
i can illustrate this by means of two examples .
at the end of this week the g7 countries are to hold a summit on nuclear safety with president yeltsin in moscow , which president kuchma will also attend .
such a meeting , which is to deal exclusively with co-operation in these areas , would have been quite unthinkable 10 years ago .
the commission is convinced that it will be able to contribute towards the promotion and spread of a highly developed safety culture at an international level .
the second example is the commission 's satisfaction at president kuchma 's decision to close down chernobyl by the year 2000 .
together with the g7 countries we will continue to work with ukraine and the international financial institutions for complete implementation of the memorandum signed in ottawa in 1995 with that objective .
as regards the health situation in general , the european commission assists via its humanitarian office echo with medical resources and the monitoring of the rural population .
the commission also supplies special equipment for the treatment of thyroid gland cancer in children in kiev and minsk , and is helping to rehabilitate a children 's hospital in minsk .
a programme has been set up to educate and train medical specialists , and facilities for the production of iodized salt and medicine for the treatment of cancer of the thyroid gland are about to be installed .
such measures meet a very specific need , and we should , of course , continue with them .
this applies to programmes such as those in phare and tacis .
an important step forward - as i have already stressed - is the signing of the g7ukraine memorandum on the closure of the chernobyl nuclear power station .
it covers the restructuring of the energy supply sector , an energy investment programme , nuclear safety planning of the social repercussions , economic resources and implementation surveys .
there are about 4 000 people working at the chernobyl plant at present . in addition , the plant provides income for the town of slavuchid .
in addition to solving the problem of the actual chernobyl plant , there is also the problem of dealing with the contaminated waste from the surrounding area .
immediately after the accident in 1986 , the radioactive waste was collected and deposited at between 600-800 different sites , some temporary and some permanent .
in some of the places where waste has been deposited and stored , the ground water has been contaminated , and there is a need for isolating it or carrying out a clean-up operation .
the european commission has also launched an investigation into the various options for the rehabilitation of the regions contaminated by the fallout from the accident .
what have we learnt from this accident ?
then there was the question of reactor safety and the prevention of future accidents .
reactors of the chernobyl type , the so-called rbmk reactors , have never been constructed outside the soviet union .
in 1986 , the nuclear safety authorities and operators of nuclear power stations in the community had learned from the three mile island accident in the usa in 1979 .
this accident highlighted the need to pay greater attention to the human factor , the interface between man and machine , the reliability of the control instruments and to operating instructions .
the chernobyl accident confirmed the importance of these aspects and emphasised further the need for a well prepared disaster plan outside the actual nuclear power station .
the competent authorities in the member states take account of all these aspects when authorizing the operation of nuclear plants .
for its part , the european commission supports the development of these aspects of nuclear safety through numerous groups of experts and study activities .
by means of the second and subsequent framework programmes for research and technological development , and through the activities of the joint research centre , the community is making a major contribution towards the prevention of serious accidents .
together , these activities contribute towards the further strengthening of safety consciousness and the safety of all bodies involved in the safe operation of nuclear plants .
this safety culture results , in turn , in an ongoing improvement of the level of safety in existing and planned plants .
the nuclear safety convention drawn up under the auspices of the international atomic energy organisation in 1994 will make a contribution towards global nuclear safety .
it has been signed by more than 50 states , including the 15 member states of the union , and the former soviet union .
the aim of the convention is to promote a high level of safety in nuclear power plants , to prevent accidents and to minimize their repercussions .
the convention is expected to come into force in 1997 or , possibly , this year .
suppliers of equipment , operators , safety agencies , the relevant national authorities and the european union 's institutions , are each playing their role as laid down in the treaties and national legislation .
but there is still a great deal to be done .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am sorry to have arrived a little late , but i would like to explain the reasons for that .
commissioner bjerregaard has very exhaustively set out everything that has been done by the union , so there is no need for me to exceed my speaking time .
this set of measures , this chapter of the action programme on the environment , also includes and develops a series of legislative documents , directives and regulations which have gradually been adopted over the last ten years .
but as i say , commissioner bjerregaard has already covered all these points in detail .
the council dealt specifically with a number of individual situations relating to reactors in operation .
i will not dwell on this point any further as , once again , commissioner bjerregaard has discussed it in great detail .
this is a brief illustration of the policy lines which the council has proposed and which i think it has followed with great consistency .
all this - as commissioner bjerregaard made very clear , so i shall not go over it again - has naturally raised the problem of structural reform in the energy supply sector .
this understanding sets out a series of measures for restructuring the energy sector , investment in energy , nuclear safety , and dealing with the social aspects .
these form a really organic programme appropriately geared to sustaining the decision of the ukrainian government to close the chernobyl power station by the year 2000 .
the problem of the so-called sarcophagus enclosing reactor no 4 , the source of the explosion , is regarded as a priority .
it is certainly in the interests of the whole international community that this memorandum of understanding with the ukraine be fully implemented within the set deadlines , applying the measures and methods as planned .
i would like to conclude by observing that , in the end , the chernobyl tragedy has introduced a new stage into the nuclear safety culture .
commissioner , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , ten years of effort - little to show .
secondly , the concrete casing of the entombed reactor is unsafe and unstable .
it urgently requires an additional shell , all the more so since the no 3 reactor is right beside it .
thirdly , the human misery goes on .
the environment is contaminated by caesium ; skin diseases , cancers and depopulation are the typical long-term effects .
to reiterate the point in plain terms , the nuclear risk has not lessened since 1986 but has remained exactly the same .
that is why we must all work together in order to take a step forward .
no-one can master this mammoth task alone - neither the ukrainians , nor the eu , nor the industrialized nations .
we must operate hand in hand .
the european union has already invested many million ecus .
the commissioner has kindly given us a very comprehensive account of this effort .
we shall do even more .
we want to provide more help .
it is not easy for ukraine to decommission the chernobyl plant .
chernobyl covers six to seven per cent of national energy requirements .
decommissioning costs a lot of money .
that is why those responsible need assistance .
but we also know that the ukraine is one of the most energy-intensive countries in the world .
the ukrainians consume most energy per head of population .
so when it comes to assistance in the domain of energy supply , parliament and the group of the party of european socialists will ensure that top priority is given to mechanisms for efficient supply .
additional means of meeting the demand for energy , such as combined gas and steam turbine plants , can also be discussed , of course .
there is a realistic prospect of supplying energy without chernobyl , without power stations .
we shall not let ourselves be pressurized into immediate unbridled construction of new power stations , as was suggested in one of today 's newspapers .
the year 2000 is the agreed target date for abandonment , and that is the target for which we must all continue to aim .
mr president , once again , we are discussing chernobyl .
for ten years , there has been nothing but talk , talk , talk .
it was disappointing , commissioner , to hear your statement ; and it was very disappointing , mr president-in-office of the council , to hear more empty words .
if we are simply going to come here and make vague statements , perhaps we should turn our attention to something else .
i do not forget that - as you both rightly said - we are talking about an independent and sovereign country .
and i should like to address the representatives of the people of ukraine who are in the gallery this afternoon : i am sure that it is the ukrainian people who have the greatest interest in shutting down chernobyl .
and it is the ukrainian government too , since all governments respond to the demands of their people .
so why is it not shut down ?
why do we simply talk and hold countless conferences , and it is not shut down ?
for purely economic reasons .
the european union has not contributed usd 4000 million , which i believe is what mr lange said .
it has contributed scarcely ecu 300 million : a pittance .
and so we shall go on speaking in platitudes and making vague statements , like this afternoon , and we shall all continue to despair .
everyone here , everyone in europe , wishes all the chernobyl reactors to be shut down - and as soon as possible .
however , we all wish the people of ukraine to have the improved standard of living which they desperately need .
they are going through hard economic times , although things have improved a little recently .
they have vast energy needs .
it is true that they could save a large amount of energy : however , mr lange , if you have worked in this sector , you will know that saving energy requires large-scale investment .
let us help them to make that investment .
furthermore , commissioner , i think that it would be a good thing if the commission submitted to us a report containing some genuine data .
you said that some reports refer to 30 deaths .
clearly , there have been many more .
those were just the 30 direct deaths at the time the fire was extinguished .
another report refers to hundred of thousands of deaths , hundred of thousands of cases of thyroid cancer .
and do not come back to us next year and repeat that safety is threatened , that democracy ...
no , no , no !
we want solutions .
and we want rapid solutions , because absolutely nothing has been done for the last ten years .
for example , you could begin by financing the siting , environmental impact assessment and initial construction of a vast 2000 megawatt combined-cycle power plant to replace chernobyl 's blocks 1 and 3 .
provide all the money .
it will be worth it , for what we are doing now is far more costly .
does the money exist ?
in theory , no : but you can find it if you want to .
you will have parliament 's full support , and i am sure that you will also have the support of the 15 member states .
furthermore , we shall be investigating ways to collaborate in building a new sarcophagus , and shutting down and dismantling the entire chernobyl plant - which may cost a further usd 2300 million .
commissioner , mr president-in-office , this will be your data - the g7 's - at the meeting in moscow at the end of the year .
in any event , you can count on parliament 's full support for whatever you do : but please do something serious .
we do not want simply words .
i would merely remind you that in countries as far away as germany thyroid cancers continue to increase cyclically as a function of the biological cycle , linked in turn to plants , animals and rain .
certainly an important step was taken with the memorandum of understanding signed at ottawa by the g7 countries .
clearly our intervention in the ukraine must proceed with caution so as not to deprive that country of 6 % of the energy it needs .
that will be the aim of our committee .
the situation has never been so bad and never been so dangerous .
but we shall not be doing any of this !
we are going to spend 18 months discussing the ' list cost planning ' for new nuclear power-stations .
after all , the french nuclear lobby , which has its representatives in the commission , g7 and euratom , is going to try and defend its position in this chamber .
the european parliament must not be in cahoots with this measure and parliament must ask for what mrs estevan and mr langer called for !
first question : how often will it be necessary to keep adding new layers to the chernobyl sarcophagus ?
how much does that cost , and how many times is it foreseen that this will have to be done in the future ?
every ten years , and for how many centuries will that have to happen in the future ?
what is the estimated cost of each new layer on the sarcophagus and what are the risks involved ?
second question : which are the other nuclear stations that represent imminent hazards ?
you spoke about those in the former soviet union and in eastern europe .
yet you too , mr president-in-office , are pressing for the completion of the khmelnisky ii and rovno stations to be financed with one-billion ecu .
why ?
on what reasoning , if there is more generally any reasoning behind your action ?
which other stations are dangerous in the long term ?
have you anything to tell us about the kosloduy station in bulgaria , where accidents have already happened ?
perhaps you are waiting for a more serious accident to take place before turning your attention towards it ?
are there any prospects of an agreement with bulgaria for kosloduy to close , or are we going to wait for victims there too and only then turn up to treat the cancers ?
finally : are the most modern technologies in the rest of europe free from risk ?
do they not cost ?
is there any thought , at european level and as a long-term prospect , of closing down all the nuclear energy stations and turning to other forms of energy in the long term ?
because otherwise , i think we are debating here without any essential meaning .
mr president , many roads lead to the mca - the maximum credible accident .
for all our dealings with accidents and disaster , is it perhaps the case that , despite the misery they have caused , we have yet to learn our lesson from them ?
thousands , indeed hundreds of thousands , of children are ill or have been born handicapped , and the rate is increasing .
although areas of land the size of the netherlands are contaminated , we have allowed time to elapse without taking action .
the rbmk and vver reactors are scrap heaps and will remain so , and retrofits will do nothing to alter that !
they have no emergency cooling systems and no fire-prevention mechanisms , and it is of very little use , for instance , when the operators say that they have good firefighting teams .
there is a lack of instruction manuals .
safety precautions on site are absolutely minimal .
the sum of ecu 550 million has already been pumped in from the phare and tacis programmes .
what do we have to show for it ?
first of all , 90 % of the funds have been disbursed in western europe on safety studies .
strictly speaking , the object of the exercise has been to open the door to new markets .
we have not achieved any more security at these sites .
there can surely be no question of that .
what has occurred is not a reduction but rather a prolongation of the risk .
that has to be acknowledged once and for all .
we are categorically opposed to the completion of two reactors which are already in an absolutely desolate condition and cannot be properly completed .
for six billion dollars we could have new cogeneration plants , generating both heat and power , with an output of 10 000 megawatts .
instead of that , money is being squandered so that some companies can earn more profits .
it is scandalous , unacceptable and a disgrace to the european union .
let me say one more thing . in western europe we have many reactors that are no better than those .
if we continue to pursue the same policies here , the next mca will come along as swiftly and surely as night follows day !
mr president , i welcome the representatives from ukraine to whom all our hearts go out .
could i ask everyone a question who may be listening to this : will the next nuclear disaster following chernobyl be in chernobyl ?
that is a chilling but a real question .
poor ukraine - they have been told that they have not lost 125 , 000 people but that they have only lost a few hundred people .
with the lack of proper arrangements in many other reactors - because chernobyl was only the fifth worst - we are going to have another disaster and the eu will have a great deal of responsibility .
we must decide that the time for talking has really ended and really put our hands in our pockets and give the money that is necessary to clean up this situation .
we know that ukraine is heavily dependent on this type of energy , so we have to face up to this .
we know the cost of nuclear decommissioning and we should take a hard look at nuclear energy .
i happen to belong to an anti-nuclear party , i am president of it in scotland .
i sit with colleagues who are pro-nuclear because france has a different attitude to that .
i can understand that .
sweden was the most heavily nuclear-dependent country , and yet they have taken a different attitude .
perhaps we have to look at the whole question of our energy policy .
if we do not know how to destroy the monster we create , have we any right to create any more monsters ?
that is really the question .
sitting up there are brave people who have come to see us today and i hope i have the chance to meet them .
we have to pledge our solidarity , not just with words , but with finance .
mr president , chernobyl has gone down in history as the biggest nuclear disaster of all times .
the disaster is imprinted on the minds of many residents of ukraine .
and not just there .
the consequences are imprinted on the bodies of people and on their descendants .
it happened only ten years ago .
how many tens of thousands of people are still facing day in day out the gruesome consequences of over-radiation ?
we do not even have accurate numbers .
that is why it is right that the international community should continue to remember them .
a tenth anniversary such as this serves the purpose of focusing public attention .
have we really no idea ?
closure is the only answer .
i fervently hope that the ukrainian government will give its cooperation .
if the rich countries come up with sufficient money then nothing will stand in their way .
but we have not reached that stage yet .
has the time not come to decide to close down the remaining fifteen power stations of the chernobyl type ?
everyone knows that this will be extremely costly , both for the dismantling of the installations and for the provision of alternative energy supplies .
but the international community must recognise that this is a problem that is far too great for an individual country or group of countries to tackle alone .
in financial terms the former soviet union is not up to it .
it would be a demonstration of international solidarity if not only the g7 but all affluent countries were to agree on a plan to make these dangerous power stations disappear from the face of the earth .
the collapse of the iron curtain has created a number of new responsibilities for the countries of the west .
now that we can afford to spend gradually less on defence the money saved should at least be used to improve the situation in the former east bloc .
and that includes closing down these power stations .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , it was the chernobyl disaster which made public opinion aware of the dangers of nuclear technology .
but that was ten years ago .
at the time , the greens certainly expressed concern at these problems , but being bound by political friendships and dependence , they were silent on the subject of the building of nuclear power stations in the east .
the national front , for its part , has been making its views on this subject clear since 1978 .
it has always been cautious as regards the whole dogma of nuclear technology .
moreover , this was the subject of one of our first pamphlets .
in 1980 , we campaigned in favour of civil protection , insisting on the need to build nuclear shelters .
and , in 1986 , the disaster which we had been fearing for nearly ten years occurred .
at the same time , he called for the implementation of a responsible and effective security policy for times of both peace and conflict .
by way of example , only seven radioactive fallout warning systems had been commissioned at that time .
naturally , none of them was yet in operation .
as for the budget allocated to civil safety in the nuclear sector , it was simply ridiculous .
it was unbelievable !
we have consistently warned in advance of the disasters that have occurred in these closing decades of the twentieth century .
nuclear energy seemed to be a taboo subject .
furthermore , information was withheld , on the pretext of not causing panic .
this is arbitrary and dangerous behaviour which gives cause for concern .
the majority of the &eacute;lite were wrong .
insanity prevailed over reason .
our leaders were blinded by the dogma - condemned by certain colleagues - of progress , mass consumerism and free trade .
why should we be surprised if cows go mad when , sadly , they have been turned into carnivorous cannibals ?
why should we question nuclear technology ?
clearly , nuclear disasters would have ceased long ago if moderation had prevailed over the excitement of all the sorcerer 's apprentices .
ultimately , it is the choice of our form of society which is at fault .
today , the tenth anniversary of the chernobyl disaster leads us to debate this issue - but it is no longer simply a question of chernobyl .
there are dozens of chernobyls .
we should like to know , moreover , as my colleague said earlier , more or less where things stand .
mr president , i am sure we all remember on this day the fear that gripped us 10 years ago .
when we heard the news of the nuclear disaster at chernobyl and followed the trail of nuclear radiation as it crossed europe we felt real fear .
it gripped us deeply .
however , it has diminished ; it has gradually ebbed away .
whilst some actions have been taken , they have proved to be insufficient .
more clearly needs to be done .
the sarcophagus of the chernobyl 4 nuclear reactor could be much better and more effective .
the original clean-up from the original disaster could have been done much better and more effectively .
indeed , as regards the effects upon human health that have occurred in terms of cancer and other sicknesses , much more could and should have been done .
most of all , what should have been done is that we should have stopped the possibility of such a disaster again .
that sadly , is our biggest problem .
that sadly , is our biggest unachieved task .
many reactors of exactly the same kind as chernobyl - in some cases in worse condition than chernobyl - still exist and are in operation in russia and other parts of the cis .
i am sure the commission would agree that this alternative approach to solving the power needs of east and central europe , as opposed to a nuclear programme , is the one that we should pursue .
on this tenth anniversary of the chernobyl disaster we must rekindle our fears and our concerns to ensure that we have the determination to take the action necessary to stop this ever happening again .
we must take hold of the initial agreement in the form of the memorandum of understanding and develop it further at the g7 .
we must close dangerous reactors - not just chernobyl , but elsewhere also - and we must resolve ways in which to find the funding to do so .
we must provide that funding no matter how much it costs .
mr president , 10 years have now passed since the chernobyl nuclear power station disaster .
this accident brought to light that there are numerous power stations in the former soviet union built with the same technology and with a highly unreliable safety record .
some of these are very close to finland , in karelia and other neighbouring areas .
in finland we currently have four nuclear power stations which have worked impeccably and meet western european safety criteria .
the finnish energy supply authorities consider that we need to build a fifth nuclear power station .
there is thus no chance of building new nuclear power stations until people are certain that they are safe .
at the same time we must endeavour to close down these dangerous power stations as soon as possible .
as i have said , there is a great deal of opposition in finland at present to nuclear power , which in practice prevents any further nuclear power stations from being built .
consequently , attention has turned to natural gas .
this would increase the security of gas supply throughout the whole of northern europe , the baltic states and other member states of the european union , and would accordingly reduce the need for nuclear power .
in my opinion this northern gas network should be added to the eu 's europe-wide gas networks .
the matter is being discussed today at the visby conference .
marjatta steniuskaukonen has tabled an amendment to the opinion on the abovementioned gas network .
i would ask you , members of the european parliament present here , to support this amendment by mrs stenius-kaukonen which all members of the finnish parliament across party boundaries support .
when natural gas networks and safety are increased throughout europe , this will tend to reduce fear of nuclear power stations as well .
mr president , mrs bloch von blottnitz , mrs ewing and mr pimenta have said it all today .
this is hard to credit .
although the ukraine authorities have pledged to dismantle the plant by the year 2000 in exchange for international aid for the harnessing of alternative sources of energy , closure cannot come quick enough .
in november last year at the chernobyl second reactor three workmen were exposed to massive doses of radiation and we still have not learned the lesson .
it is vital that the european union plays a central and constructive role in ensuring the practical provision of resources under programmes such as tacis .
this programme is aimed at supporting nuclear safety in the former soviet union .
given the condition of many nuclear power plants there one cannot underestimate the importance of the programme .
however , this programme cannot work unless the european union makes sure that sufficient resources and grants are available for tacis to carry out its task .
finally , as has been said by mrs ewing , chernobyl is not a unique plant .
they exist all over europe .
where will the next nuclear disaster be ?
as an irish member i must refer to the sellafield plant in the uk .
for many years the irish people have lived under a cloud of unease as the sellafield plant has stumbled from one safety misdemeanour to another .
we have had enough of this .
nuclear accidents do not respect borders and no member state can act on its own .
mr president , chernobyl was the accident that could not happen .
it is quite insane to imagine pollution on that scale . just think , they really said that back in the 1970 ' s .
the technology could not go wrong .
that is why some people had some problems explaining themselves 10 years ago .
the answer was , of course , that it was because the soviet union was undemocratic .
it is not that simple .
with all technology of that type there is probably a danger - albeit slight - of an accident .
but if the accident does occur , then the risk is great .
there is only one answer to chernobyl : it must be closed down .
it is the only answer decent people can give to using technology which was anything but harmless .
the truth is , of course , that we in the west also bear a responsibility for promoting this technology .
that is not the answer . energy savings and the use of other forms of energy is the answer .
mr president , ten years ago over two million children were exposed to the fall-out from chernobyl .
it was an accident that appalled the world and released 300 times more radioactivity than fell on hiroshima .
until now there has been a conspiracy to deny that any damage to the health of those people and children is a result of radiation .
the international atomic energy agency nuclear safety division has been at the forefront of this cover-up .
in 1990 the iaea published a health report which stated that there was no evidence of disease linked to fall-out and that the ill health was a result of psychological stress .
this was in spite of mounting evidence of thyroid cancers in children at the time .
because those children were not screened and not treated , some of them died , and the iaea is responsible for those deaths .
in 1995 over 400 cases of thyroid cancers were documented in children .
this was not finally accepted until the who conference in geneva last year when the findings of the thyroid project , based in minsk , were adopted .
the who radiation expert has gone on record about the opposition to this project encountered at all stages of its development .
i say to you today that one slow , lingering death of one child from radiation is one too many !
beyond the visible and immediate effects on children , the world health organization 's scientists concluded that radioactivity has a range of effects on health , including higher rates of cancers and heart disease .
but the iaea are now trying to do the same thing to others as they did to the children with thyroid cancer : they are effectively denying these people screening and treatment .
in the russian federation , they have collected data discussed at the minsk conference showing significant rates of cancer and leukaemia are dose-related - which means radiation-induced .
the iaea at their conference in vienna last week still deny these findings , although the ukrainian , russian and belarussian delegations dispute their figures .
commissioner , i would say that the iaea are not competent to make judgements and pronouncements on health and i ask you to state that the world health organization is ...
( the president cut the speaker off )
another subject touched on by the commissioner was that of the culture of nuclear safety .
an accident at a nuclear power station , in the east or the west , is simply a question of a greater or lesser probability .
please , do not finance the construction of any new nuclear reactors in the former soviet union !
i know what i am talking about , because i come from a region which is threatened by the cattenom reactors built by edf .
mr president , ten years on from the explosion in the fourth reactor of the chernobyl power station the emergency continues , above all in belarus and the ukraine .
in 1995 , according to the belarussian health ministry , 400 out of 500 babies with pathologies had cancer .
the incidence of cancer in the infant population is 50 times higher than 10 years ago .
official sources put deaths in the ukraine at 180 , 000 and birth rate , death rate and cancer statistics are similar to those described earlier .
the european union must also intervene through the tacis and phare programmes with the countries of eastern europe and the former soviet union , so that they gradually abandon or convert the at-risk nuclear power stations .
mr president , i should like to begin by expressing my disappointment to the commissioner and the president-in-office of the council .
the other rbmk reactors , a total of 15 , are still on line , after all .
we know a lot about the sarcophagus , but we are far from knowing how to deal with it .
the only thing we know about the whole business is that we actually know nothing .
proposals - for which we have paid dearly , i might add - unfortunately abound .
there are also risks in the irradiated areas of the urals or in the former nuclear weapons test site in what is now the republic of kazakhstan , etc .
it is true that we have provided money ; i make it a total of some 600 million dollars given by the west to the former soviet republics .
however , it is estimated that we should need around 15 to 20 billion dollars to do everything the experts have proposed .
it is a package - and let me say this to my honourable colleagues too - it is a package that includes the completion of two vver reactors .
anyone seeking to drop this condition is putting a match to the entire package .
we have to be quite clear about that .
( heckling by mrs bloch von blottnitz ) no , no , we must be aware that the removal of this condition means dismantling and destroying the whole thing .
that is just how it is .
i did not negotiate it , nor am i the ukrainian government , but anyone who seeks to tamper with it must know that he is giving others an excuse to make the whole thing fail .
that would be extremely regrettable .
in russia , ukraine and lithuania , there are still 15 reactors of the same design as chernobyl in operation .
the long-term effects of the disaster on man and the environment have still not been researched .
there are still the most enormous difficulties involved in providing proper medical care for the victims .
that is why i am highly sceptical about the special meeting of the g7 in moscow on 19 and 20 april devoted exclusively to nuclear safety .
there is a conclusive and authoritative study which demonstrates that upgrading the mochovce reactor to western safety standards is not only shortsighted but downright impossible .
the aim of this interest group does not seem to be the prevention of further accidents on the scale of chernobyl but rather the creation of new nuclear risk factors and sheer profiteering .
i call on the commission to reexamine the mochovce project in terms of its danger to europe and , if need be , to take the necessary steps to halt it .
mr president , the problem of outdated energy production stations in the countries of the former eastern block is one of the most serious in europe , and we all know that .
ten years after chernobyl the danger is ever-present , and despite the thousands of deaths the station continues to operate .
on the 19th and 20th of this month in moscow , at a new meeting between the seven and the ukraine , as has already been said , the question of finance is to be discussed .
however , money alone cannot solve the problem , other things are needed as well , most of all a change in our thinking .
because chernobyl is not the only place with problems .
in bulgaria , very close to us , the kosloduy station is considered the next most dangerous after chernobyl since last october when it resumed operation .
despite all the pressures by the european union the date for its operation to cease is constantly being postponed .
the nuclear station of metzamor in armenia is also regarded as problematic and others too have been mentioned here , while many more still are likely to emerge in the future .
mr president , have we not learned anything in the last ten years ?
scientific evidence shows that 60 000 deaths were directly caused by the after-effects of the chernobyl accident and not 30 . perhaps they were the ones who died immediately .
innumerable people became ill .
six hundred thousand people had to be evacuated .
the ebrd now wants to make one billion dollars available for the completion of two reactors in ukraine .
that is the price for the closure of chernobyl .
how long shall we continue to support this extremely hazardous technology with its frighteningly inadequate safeguards ?
two days ago we learned that mochovce is to be built with russian and czech money .
i just marvel at all the things for which russia has money .
french and german companies such as siemens will help to build this dangerous nuclear centre .
that is scandalous !
in germany the same sort of reactor did not receive an operating licence .
it is truly scandalous !
mochovce is a nightmare !
it endangers the whole of central europe .
vienna is almost within sight of it .
how many million deaths does the eu need before it will agree to change its energy policy ?
we need different solutions in ukraine , and we need different solutions throughout central europe .
i do not want membership of the eu to be conferred on any country that jeopardizes the health and safety of the people of another country .
i now ask the council whether its policy on slovakia is changing as regards the talks on union membership .
mr president , on 20 december 1995 , a memorandum of understanding was signed in ottawa by the representatives of the g7 , the european commission and ukraine .
this memorandum of understanding contains something good : the decision to shut down chernobyl by the year 2000 .
it also contains something very bad , however : the decision to complete work on the two nuclear power stations at khmelnisky and rovno .
for the house 's information , the work of completing these two nuclear sites will be carried out by european firms : electrabel of belgium and iveo of finland , under the supervision of electricit&eacute; de france .
chernobyl and its aftermath are not only a problem for ukraine and the other affected regions in russia and belarus , but a problem for europe in its entirety .
even though the accident had largely disappeared from the media headlines prior to this anniversary , it has nevertheless caused a profound change of outlook among the people of europe .
a similar situation prevails at the slovenian nuclear plant in krsko . there are also serious safety defects there , which could have especially dire consequences since krsko is built on a fault line into the bargain .
chernobyl has not been consigned to history and cannot be dismissed with a few commemorative speeches .
it is about our present and our future .
it is the symbol of a danger with which we are confronted anew every day . the big mca is not just a chapter in history books but an ever-present threat to us all .
nuclear safety is indispensable , not only to the countries of central and eastern europe but also to all the countries of the union and the whole of europe .
madam president , i was here in parliament when the chernobyl explosion took place .
perhaps it was the appalling vista of the potential effects of that explosion that caused so many governments and individuals to run for cover ; because they simply could not contemplate it .
it is now largely through the efforts of some highly motivated ngos and some journalists that the full extent of the genetic time-bomb which was released in chernobyl that day is revealed in its full horror .
the full impact of the radioactive fall-out on human health is still being assessed , and i do not believe adequately assessed .
already we have seen a generation of children with grotesque and life-threatening malformations .
we have got a new word in our vocabulary now : the ' belarus necklace ' , applicable to a generation of children have had their throats slit from ear to ear to deal with their thyroid cancer .
we have done too little to alleviate the pain and distress of these children and their families .
many generous families and medical specialists in my own country are doing splendid work , but the scale of the disaster requires a concentrated and coordinated world-wide response .
we must provide more medical help for these victims .
i fear that the potential consequences , should the downside of the nuclear industry become more widely evident , are probably too much for some of our member states to bear .
madam president , madam commissioner , ten years on from the disaster at chernobyl we are beginning to understand its breadth and gravity .
we know the technical reasons for it today , we know that the rmvk reactor had an intrinsic design defect .
today the ukrainian government has massive problems to cope with involving incurable radiation sickness with unknown prognosis .
the terrible psychological stress on the people , largely linked to lack of information about the real risk , the forced exodus , the loss of the building stock , together represent an exorbitant economic and social cost .
certain problems of a strictly nuclear nature remain open , and the fuel still in the reactor , the sites where highly radio-active waste is buried , and the actual sarcophagus , do not instil confidence .
all these problems are our concern , naturally they are the concern of the ukraine first and foremost , but they are also our concern .
that is the thrust of the joint resolution we have presented with other parliamentary colleagues and which we naturally support .
madam president , the tenth anniversary of chernobyl is full of flowery statements and costly conferences , but when it comes to discussing concrete international aid , we are fed with lies , sweet talk and duplicity .
and this is done despite the fact that 200 reputable scientists from belarus , the russian federation and ukraine have already identified an increase in cancer , leukaemia and organic brain damage .
for belarus , the hardest-hit country , the equivalent of 31 annual budgets would be needed to establish some degree of control over the impact on man and nature .
that country cannot possibly afford to take such action .
that is why belarus is pursuing a policy of rehabilitation , has cut social welfare and has legalized resettlement , and the whole thing is supported by tacis aid , which is promoting economic development in highly irradiated areas .
as far as financial accountability is concerned , the nuclear operators could be made to bear responsibility for the risks by means of an international aid fund stocked by a risk levy on those operators .
at present - and this is the council and the commission 's message , one which is perhaps a little disappointing , but nonetheless real - we have the g7 's memorandum of understanding .
that is the basis of our approach .
clearly , we do not have the resources , at european union level , to conduct a large-scale action programme in this field .
we need an international agreement .
we have one .
perhaps some people do not like some aspects of that agreement .
perhaps other solutions , other types of action , could have been envisaged , but we all know how difficult international negotiations are .
we have this agreement , this memorandum , and we must stick to it .
beyond that , is there room for the european union to carry out more specific measures with its more modest resources ?
i believe that we could take action , for example - as mrs banotti mentioned - in the field of medical assistance .
clearly , there are a number of medical and social problems that have not yet been adequately addressed in the regions concerned , which do not possess the facilities that we have .
this is a field in which the european union could conduct an action programme .
in this area , commissioner , perhaps you could submit to us a more specific proposal for discussion at a meeting in the near future , which i hope will be more constructive .
madam president , commissioner , mr president-inoffice of the council , at this stage of the debate , i should like to begin by saying that today , the chernobyl sarcophagus is an impossible symbol .
i agree with mr desama that the memorandum of understanding is a positive initiative , which parliament must in no way try to play down .
consequently , there is a need for a substantial increase in both investment and the political will to take the necessary measures in the area of nuclear safety .
commissioner , i would urge you to respond to the pressure from parliament by bringing forward the economic proposals that it is calling for this afternoon , with a view to tackling the problem firmly .
madam president , all the motions for resolutions call for the closure of chernobyl-type reactors .
that is what has prompted me to speak today .
as chairman of the delegation for relations with estonia , latvia and lithuania , i have visited the ignalina plant on several occasions .
today , i would like to describe the situation in lithuania with regard to this plant .
it is europe 's largest power plant .
the carbon rods which control the cooling system have a remaining lifespan of possibly 8 years .
they are silting up .
there are problems with the spent fuel rods . there are no plans for how they are to be regenerated or stored .
the government in lithuania cannot come to a decision , because it is good economic business to operate this plant .
the plant management even talk about continuing , about expanding , about creating a unit 3 .
there is therefore a discrepancy between the policy agreed with lithuania on this plant , and the plant 's management .
perhaps that is where the problem lies .
it also requires a great deal of money .
i welcome the g7 memorandum , but in my view this should be a subject for more in-depth consideration by the intergovernmental conference .
it is , in fact , one of the biggest problems associated with the enlargement , etc. i also support those colleagues who regard this as a global commitment .
a common feature was everyone 's very great concern about the past 10 years and whether a similar situation could arise , and i do not think that any of us today could rule out that possibility .
that is why , over the last 10 years , we have been very concerned to find out whether we could have managed things better than we managed the events surrounding chernobyl .
there have been quite a lot of different figures put forward regarding the nature of the accident and the number of victims .
it is often the way that there are different measurements of this kind of thing .
i have based my information on who data , but it is not so much the numbers which should concern us , but rather the will to help the victims which we know there have been .
i personally regard that as a very important effort over the 10 years .
also the last comments from mr sindal regarding the situation in lithuania were instructive .
i do not , therefore , think that we have merely been talking .
i think that there has been international co-operation . i believe , also , that considerable efforts have been made .
both for ukraine and the people of ukraine , of course , not enough effort has been made , and until then there is a major task ahead of us .
thank you for the debate .
certainly we must do far more , that seems obvious : we must do far more now and we will have to do far more in the future .
let me say quite frankly that far more needs to be done in many respects , but i do not think it is possible to do everything for everyone in every case .
so it cannot be said that the states are doing nothing and it certainly cannot be said that the european union is doing nothing .
i would also like to make some detailed comments . a lot has been said about the ukraine , and we naturally extend our solidarity to the ukrainian delegation here today .
but we also need to talk about belarus , which is suffering equally serious pollution and human and social damage .
i also want to say that mrs stirbois is right - she is not in the chamber at the moment - that there are also power stations in the west which may present risks .
i hope it will be approved as a further demonstration that parliament is also determined to help on the chernobyl issue .
i have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
situation in the middle east
the next item is the statement by the council on the situation in the middle east .
the issue we now have to deal with is a very delicate , very complex and very difficult one .
the union has done everything possible and has spared no effort to try to reach , or at least facilitate , a solution to the troubles in the middle east .
but the vision has not always coincided ; sometimes it has been complementary .
as you know , many steps have been taken subsequently in the midst of great difficulty , difficulty that certainly did not result from lack of determination on the part of the presidency , the council and the commission .
the troika was able to visit certain middle eastern capitals ; in fact if i am not mistaken it is in beirut or damascus or amman or tel aviv at this very moment .
there have been some results , fewer than we would have hoped , it is true , but account has to be taken of the objective situation .
i would like to mention one as a reminder to us all : the visibility of the union at the palestinian elections last january .
the union has also made a significant commitment to the peace process , and not just this year , with support to palestine and the palestinian national government .
i think the european union , strengthened by this record , has been in a position to express its concern about what is happening in lebanon today .
the recommendation and the hope , all too obvious , is that violence will not breed violence , that chain reactions will not be triggered off and endanger the peace process .
the member states of the union regard the peace process as important because of the concrete results already achieved , and everyone is determined to do everything possible to prevent those achievements being compromised .
in summary , the objectives proposed by the council and the union are to implement united nations security council resolution 425 , urging all to exercise moderation , and above all to end military action .
all the countries involved are being asked to contribute , as far as possible , to a reduction in the level of tension and above all - i repeat - to abstain from the use of force .
ladies and gentlemen , the union - as i said at the start - reaffirms israel 's right to its own security and condemns the violence of hizbollah which has caused a reaction by israel .
but at the same time , the union expresses its concern about the effects the israeli reaction has had on the unarmed civilian population , and an emergency plan to assist the populations directly affected is being implemented .
i think this action is strengthened by what has been done over the last few years .
the italian presidency is maintaining that policy , especially by coordinating its own action with the countries of the area on the one hand , and with the united states and with egypt on the other .
there is an american delegation in rome at this very moment for that purpose .
it hardly needs sating that the attention of the council and of all the member states represented by the council is concentrated on this issue .
next monday 's general affairs council in luxembourg will definitely go further into the situation in the light of any information it has been possible to obtain .
the problem is close to all our hearts and has dramatically worsened in the last few days and hours .
madam president , i would like to thank the president-in-office for his report and we were particularly pleased to hear that the troika are at this moment active in the region .
it is important that the european council is seen to act through the troika rather than just leaving actions to individual member states of the union , no matter how worthy and welcome those individual actions may be .
it is the action of the european union that my group believes is crucial at this moment .
those of us who have vested much hope and expectation in the middle east process are today sad and despairing .
on behalf of the socialist group today we extend our undiluted support for that peace process .
we offer our support as well to the israeli labour government and those of their arab neighbours who have met the challenge of peace and have become bigger men because of it .
let us also not underestimate the immense provocation to which the israeli people have been subjected and to which their labour government has steadfastly over months urged understanding and tolerance .
what were they supposed to do in the face of unprecedented murders , terrorism and sustained attack ?
it is always more difficult to tell your friends and those you respect that you believe they are wrong .
yet today my group urges israel to stop the bombing and action in lebanon which we believe cannot be right and cannot aid a long-term solution .
rather it perpetuates hate , encourages yet more young arabs to take up arms against israel and it destabilizes israel 's friendly arab neighbours .
we condemn utterly those in lebanon who have permitted the attacks against israel to continue from lebanese territory .
we deplore the hand of iran in this and look to syria to exercise leverage in lebanon if it truly seeks peace as its leaders so recently assured a delegation from my group that it did .
the european union has a growing responsibility to support those seeking peace on its borders .
we owe it to israel and to the palestinians .
we owe it to the memory of yitzhak rabin and we owe it as well to shimon peres and to yasser arafat .
of course we want israel to stop the bombing that is causing such human misery to the civilian population in lebanon .
but we also demand solidarity and real political commitment to support israeli civilians against the terror of the extremists .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the situation in the middle east is now extremely grave and there is a long list of victims on all sides .
in the face of this reality , sad as it is for the prospect of peace , i wish the european union had done much more than it already has .
the immediate measures have four ingredients : on the one hand , an end to terrorist acts against israel and provision of the security guarantees which that demands .
on the other hand , immediate cessation of bombardments by israel and the withdrawal of israeli forces from the security zone in south lebanon .
long-term policy amounts in essence to just one thing - the continuation and support of the peace process already started .
so far as long-term policy is concerned , in other words the peace process , there is no doubt that to continue and support this process is the only guarantee of peace in the area .
in that sector we do in fact see substantial intervention and help , at least from the commission .
yet , still more initiatives are needed and must be undertaken by the union .
i have already spoken about putting forward a range of trust-building measures to guarantee the continuation and support of the peace process .
no doubt there are other specific activities that could take place to make the most of such channels as the union has already opened , but also - and why not - to open fresh ones as well .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , a motion has been tabled which expresses the anxiety of all the political groups in this house .
on behalf of the european people 's party , i call for a vote in favour of that motion .
the first has already paid for his courageous commitment to peace with his life , and the position of the second is now being weakened by the new situation in the region .
the european union and its member states must do everything possible to prevent the logic of peace from being replaced by a logic of war , through a deadly sequence of events which no one is able to stop .
we must reaffirm unequivocally the right of the israeli people to live in peace and security within their internationally recognized and guaranteed borders .
at the same time , however , we must recognize , with equal formality and commitment , the right of the palestinian and lebanese peoples to live in peace within states whose territorial integrity and sovereignty must be recognized .
we must call on all the warring parties to show the spirit of conciliation that is needed for the continuation of the peace process .
it is hard to accept without comment the statement by the israeli prime minister that it is too early to negotiate .
it is never too early to negotiate to stop a war : to say otherwise would be to admit that a war can be justified and to exclude any kind of preventive diplomacy .
no one doubts the ability of the israeli army to destroy hizbollah - but at the cost of how many ' martyrs ' whose successors will demand vengeance ?
furthermore , there is nothing to say that this is the israeli government 's objective - for is it not syria , through poor lebanon , which is its target ?
is it therefore reasonable to call on the head of the lebanese government to disarm hizbollah , whilst continuing to occupy part of that country 's territory ?
evacuation and disarmament must go hand in hand .
today , it is the rebuilding of lebanon which is being called into question .
how many years will it take to erase from the collective mind of the peoples of the region the painful memories of the present conflict and those which have preceded it ?
the solution to the conflict will not be military , but diplomatic .
similarly , we are entitled to call on our american partner , the united states government - whose opinion , we know , counts for a great deal with the israeli government - to play a mediating role .
we welcome the ceasefire plan proposed by the united states government , but the ceasefire must be implemented without delay .
in particular , the israeli air force 's bombing raids on civilian targets in lebanon must end immediately , because as the french prime minister said yesterday , they are unacceptable .
naturally , the same goes for hizbollah 's rocket attacks on northern israel .
we can only deplore the large numbers of civilian victims of the conflict and the misery of the displaced populations .
diplomacy must now prevail over bombs and rockets .
we must pray that the peace process will be resumed and continued .
we all hoped that the murder of yitzhak rabin would not be in vain , but would serve the cause of peace and not that of war , as his assassins wished .
now is the time to remember this , whilst imploring all those responsible for the current escalation of violence to rejoin the path of negotiation and peace , for tomorrow may be too late .
madam president , israel 's current actions in south lebanon do not constitute an attack , but a response to an attack .
this is the conviction which determines the liberal group 's position , and which underlies its motion for a resolution and the fact that it does not subscribe to the joint motion for a resolution .
in the present century , democracies have not waged war with one another .
wars have always broken out between democracies and totalitarian or fanatical states , and that is what we are witnessing today .
it is for this reason that , whilst deploring the human tragedy currently being played out in the middle east , we retain the hope that the peace process will not only be resumed , but extended .
in particular , we hope that a peace treaty between israel and lebanon - the lebanon that we love - can also be signed .
madam president , the israeli bombing of lebanon provokes our condemnation and concern .
it is plunging the defenceless lebanese people into all the horrors of war - dead and wounded civilians , the destruction of property , and mass exodus .
and it is jeopardizing the entire peace process in the region , which gave rise to such hope .
clearly , we can only condemn hizbollah 's blind attacks on the israeli population .
far from contributing to its security , however , israel 's bombing can only fan the flames of fundamentalism and encourage terrorism and its monstrous outrages .
in this region , as elsewhere , the escalation of violence is a dead end. such a chain of events exposes the civilian population , which has such need of peace , to all the dangers of war .
everything possible must be done to save the peace process and build a lasting peace in the region .
the european union and each of its member states must act to bring an end to israel 's military actions and bombing in lebanon .
it must bring its full weight to bear to help the resumption of the peace process and the building of a lasting peace which guarantees the security of all the peoples of the region .
we believe that the peace process is now at risk - it must be continued .
we are happy to agree with the liberals that the peace process must be expanded to include lebanon and syria .
we demand that israel stop the bombing immediately and enter into negotiations .
the israelis must also show clearly that they are prepared to withdraw from lebanon completely as part of an agreed peaceful settlement of the conflict .
syria must use its influence to put an end to the hizbollah action .
we condemn the attitude of the iranian government and we urge the commission to draw up a comprehensive plan for humanitarian aid for those who have suffered in the israeli attacks .
madam president , mr president-in-office of the council , the events of the last few days in lebanon fill us with dismay , since they are threatening the peace process which we have welcomed from the start .
certainly , we can and must understand the reaction of the israeli government , which cannot stand back and watch while terrorist attacks increase and its citizens are killed .
we can also understand the difficulties of prime minister peres , who is facing elections and is obliged to demonstrate his firmness .
and we can express our concern that israel 's response is a disproportionate one , all the more so in that it is impossible to see how the crisis can be resolved by force .
ultimately , the outcome of hamas and hizbollah 's appalling attacks and israel 's ' grapes of wrath ' retaliatory operation is a spiral of violence which is in danger of becoming out of control .
as for the international diplomatic initiatives , they are hardly likely to reassure us .
firstly , i would comment on the almost total absence of the european union , which once again has been overtaken by events .
furthermore , israel will only talk to the united states , and seems to think that it is the only possible mediator .
the united states ' peace plan has finally been examined by the opposing governments .
france , for its part , has attempted a number of measures , but without consulting the other member states beforehand - which is hardly in keeping with the european spirit .
neither israel nor the united states make this mistaken assumption .
in the face of this mess , however , let us hope that the meeting next friday between shimon peres and yasser arafat will enable the region to emerge from this nightmare .
madam president , after the suicide attacks by the hamas the rocket assaults on northern israel by the shiite hizbollah movement show clearly how fragile the peace process is in the middle east .
the freedom that syria and in its wake lebanon are giving to the actions of the hizbollah is a major obstacle to reaching a definitive peace settlement .
it is unacceptable that this movement is allowed to wage such acts of aggression from lebanese soil .
one basic principle of international law is that no country may make its territory available for enemy activities against another country .
the israeli government is justified in its military actions of the last few days to do everything possible to protect its citizens on the border with lebanon against the cowardly rocket attacks .
as diplomatic means had no chance of success they had no option other than this to defend themselves .
in the meantime israel 's actions are a clear warning to syria and lebanon to put a complete stop to the hizbollah 's activities on lebanese territory .
they have sufficient means if only they have the political determination to do so .
i would therefore urge both the council and the commission to stress action against the hizbollah in their contacts with both countries .
the independence of the lebanese state must also be re-established by syria and iran ending their interference in lebanon .
finally developments in lebanon form an additional reason to exert diplomatic pressure on iran .
iran is an important source of support and inspiration for the hizbollah movement .
a signal from the european union , as well as one from israel , would not be out of place to show iran clearly that sabotaging the peace process is not worthwhile .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , once again , lebanon is being battered and bruised in a war which the two rival powers in the region are waging on its territory .
syria arms the hizbollah militias in their war - which it firmly controls - against israel .
hizbollah was created by and for syria .
given that the israelis know and declare that the syrian authorities are behind hizbollah , therefore , why do they not hit damascus - for that is where the movement 's leaders live ?
its arms dumps , barracks and training camps are all in syria .
the truth is plain to see .
israel and syria have a cynical , immoral and dishonourable pact to keep the war in lebanon , and the latest incidents are just an episode in this situation .
it is to syria 's advantage .
the war legitimizes its police and military regime and its occupation of lebanon .
and it is to israel 's advantage .
an economically prosperous lebanon would mean the return of beirut as a strong financial centre , at the expense of haifa and tel aviv .
so israel 's army destroys the power stations and the painstakingly rebuilt infrastructure in christian territory in lebanon .
consequently , this pact suits both the israeli government - which is backed unconditionally by the united states - and , since the gulf war , syria 's dictators .
meanwhile , no one cares if little children in iraq and lebanon are dying .
for them , there are no human rights !
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i should not like to miss this opportunity to thank the presidency for their kind and helpful comments .
it was particularly valuable to learn that the union had sent observers to the elections in palestine .
from time to time you tell us , mr president-in-office , what the troika has been doing and what has been happening with the american delegation in rome .
now , in the light of your comments , i can better understand why the french government chose to go it alone .
i wish to begin with the common ground that has characterized the middle east policy of the european parliament for many years .
first of all , the european parliament has unequivocally and emphatically condemned every act of terrorism , including today 's katyusha rocket attacks on northern israel by the hizbollah .
secondly , irrespective of party and national allegiance , we in the european parliament have welcomed and supported the peace process between israel and the plo .
today i know that only the peace process , not military action , can achieve this . '
mr rabin , as a former hawk , was more able than anyone to convince people that there is only one way to solve the israel-palestine problem .
his conviction and his commitment to peace cost him his life .
deaths , misery , expulsion and suffering are on our agenda today .
that is why this parliament , which has spoken such clear words in the past , must turn to israel today and tell it to stop the bombing and the expulsions in lebanon right now !
we were pleased and delighted when the peace process started and the agreement was reached .
today i have heard talk from many people on the floor of this house about war .
i hope it is not war .
i hope it is an act of terrorism that we are seeing and that we can actually get back to the peace process and the continuation of the agreement .
terrorism stops the peace process and i believe that some people have a lot to answer for at the present time , namely hamas and hizbollah .
of course syria is involved , and , of course , syria must be a key player in the eventual solution .
we as a community must act together and i am delighted to hear the president-inoffice say that the troika is currently looking at the situation .
i hope that just looking at the situation actually produces some results , because we must get a solution !
we cannot , as a community , keep depending on the united states to solve all the problems in the world , and that is what it currently looks like .
we must get up a little bit earlier , as president clinton has advised us .
but we must also understand the israeli response to the current situation .
i am convinced , having been to israel a couple of times recently , that they seek and desire peace .
in the negotiations and in the agreement they have already given up a lot .
they have given much towards the peace process and yet we are not seeing the peace process being delivered from the other side .
i do not myself feel inclined , therefore , to condemn outright the israeli response to what is happening at the present time .
when they were under attack , when their citizens were being killed , it was not easy for them .
we must look at the whole situation .
there is one government in the middle east which is guilty of crimes within its own country as well as within the middle east generally and that , of course , is iran .
we need concerted action from the community , we need coordinated action , and i hope that the troika can deliver it .
mr president , this parliament has expressed on numerous occasions its unequivocal support for the middle east peace process initiated by the oslo agreements .
with equal firmness , it has condemned the terrorist attacks which directly threaten that process by sustaining a familiar strategy of raising tension .
it has also said , though , that combating terrorism effectively means bringing an end to the conditions which provide its breedingground .
rather , they will be eliminated by strictly complying with the commitments made to the palestinian national authority .
similarly , the israeli army 's disproportionate attacks against lebanon will not succeed in stopping hizbollah 's bombardment of israeli civilians .
moreover , those attacks are causing numerous civilian casualties , including children .
and , above all , they are seriously undermining the stability which the region desperately needs , as well as the peace process as a whole .
israel must cease its military actions against lebanon and comply with the relevant international resolutions , in particular un security council resolutions 425 , 508 and 509 , which call for its withdrawal from south lebanon .
it is not possible for such serious action to be taken purely on the basis of electoral considerations - unless the fact is that the hawks in the israeli army are daily gaining ground in tel aviv .
if israel complies with those international resolutions , hizbollah and its sponsors will be isolated and deprived of all justification for their actions .
association agreements , mr president , must be made conditional on compliance with international resolutions and the non-use of military means to resolve problems .
mr president , all reasonable people know that no problem can ever be solved by war , in the middle east or anywhere else .
and no one can remain indifferent to the suffering of civilian populations , in lebanon or elsewhere .
the terrorist movements responsible for these actions , these murders , have been clearly identified .
they have the backing and financial support of a terrorist state - iran - and operate from lebanon , a country which is largely under the military control of syria .
these terrorist movements must therefore be eradicated once and for all . to this end , iran must be ostracized by europe , and syria must be forced to the negotiating table .
mr president , once again , the middle east has been the scene of tragic events .
should we really be surprised ?
the considerable progress on the road to peace made over the last few years led us to believe that the conditions for a stable and lasting solution had finally been met .
in reality , fundamental problems , providing the implacable enemies of peace with forceful arguments , still remain .
israel 's occupation of south lebanon and the inability of the lebanese government to guarantee the region 's security are fundamental obstacles to achieving peace .
there can be no successful solution without the intervention of mediating powers .
france was the first to take diplomatic and humanitarian action .
the united states has involved itself by tabling a plan for settling the conflict , which unfortunately - if my information is correct - has just been rejected by hizbollah .
we must not pay heed to a simplistic view of competition between the united states and france , or the idea that the intervention of two states will complicate rather than facilitate the settlement of the problem .
strictly speaking , france and the united states do not have the same position on the middle east .
their approach to the individual states in the region is different .
for this very reason , their respective actions , if coordinated , could greatly help to bring about a permanent solution .
with regard to europe - or , more precisely , european political cooperation - as ever , it has been somewhat slow off the mark .
europe 's institutions are more at issue here than the men and women who run them .
will the negotiators at the intergovernmental conference remember this , in the pale light of dawn that always surrounds the final hours of treaty negotiations ?
mr president , i also want to address my remarks directly to the president-in-office of the council , mr ferraris , to call for a more visible initiative by the european union .
mr president , i should firstly like to say that i agree with many of the major points that mrs green and mr sakellariou have made about this conflict .
i shall therefore take this opportunity to make a number of other points , which may be minor ones , but which i believe need to be highlighted .
i had the opportunity to attend the palestinian elections as an observer for the european parliament .
today , yasser arafat 's government and people are fighting terrorism .
and i heard a short while ago , at a meeting held in this very building , that the israeli ambassador recognizes and welcomes this fact .
and i think it is clear that no one in this chamber wishes to see a return to the logic of violence either .
the european union has established , albeit timidly , a framework for dialogue .
it persuaded the syrians and israelis to sit down at the same table at the barcelona conference .
it played a fundamental role in the palestinian elections .
i am afraid , however , that those who put arms into the hand of the israeli prime minister 's assassin are in the end starting to influence and determine israel 's policy and the dynamics of its position .
because everyone recognizes the right to self defence , but it is a right that must be exercised with complete and strict self restraint .
here , we now have aggressive action on the part of the israeli government , we have barbarous , foolish and dangerous acts .
and from that standpoint i think those acts should be condemned by the european union , the united states , and by every international agency .
i was in beirut last week on the day that the israeli actions started .
it struck me in the airport that every hall had a portrait of the syrian president hafez al-assad and his dead son .
it is quite clear that syria is calling the shots in lebanon .
mr president , the hizbollah 's actions from lebanon can only , and i really mean only , be carried out with the approval and collaboration of syria .
then there would be no reason for israel to take action outside its own frontiers .
has the time not come for a real eu policy , for example on arms supplies ?
finally , mr president , did france take action after eu consultation or did they go it alone ?
and what do they hope to achieve in view of the american efforts ?
mr president , in the path of justice is life , says the bible in chapter 12 of the book of proverbs .
that is the motto of next year 's congress of the protestant church in germany .
without justice there is no life and no peace .
i urge the hizbollah and their backers to stop firing on northern israel , to call a halt to terrorism and to accept the offer of negotiations .
we want to amend point 5 of the resolution , which i believe would make it acceptable .
we europeans believe in the peace process that mr rabin initiated , and we shall do everything in our power to ensure the success of that process .
mr president , at the same time the commission is convinced that first of all an end must be put to terrorism .
mr president , i agree with the feeling in this house that does not wish to polemicise .
this is about maintaining the peace process and the peace process is today at stake .
but there is a difference between taking action precisely to save the peace process or taking terrorist action to torpedo it .
i feel that this distinction must be clearly made .
there is a necessary and objective process of joint planning which can be an advantage but may also , as in this case , be a disadvantage of the european union .
in fact the troika went to teheran on 2 april , that is , after sharm-el-sheikh and before the current crisis .
all this must be considered when intervention is described as too slow - although that is true , there is no denying it .
i would like to make two or three more points .
this is , i repeat , an extremely delicate issue , and if it is to be handled successfully i do not think everything can be made public . sometimes matters have to be discussed with extreme caution .
the objective is to involve everyone in a peace process , every zone in the area , every country and every effort they can make towards it .
today , at this very moment , american under-secretary peltow is in rome to try to coordinate joint action with the presidency in the hope that this can have some effect .
and here i would like to remind you that on the 29th the follow-up to sharm-el-sheikh will be held in luxembourg in a community setting .
in addition to this , other ideas have been outlined and the american under-secretary is examining them today in rome .
at the moment the troika delegation is in cairo , tomorrow it will be in damascus , and the day after tomorrow in tel aviv .
some things are still in the pipeline so i cannot go into as much detail as i would like .
but i want to assure parliament and honourable members that all of us , the council , the presidency , the member states , quite clearly regard this as an issue of the greatest importance .
mr alavanos is right that it is in fact of special interest to italy , for obvious reasons it seems to me , but unfortunately italy is not acting alone and there are many things to be considered .
i have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .
the debate is closed .
the vote will be taken at 12 noon tomorrow .
question time ( council )
the next item is question time to the council ( b4-0431 / 96 ) .
i regret that we are down to one hour rather than the usual one and a half hours .
therefore , i shall allow a supplementary question from the original questioner plus one other rather than the usual two .
mr president , you have said the we have just one hour .
it is scandalous that it is reduced that way .
in fact we have only 48 minutes .
i beg you to present something to the presidency .
it is intolerable that one of the major rights of parliament - to ask questions - is not being fulfilled .
it really is intolerable , what is happening now .
mr von habsburg , i am totally in agreement with you .
i constantly bring this matter up both in writing to the president and to the heads of the political groups .
i do not seem to be making much progress but perhaps together we can have another go .
i intend to have one hour of questions even though this goes beyond 7 p.m. i hope that the interpreters will be agreeable to this because it always depends on their cooperation .
mr ferraris , thank you very much for your answer which proves yet once more that italians may perhaps think more in symbols and dutch probably more in effective measures .
this coordination centre was to have a direct link with the european institutions to facilitate adequate political action .
i did this in conjunction with all international and national journalists ' organisations , and i am now asking you why i have not to date even received an acknowledgment of receipt .
i trust you will do something about that .
question no 2 by concepci&oacute; ferrer ( h-0211 / 96 )
subject : plan for joint action to combat racism and xenophobia
given the fundamental differences between the uk and the other member states regarding the plan for joint action to strengthen judicial cooperation in the area of combating racism ,
does the council intend to maintain the broad thrust of the initial plan ?
does it not believe that the objectives of the proposed action would be difficult to achieve if the british position were to prevail ?
the text we proposed takes account of certain comments made by the united kingdom delegation in particular and is broadly based on the plan examined by the council in november 1995 .
this text is intended to establish legal cooperation on the instructions for drafting the leaflet on conduct that can be described as racist or xenophobic .
the purpose of this cooperation is to ensure that such conduct is subject to criminal sanctions or covered by exemptions under the principle of double jeopardy .
for its part , the italian presidency will do everything possible to ensure that this plan can be approved before our presidency ends .
it goes without saying that we consider it the duty of every free citizen to condemn racism and xenophobia .
thank you , mr president-in-office , for your answer to my question , which was in fact tabled before the council adopted its decision .
let us not forget that racism and xenophobia are a great problem , which requires action on the scale of that which the council and , more specifically , the italian presidency are in favour of taking .
consequently , i simply wish to thank you for your answer and welcome the proposed action .
i would like to congratulate the italian presidency on the way it has promoted this issue of taking action to combat racism and xenophobia at the european level as well as at local and national level .
i am dismayed at the negative attitude of my own government .
will the council make every effort to try and persuade the british government that we need to take action at the european level as well as anything else we do ?
could i also ask the president-in-office if the final decision on action in this area will be taken by unanimity or by a qualified majority ?
this time the honourable member has me in difficulties , because i do not know the answer .
i say that sincerely .
i venture to suggest that a decision like this , condemning racism and xenophobia , would be unanimous .
it would be surprising if the fifteen were not unanimous on this subject .
ladies and gentlemen , our condemnation of racism and xenophobia cannot be limited to legislation to prevent it .
there is a need to promote moral action , because if the european parliament and the european union are not in a position to combat racism and xenophobia , they will be failing in one of their duties .
question no 3 by alexandros alavanos ( h-0213 / 96 )
subject : position of the council regarding the crisis between greece and turkey
at its meeting of 26 february 1996 the council was also unable to adopt a position because the united kingdom exercised its right of veto .
does the council consider that such a position is conducive to the idea of a common foreign and security policy ?
mr alavanos ' question is also quite difficult and delicate at this time .
a little while ago mr alavanos quite rightly spoke about the importance of equilibrium in the mediterranean . he was referring to the middle east and also recalling the difficulties between greece and turkey .
i thank mr ferraris and in every way echo the wishes he has expressed .
and i now want to make my question completely specific on the basis of recent developments , namely the failure to convene the council of association .
i ask for a specific answer from the president-in-office .
mr alavanos is right in a sense , but if it were possible to give a more definite reply , the problem would already have been solved .
the difficulty actually lies in trying to identify the possibility of genuine terms for a solution between the two parties involved .
question no 4 by carmen fraga est&eacute;vez ( h-0225 / 96 )
subject : decision by the us court of international trade
does the council not agree that there is a need to ban the use of such fisheries equipment in the mediterranean as soon as possible , in order to avoid a trade war with the united states ?
i do not think that would be correct . in general we believe that our community legislation conforms to united nations resolutions .
in fact the council has never had occasion up to now to discuss the specific facts mentioned in the question , so i do not think there is any more i can say in answer to mrs fraga est&eacute;vez .
i am grateful to the president-in-office for his explanation , but i am obliged to say that the council has been examining the commission proposal and parliament 's report for almost two years now .
it is therefore taking its time .
i hope that it reaches a successful conclusion .
furthermore , i should like to ask the president-in-office a question . the decision by the united states court of international trade is following an unstoppable course .
in principle , there was a deadline of 8 april , by which date the us government was required to ask the italian government to submit an action plan for controlling the use of driftnets in the mediterranean .
given that the italian government has 30 days in which to reply , therefore , is the italian government prepared to submit such an action plan ?
and if so , what guideline measures will it contain ?
i would like to make two comments . the first is a general one on your complaint about the delays , mrs fraga est&eacute;vez .
i was very surprised by the reply from the presidentin-office .
he said that the council was not in the habit of commenting on the decisions of organizations other than itself .
if it decides to take no action , that will mean that it accepts the accusations .
in that case , it must resolve to put the community 's house in order .
if it decides to take action , because it believes that the united states has violated world trade rules , then it will have to take the matter to the world trade organization .
my question is : does the council intend to defend the community 's fisheries exports by lodging a complaint against the united states with the world trade organization ?
or does it , on the contrary , intend to accept the export ban ?
if that is the case , it will have to draw up a policy to ensure compliance with united nations rules in the fisheries sector .
question no 5 by michl ebner ( h-0233 / 96 )
subject : protection of minorities in member states of the union
i do not think it will be difficult for mr ebner to understand my thinking on the subject of what has been done by the council and by italy on the principle of respect for minority nationalities .
certainly nothing is said about this in the maastricht treaty - there mr ebner is right - there is no explicit mention , in fact , except in the general area of the defence of human rights .
count ferraris , i am sincerely grateful both for what you have said and above all for what has been done in the past on this issue .
that is a great pity , and i believe that the demand made by the european parliament in the maij-weggen / dury report underlines this .
i think i can also say on behalf of the council that this is non-discrimination : but that would be a long debate and i do not want to go into detail .
i would like to suggest that parliament returns to this issue . it is true it was not mentioned , but that was for the sake of brevity , not out of ill will .
i think point 4.13 of parliament 's resolution on europe 's support for the recognition of cultural diversity ought to be taken up .
mr president-in-office , your answers have been excellent , but i am afraid the same cannot be said of the situation itself .
if we added all of the national minorities or ethnic groups in the european union together , particularly after enlargement , they would constitute the second-largest member state .
this , then , is a very sizeable problem .
at the moment , the preamble to the europe agreements contains an obligation to protect minorities .
when these states accede to the union , however , this obligation will cease to apply .
the intergovernmental conference , of course , has a mandate to prepare the community for enlargement , and i cannot imagine how the community can be enlarged without an internal mechanism for the protection of minorities .
otherwise many problems from central and eastern europe will be imported into the european union .
i have difficulty answering you , mr posselt , because i have already mentioned the importance of this issue in relation to the enlargement myself .
let me repeat that we are at the start of an intergovernmental conference .
i entirely agree with you that it is an issue we need to resolve internally , before the enlargement produces further problems .
furthermore , speaking as an italian - i think mr ebner gave me credit for this - i believe we have done everything possible .
problems will never be entirely solved ; total satisfaction will never be possible !
otherwise we would not be human , we would be divine .
question no 6 by christine oddy ( h-0247 / 96 )
what steps does the council intend to take to ensure that urgently required medical aid is sent to northern sri lanka ?
i think i have already replied in the past to questions about sri lanka and my reply to ms oddy is that the european union is very concerned .
i have the impression , alas , that the union does not have great resources .
i can only hope that the parties will return to the negotiating table , but in situations of this kind it is fairly rare .
both sides must be willing to negotiate and this does not seem to me to be the case in very tragic conflict situations like the one in sri lanka .
i visited sri lanka from 1-5 april and met joe green , the commission representative out there , who was very helpful .
he is under-resourced and this is bringing the european union into disrepute at present .
there are three problems which i have now identified and i would like the council 's views on them .
firstly , a number of important supplies , such as medicine , which could help the ltte , are banned from the north .
this affects children , elderly people and the disabled .
can the council use its good offices to ensure that civilians do not suffer from lack of medical assistance ?
secondly , there is a drought in the country and it is feared that there could be a severe shortage of food in a few months ' time .
again , will the council comment on emergency preparations in place if that should transpire ?
thirdly , there is a problem of lack of independent , objective assessment of the situation and suffering of civilians in the north .
will the council try to ensure that the echo office visits as soon as possible ?
you are right , ms oddy .
i can see that you probably know better than anyone that sri lanka recently reintroduced a state of emergency .
it is my opinion , finally , that the union , the presidency and the council are unfortunately powerless in the face of this tragic situation .
question no 7 by mar&iacute;a izquierdo rojo ( h-0252 / 96 )
subject : blocking of the meda regulation by one of the 15 member states
what action will the council take to break the deadlock affecting the adoption of the meda regulation ?
but there have been repercussions from the difficulties that arose between greece and turkey , and that has slowed down and hindered the adoption of meda , which should have taken place at the general affairs council last month .
thank you , mr president-in-office , for your reply , which nevertheless directly contradicts what the european public has been told .
the answer you have just given me is new and contradictory , and is only comprehensible because of the lack of transparency in the debates of the council .
the member state which is blocking the regulation - the united kingdom - has still not given an explanation .
mr president-in-office , could you please convey the fact to the uk government that we are demanding an explanation for its obstructive stance , which is a gratuitous one that is holding up all the mediterranean programmes ?
we want a clear and public explanation .
the position defended by the united kingdom is more lax and less demanding of respect for human rights , and also has no real foundation - and i repeat this because the information is conflicting .
it is prejudicing the mediterranean region , and in my view is based on an attempt to oppose the mediterranean and the east in a way which has already been overtaken by events .
we demand an explanation .
i can give you the answers you want right away , mrs izquierdo .
i am afraid your information was not correct because the problem that existed with the united kingdom has been resolved . i am sorry to contradict you , but it has been resolved .
an accommodation was reached through the good offices of the presidency , and as a result there is now political agreement between all the member states .
question no 8 by per gahrton ( h-0255 / 96 )
subject : openness and forms of decision-making during the intergovernmental conference
at what sort of meetings are decisions taken ?
how are decisions taken , by consensus or formal voting ?
are minutes of the decision-making process kept ?
how are the documents drawn up for and connected with the various meetings handled ?
which documents are publicly accessible ?
which documents can only be made available to relevant bodies within the european parliament ?
which documents will be classified as secret ?
i think the solution adopted takes account of two aspects .
we hope that the outcome of the intergovernmental conference will be advantageous to europe and that these assumptions will be respected .
this is not a question of the european parliament 's participation in the intergovernmental conference .
it is a question of public access for citizens and journalists to the documents on which discussions and decisions at the igc are based .
it is a question of whether minutes are kept and whether those minutes are publicly accessible .
it is a question of how decisions are taken , that is to say whether this is done on the basis of a vote or of consensus , and whether unanimity is required or some form of qualified majority .
i did not unfortunately receive an answer to this question .
this conference stands alone , whatever level it develops at ; it is sovereign and it is therefore perfectly free to choose the working methods it considers most appropriate .
the intergovernmental conference must be a conference that is addressed to the citizens and open to the citizens .
i am not prepared to take that supplementary , because it referred to the previous question .
question no 9 by peter crampton ( h-0261 / 96 )
however , this will apparently not allow these citizens to enter germany , france , spain and portugal , as visa rules have not yet been harmonized at european level .
could the council explain the steps it is taking to allow british national overseas dependent territories passport holders free movement in the european union ?
the member states will have this power until the council has completed the relevant harmonization .
i would ask the council to speed up the process . i thank it for what it has done on visas but this is something that needs rather more speedy attention .
the methods for issuing this new hong kong special administrative region document have not yet been established , but it should be a different passport from that issued by the chinese government .
but if the information is wrong , the presidency will be very pleased to receive clarification and further details from you .
that concludes question time .
( the sitting was closed at 7.10 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
at the conference of presidents last week it was agreed that the statement would be made , to be followed by 30 minutes of questions without a speaking list .
anybody who looks at the agenda as published will see that it says quite clearly ' statement by the commission on bse , ...
followed by 30 minutes of questions ' .
in the allocation of speaking time it says : ' 3 to 6 p.m. , 9 to 12 midnight , excluding the commission statement on bse ' .
we are notified this afternoon that this procedure has been changed and that speaking lists have been submitted and been requested by other groups .
that is absolutely unacceptable .
i do not know who has changed it . the agreement in the conference of presidents was clear .
i would like to insist now that we revert to what the agenda clearly says was the procedure to be adopted and that we should have a free 30-minute question time following the statement from commissioner fischler .
i think we should first of all deal with the agenda , that is , the first item on the agenda .
as soon as that subject has been dealt with i shall ask the assembly , which is sovereign , whether or not it wishes to accept mrs green 's proposal .
i think that is the proper procedure to follow .
mr president , i have to say that is manipulation of the worst sort .
it is perfectly acceptable for you to make that decision now , given the time of day that it is , given the fact that my group has prepared for this discussion tonight without a speaking list .
you are now saying that we should stay here and wait until this first debate is finished before that decision is made .
that is not acceptable , mr president .
in the spirit of good will and the way this parliament operates , we could take that decision now .
there is no reason why we should not .
i ask you to take the decision now , mr president !
i think it is possible to decide now too , but to stick to the agenda which has been laid down .
first we deal with the subject which was on the agenda and then , as the second subject , under the procedure laid down by parliament , the other matter will have to be dealt with .
( the president cut the speaker off )
we shall decide quickly the procedure on the list of speakers , but the discussion on this matter must follow the order laid down by parliament and its services .
is that agreed ?
mr president , our group is under the same understanding as mrs green .
i am saying that we should decide quickly whether the speakers are to be called upon on the basis of a list or on an impromptu basis .
in any case as there is another item first we cannot upset the agenda .
so let us follow the normal procedure .
mr president , i agree with mrs green , as my colleagues no doubt do as well .
i would ask , however , that questions should not extend beyond two minutes , to ensure that the maximum possible number of members are given the chance of putting a question .
one minute would be even better .
the agenda cannot be amended , amongst other things because rule 96 of the rules of procedure says clearly that once adopted the agenda may not be amended .
( parliament agreed to the proposal )
mr president , i thank you very much for your cooperation .
as you will be in the chair , i am sure it will be an extremely good session .
it always has been !
the rules of procedure themselves do not provide for a list , but there has always been fair play on the part of the members in presenting it .
you are therefore fully entitled to make your request .
mr president , i have a further point of order .
there has seldom been a discussion for which it has been so important to have the commissioner responsible present in the house .
could you please ascertain , at the start of our discussion of the item on bse , why mr fischler is not present ?
we need him to give us a clear statement .
i do not wish to imply any lack of respect for his deputies , but we do need a clear and unambiguous statement from mr fischler himself .
i must say that it is not necessary for the commissioner to be here , because we are dealing with another matter .
let us proceed calmly and with due order !
visby summit
the next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions :
mr president , the baltic region has been a region without common hope for the future , with an iron curtain on land and out at sea .
now , however , the region is busy developing the same flourishing cooperation which brought the region as a whole considerable prosperity before the communist takeover .
the council of baltic sea states can play an important role here and the european union 's involvement is of considerable importance too .
four of the countries in the council of baltic sea states are members of the european union .
four countries - poland and the three baltic republics - have europe agreements and have applied for full membership .
the other countries in the council of baltic sea states , among which russia should receive special mention , have agreements with the eu on more or less long-term cooperation .
the baltic region is the eu 's nordic dimension .
the commission is itself a member of the council of baltic sea states .
though cooperation in the region is promising , there are still threats and challenges : the european union has a land border with russia in the north .
the kaliningrad region is surrounded by countries which have applied for membership of the union .
economic zones meet out in the baltic sea .
the situation as regards security policy is unstable because the political future of russia is so uncertain .
security policy is not on the agenda for visby but these issues will dominate cooperation .
the foundations for peaceful development must be laid through dialogue and constructive cooperation at all levels .
the council of baltic sea states is of particular significance precisely because russia is one of its members .
considerable attention will be paid to environmental issues and this is necessary in view of the environmental destruction wrought by ruthless exploitation by the soviet union .
there will also be discussion of how cooperation can best be used to further more democratic and politically stable societies , where there is respect and legal security .
the battle against organised crime is on the agenda .
the greatest opportunities for further cooperation lie in the economic field .
shortly before visby a meeting will be held in stockholm with prominent business leaders from all the countries in the baltic region ; at the meeting a special declaration is to be adopted .
the baltic states and poland must make considerable efforts of their own to reform their economies and political systems with the aim of acceding to the union .
the commission and the council of ministers must provide special assistance with this .
the accession negotiations must then be conducted speedily .
during the negotiations with the countries which are seeking membership of the eu there will be many who point out the budgetary costs of enlarging the union .
there must be no misunderstanding , however .
the european union was established to promote peace and freedom and to foster prosperity through economic liberalisation and political cooperation .
european cooperation has not been achieved in order for europe to paralyse itself as a result of expensive agricultural support .
prospective members are not primarily interested in subsidies but in economic freedom and political cooperation .
in this they are driven by the same motives as the founding fathers of european cooperation .
the union is now in a position to complete its historic mission .
the eu has every reason to support regional cooperation around the baltic sea economically and politically .
greater baltic cooperation will facilitate a rapid enlargement of the european union to include estonia , latvia , lithuania and poland .
baltic cooperation also demonstrates how cooperation between eu countries and countries outside the union , such as norway , iceland and russia , can be put into practice on the basis of trust .
by ensuring that the baltic conference is a success the eu can also wash away the unjust images of the eu as an exclusive club for western europe alone .
i believe that the europe agreements on trade between the eu and applicant countries should be reviewed so that they do more to promote trade and enterprise around the baltic .
the baltic region should once again be able to become a flourishing region for trade , investment and tourism .
vigorous economic action is required from the eu for the environmental clean-up of discharge sources and to improve the marine environment of the baltic .
the eu 's support system can definitely be used better to ensure the sustainable development of the baltic sea region .
the european parliament has shown great interest in baltic cooperation and issues concerning the baltic have been debated here on many occasions .
we should have had the opportunity to participate in a dialogue on these issues sooner .
mr president , the baltic sea area is turning into a northern extension of the european union stretching far towards the arctic ocean .
all 11 states in the area are either members of the european union or are linked to it by special agreements .
the european union is also a full member of the area 's central cooperation bodies , particularly the baltic council and the baltic protection commission ( helcom ) .
at present , economic support targeted at the baltic area is still only weakly coordinated in the union .
the greens in the european parliament call for the commission to develop an integrated baltic programme .
it need not think that it would have to start building up such a programme from scratch , for cooperation has been established in the area for a long time and is indeed based on a centuries-old tradition .
the region 's own expertise and existing development programmes should be exploited and an attempt made to coordinate them .
close cooperation particularly in the framework of the baltic council is now important because this body might become the region 's most important political coordinator .
the baltic region also needs to build up a comprehensive environment programme on the basis of sustainable development .
helcom has an operational programme currently in force and this could certainly be used as a basis for a more ambitious plan than in the past .
the commission 's task is above all to ensure that it has sufficient international funding .
the commission is due to assume the presidency of helcom at the beginning of july and this will provide an excellent opportunity , nay , an obligation , to carry out this task .
in the plan for large-scale transport and energy networks a wide-ranging strategic environmental impact assessment must be carried out , because the baltic 's sensitive environment cannot cope with these projects .
a very critical attitude needs to be taken to them and an attempt must be made to support environmentally acceptable solutions .
the region has considerable energy resources , even though it also has major problems .
priority in energy policy should be given to natural gas networks ; the most dangerous nuclear power stations should be closed immediately and it must above all be remembered that there are measurable nuclear problems in the kola peninsula .
the commission ought to say how it sees the possible enlargement of nato and the western european union affecting the stability of the baltic sea area .
in this new initiative which the commission has proposed , all the various points of view , from environmental policy to security issues and economic development , should be brought together .
mr president , the initiative adopted by the commission to reinforce the stability and economic development of the baltic sea area is welcome .
the commission is not offering any new resources , but is proposing a better exploitation of current cooperation and programmes .
there are good reasons for starting from this point : established forms of cooperation must be fully exploited .
the commission proposal contains concrete projects in the energy field .
it notes that the crude oil pipeline from russia to finland , together with the linking of the eu 's and the associated countries ' electricity and gas networks , should be a subject of development .
by way of example , the commission mentions the baltic electricity ring which was adopted at parliament 's suggestion as one of the list of energy networks in the community interest .
the commission 's new initiative will only be sufficiently comprehensive if it also includes a concrete opinion on the development of the gas network .
simply having a positive attitude to this issue is not sufficient .
the development of the northern european gas network received the support of the european parliament and council conciliation committee .
interinstitutional declarations stress that the development of gas networks in northern europe creates possibilities for significant growth in gas markets and for the improvement of energy security and environmental quality throughout the union .
in conciliation on energy networks parliament 's proposal for a northern gas network - the nordic gas grid project - was unfortunately omitted from the project list .
i should therefore like to propose , in paragraph 7 of the resolution due to be adopted tomorrow , a wording which reflects the current state of the project .
in amendment no 6 i propose that the nordic gas grid project be included as soon as possible on the list of europe-wide projects in the common interest .
mr president , the group of the european radical alliance supports the resolution on the forthcoming summit on the baltic sea , for reasons which i shall outline briefly .
the countries bordering the baltic differ from each other and in their relations with the european union .
it is heartening that the baltic sea summit should provide a forum where these countries can forget their differences in order to launch new initiatives for working together .
mr president , when governments and heads of state meet in the baltic council , it must be presumed that this is to emphasise a desire for action and to underscore its high priority .
parliament has , on several occasions , pointed out the need to bring about practical baltic cooperation .
new member states , more applicant countries , everything already points in the same direction , as other colleagues have stressed .
it is necessary to stimulate regional cooperation .
the historical changes alone require this .
the differences are not really that great as yet .
the summit meeting , as we call it , followed by an actual baltic council meeting , should end with a declaration of intent to establish an actual baltic programme in line with the mediterranean programme .
the experience gained from our baltic inter-parliamentary delegations should provide parliament with a basis to support such a development .
it is exceptionally important that , for example , environment , transport , various networks and joint exploitation of the baltic 's resources are discussed and planned in a common baltic spirit .
in that way the region 's identity as an independent but very active part of europe is strengthened .
the council and the commission must follow up the visby meeting and ensure that hope , strength and faith in the future is given to the peoples around the baltic sea .
i would like to begin by saying that i have a lot of sympathy for the amendments tabled by mrs hautala and mrs stenius-kaukonen , but the principal matter is the joint motion for a resolution .
these peaceful neighbourly relations have formed the basis for the international cooperation which has developed in the baltic region , particularly as a result of the helsinki conventions and the helcom cooperation on the baltic 's marine environment .
it is not perfect , but it works without any supranational suprstructure .
but now it is going to end , according to the joint motion for a resolution , for the eu 's federalists demand that this regional cooperation , this international co-operation , be subordinated to the european union .
this is shown most clearly by a number of provisions .
the english version thus refers to the northern dimension of the european union .
that is the point of departure , the northern dimension of the european union is nothing other than a kind of imperialism , since there are only four member states among the many states which comprise the baltic region .
but , ladies and gentlemen - to speak on behalf of the peoples in the region - the baltic nations are quite forthright in their views : hands off baltic cooperation !
i should be tempted to discuss with mr krarup whether or not there have been wars in the baltic region , but that is not the subject this evening .
at that time the ministers approved the accession of finland and sweden to the union and the conclusion of agreements with estonia , latvia and lithuania .
moreover the danzig declaration referred to the cross-frontier dimension and the possible forms of financial aid in the framework of the phare and tacis programmes .
i wanted to quote the danzig declaration in the trust and conviction that at visby too there would be the same approval of that link , that relationship between the european union and the council of the baltic countries .
i should like to point out that the union supports regional cooperation initiatives in europe .
supporting them is , i would say , almost a union policy .
as far as we understand , this commission proposal will be ready this month , april .
in any case , commissioner van den broek will be able to tell you much more .
in addition our interest in the baltic region extends , albeit indirectly , to the central european initiative , of which poland has been an important member almost from the outset .
thus the initiative , from being four-sided , became hexagonal simply because poland was involved .
finally the political dialogue between the european union and the european economic area - norway , iceland and liechtenstein - involves countries which are more or less in the baltic area .
a meeting at ministerial level is also being considered to give it greater moment .
those were not just formal engagements , however important those may be , and i would remind you that the foreign ministers of those countries had been invited to turin together with those of the other applicant countries .
in conclusion , i have taken note of everything that has been said , in particular regarding energy networks , and of what has been stressed in greater detail by mr olssen , mrs hautala and mr burenstam .
the interest expressed by the members present here who are particularly close to the baltic region , in particular those of sweden and denmark , show that the region is not forgotten by the union .
cooperation in the regions is developing speedily and the commission feels that it has a contribution to make there , and is so doing .
to promote the objectives of the baltic states the presidency , currently sweden , has invited the prime ministers to an extraordinary summit in visby .
the aim of this meeting , as we understand it , mr president , is to have an optimal direct dialogue between prime ministers , to promote mutual understanding and define mutual objectives .
these documents give an overview of the region 's potential , of cooperation activities and of the financial instruments .
the initiative was presented using the existing financial funds , which are , as far as the commission is concerned , the phare programme , the tacis programme ad the interreg programme .
it is also expected that the international financial institutions , including the european investment bank , will also grant aid .
additional financing is therefore not required in our view .
the commission is convinced that working towards common objectives and implementing coordinated measures will contribute to the desirable stability , prosperity and democratic content of the baltic sea region .
the baltic region is a region with many opportunities and great potential as regards natural resources , production and trade , with a total population of around 60 million .
the baltic region is also a region of considerable importance as regards security policy ; it could play an important role in establishing good relations and closer cooperation between the european union , the former soviet states and russia .
nevertheless , common initiatives and efforts are required from both the baltic states themselves and from the european union if democratic and economic development in the region is to be fostered .
a strategy of this kind is in accordance with the new , expanded concept of security which we must all accept .
an active and effective security policy must above all seek to counter the threats which have their origins in social , economic and ecological problems .
military alliances and investment in military resources can never be the prime method of ensuring security and safety .
i therefore urge the commission to submit practical proposals at the summit on these areas and thereby help make the outcome of the meeting as substantive as possible .
finally , it is important to stress that we should not regard this baltic sea initiative as competing with the mediterranean programme .
there is no conflict between these two areas of regional cooperation in europe .
both are equally important for the achievement of harmonious and peaceful development in europe .
mr president , at the beginning of may the heirs to the hanseatic league will be holding a summit meeting in visby at which the discussion will include promoting the development of the area 's economy .
for this meeting the commission has drawn up its cooperation initiative for the baltic sea area , through which it will attempt to support the area 's development in a wide variety of ways .
in the field of economic cooperation the measures the commission is prepared to support through the phare programme include a free trade area comprising estonia , latvia and lithuania and the foundation of a customs union by 1998 .
by means of the same programme the commission undertakes to promote the achievement of free trade in the framework of the central european free trade agreement between the baltic states and poland .
the commission quite rightly draws attention to the important role of small and medium-sized undertakings in promoting trade cooperation .
in order to improve their trading conditions the commission is cooperating with the international financial institutions with a view , inter alia , to founding a baltic business council .
the commission also considers it important to link the union 's electricity and gas networks to the corresponding networks in the associated countries , such as the baltic electricity network .
these priorities are excellent , but it is surprising that the project list does not make any mention of the nordic countries ' gas network linking the russian and norwegian gas resources .
this gas network permits a good level of security of supply which will benefit not only the baltic region but the whole of europe .
it is to be hoped that the visby summit will extend the gas network list in this sense .
mr president , i should like to put forward two points which i think are important .
first of all the council and commission must remember that the barents sea area is a vital part of the baltic region .
the barents euro-arctic council must be given an equal position with the council of baltic states .
the union must also participate more actively than hitherto in the development of the barents sea area .
secondly , if the plans to deepen and enlarge the eu are achieved , this will give rise to a damaging two-way split in the baltic region in which russia will become isolated .
according to current plans the eu is developing into a tight economic , political and even military union from which only russia will be excluded .
there is thus a serious contradiction between the union 's declared and de facto objectives .
to ensure the favourable development of the baltic region it is necessary to create pan-european cooperation in which russia too has an equal part .
in principle this could be done either by accepting russia too as an eu member state or by turning the council of europe into a strong pan-european cooperation umbrella .
both alternatives would mean in practice that europe would be made up of several cooperation areas which each state would contribute to unifying under its own conditions and at its own speed .
i hope that we can promote a realistic discussion about the future of europe as a whole on the basis of these alternatives .
finally , when we speak of the development of the baltic region , we must remember that this is a part of the eu 's wider northern policy which also includes the arctic regions .
the union is already involved in the work of the barents euroarctic council .
the summit is also important because it brings together members of the council of baltic sea states and two of the three leading institutions of the eu : the council and the commission .
it is regrettable that given the importance of the summit there is not some representation from the european parliament .
four members of the council of baltic sea states are eu members already , while four are applying for membership : estonia , latvia , lithuania and poland .
the eu has a partnership and cooperation agreement with russia . the eu has a direct interest in the matters under discussion at visby .
the eu is already playing a key role in encouraging better regional cooperation between the baltic sea states .
the eu is committed to countering pollution in the baltic sea and ensuring the safety of nuclear plants and installations .
through tacis , phare and interreg the eu is assisting the economic and political reform process in the former soviet bloc .
the eu 's europe and partnership agreements are designed to encourage this further with due respect to the human rights and rights of minorities wherever they live .
controlling the growth of crime and the mafia will be vital as the eu expands .
however , the eu should be careful that it does not stimulate unrealistic expectations amongst the baltic sea states .
eu entry for poland and the baltic states will not happen overnight .
the eu and the applicant states have much to prepare before enlargement can take place .
obvious examples are the reform of the cap and structural funds and reform of the eu 's decision-making structures .
economically , legally and socially , poland , and especially the baltic states still have much ground to make up .
further work needs to be done to guarantee the rights of russian-speaking minorities in estonia and latvia .
realism is necessary today to prevent bitter disappointment and disillusionment tomorrow .
when it comes to security we should make it clear that the extension of nato to all potential future members of the eu is not desirable or feasible .
other security mechanisms must be found : for example , the reformed weu and a revitalized osce .
security cooperation with russia , through nato , also requires further work .
i hope that the summit at visby will take place in a spirit of positive , but realistic cooperation .
i should like to mention by way of a rider that i feel that the house has been treated somewhat with contempt today because this baltic debate has been put back by four hours .
furthermore , i think it is treating the members of this house and the millions of people that they collectively represent with contempt .
i hope it will not reoccur .
mr president , the major change in europe over the past few years has significantly affected the position of the states in the baltic sea area .
finland and sweden have joined the european union following the breakdown of europe 's ideological and military division .
the baltic countries and poland , having regained their independence , have concluded association agreements with the eu with a view to membership .
russia is seeking its way towards democracy and the market economy .
a cooperation and partnership agreement has been negotiated between the eu and russia which should hopefully enter into force this year .
it is important that all the regions in the baltic area should take part in the visby summit and that the european union should have a strong presence there .
hopefully the meeting will mark the beginning of cooperation founded on the participation , equality and mutual respect of all parties .
the main objective of the visby conference will naturally enough be strengthening democratic and economic development in the area . similarly the meeting is expected to send a positive message about eu enlargement .
it is also essential to give further impetus to concrete projects on the environment , transport and energy networks .
on behalf of the finnish social democrats , i should like to place particular stress on the importance of implementing and reconciling the tacis , phare and interreg programmes so that the region will benefit from them in practice .
we also support the inclusion on the list of europe-wide gas networks the one linking russia 's and norway 's gas resources .
in the baltic region there is a need for cooperation based on respect for the independence of all the countries in the areas .
at the same time emphasis must be placed on the protection of the rule of law and minority rights in the states of the region .
the baltic countries and poland have expressed their wish to join not only the european union but also the european security systems .
it needs to be stated plainly that the legitimate security interests of these countries must be taken seriously .
the baltic states must not be left in the lurch .
at the same time , security solutions must be such as to increase the stability of the whole baltic region .
mr president , the speeches of honourable members in the last round have raised one or two points on which i should like to make a few remarks .
mrs theorin and mrs iivari in particular spoke of security and also of security organizations with regard to the baltic .
i should like to point out that the four baltic countries are associate partners of western european union and take part regularly as observers in various sittings of the weu council .
i can also say that at the time the association of these countries with the weu was an italian initiative .
it was during the italian presidency of the weu two or three years ago if i am not mistaken that that initiative was taken and their participation has been standard , active and effective .
i think that should be remembered .
then i would mention that poland , estonia , latvia and lithuania , four baltic countries which are not members of other european organizations , send observers to the weu parliamentary assembly .
strangely enough , the president of the parliamentary assembly of the weu , sir dudley smith , is in rome today and will in fact be holding discussions .
another point : mr v&auml;yrinen referred to the arctic council and the barents sea .
the idea in fact will have to be given some consideration in the future too , in relation also to the application of the law of the sea .
mr v&auml;yrinen and mrs iivari have also spoken of minorities , a matter which we discussed this afternoon in reply to a question from mr ebner .
we may therefore refer to what was said particularly as regards the european countries which are members of the union .
here i should like to mention , in case it may be of interest , both the council of europe convention on protection of minorities and the central european initiative ince in this same connection .
i have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .
the debate is closed .
the vote will be taken at noon tomorrow .
commission statement on bse
the next item is the statement by the commission on bse , including the financial aspects .
since then , some three weeks have passed , and today i should like to bring the house up to date on a number of important events which have taken place , and make some comments for the future .
however , let me first of all say a few words of explanation concerning the remarks i made at the weekend about british beef .
the commission has never said that british beef is unsafe .
the first doubts over the safety of british beef arose as a result of the statement made by the british government in the british house of commons .
this was based on article 43 of the ec treaty , which the court of justice has interpreted as extending to health issues , where these are connected with agriculture .
and i cannot see any reason why i should behave differently from a british farmer , for example , or a british worker .
so i entirely fail to understand why i should be criticized on precisely these grounds by the british national farmers ' union - unless perhaps it is part of some strategy for restoring consumer confidence ?
and in any event , my comments make no difference whatever to the fact that the commission was entirely within its rights in deciding to prohibit for the time being all exports of british beef and beef products .
our intention was , and still is , to eliminate any possible risk for the consumer .
but let us return to my starting-point .
the committee took the view that these measures were important , in that they reduced the risk of coming into contact with the infective agent which causes bse .
however , it added that this threat should be further reduced by removing from the food chain all those animals which had had any probable contact with the agent .
fifthly , the veterinary services in the united kingdom will step up their inspections to ensure that controls on the identification and destruction of cattle are in fact being scrupulously carried out .
within the next few weeks , the commission will send an inspection team to the united kingdom , including experts from the other member states .
this team will have the task of checking on the implementation of the measures which have already been adopted .
on 9 april , the veterinary standing committee again reviewed the whole body of scientific knowledge on rendering the infective agent inactive in the course of tallow and gelatine production .
on 2 and 3 april , prior to these discussions , the world health organization held a hearing of experts on public health issues connected with communicable spongiform encephalopathies in humans and animals .
besides issuing a number of other recommendations , the who experts took the view that gelatine and tallow are quite safe , provided certain processing methods are applied .
i can also inform the house that on 15 april , the standing committee on foodstuffs , chaired by my colleague mr bangemann , dealt with the issue of the use of gelatine and similar products .
in addition , the scientific committee of the european medicines evaluation agency met in london on 15 and 16 april .
the committee made it clear in its recommendations that in the manufacture of gelatine for medicinal purposes , raw materials should be used that were not of british origin .
as regards the use of tallow and other substances made from cattle , it was established that in the pharmaceutical sector , special manufacturing processes are applied which ensure that the agent causing bse is rendered inactive .
however , we are not only concerned with health and veterinary measures ; as you know , we also have a tremendous marketing problem to solve .
since the bse crisis came to a head , the marketing of beef products throughout the community has become a very serious problem .
but there is only one way to bring about this stabilization of the market , which all of us are striving for and wish to see .
consumers are rightly demanding assurances that the meat they are eating is absolutely safe and will not harm their health .
stabilization of the market cannot be achieved simply by intervention buying , because what we put into store today we shall have to sell again tomorrow .
nor is stepping up exports a way to solve this problem in itself , because if european consumers have no confidence in our beef , we can hardly expect to find such confidence among buyers in third world countries .
on this basis , stabilization of the market cannot realistically be achieved unless we can offer our consumers , without hesitation , further guarantees as to the safety of our beef .
this plan was in fact agreed by the management committee last week , and is to be adopted by the commission by written procedure in the course of this week .
apart from these measures , which are intended to help restore consumer confidence , the commission is also supporting farmers in the other member states .
further to the special council meeting in luxembourg , it was decided by the management committee to bring forward the opening of intervention and at the same time to increase carcass weights .
last week , the commission put before the management committee a proposal for a procedure without weight limits and covering additional quality grades .
i know that the united kingdom government has been discussing this matter intensively in the past few days .
the agriculture minister , mr hogg , speaking yesterday in the house of commons , emphatically denied that any such programme would have to involve hundreds of thousands of animals .
rather , those animals which present the greatest risk of infection should be identified systematically ; destroying them would ensure a significant reduction in the incidence of new cases of bse .
we are now expecting to receive specific proposals from the british government at any time .
my assessment of these proposals will be based on the extent to which they improve the protection of public health and are likely to help restore consumer confidence in the eu as a whole .
in accordance with the conclusions of the special council meeting on bse , the commission will keep the council and the european parliament regularly informed on the question of bse .
i am now providing parliament with the first of our reports on this matter , and will submit a full report to the council at its meeting on 29 and 30 april .
moreover , no one can predict how the european beef markets will develop over the next few weeks and months , or the resources we shall need to have available .
we can , however , make estimates for the following measures . firstly , the removal from the food chain of animals over 30 months old .
we are assuming that in 1996 , 400 000 cattle will be covered by this scheme , and 800 000 in 1997 .
at a price of ecu 392 per head , the community budget will have to face expenditure in the region of ecu 160 million in 1996 and ecu 320 m in 1997 .
these figures are based on a community contribution of 70 % .
the costs of the disposal of carcasses must be borne by the united kingdom alone .
secondly , the programme on calves will cost - and this figure applies only to 1996 - in the region of ecu 50 m .
and thirdly , for intervention , it is reasonable to assume that if we are looking at a figure of 50 000 tonnes in april , that will imply overall costs of some ecu 100 m .
in this context , perhaps i could say a few words on the revision of the financial perspective .
on the basis of the present data , the commission takes the view that our proposal remains justified in its approach .
however , we must concede that as a result of the bse crisis , our anticipated margin for 1997 has been significantly reduced .
finally , i should like to report briefly on the discussions which i had last week with professor weissmann of switzerland and professor collins of the united kingdom .
i have invited professor weissmann to chair an advisory group of scientific experts , whose members are specialists in bse and creutzfeldt-jacob disease .
this advisory group will keep us up to date on the state of research and on future research requirements .
i understand that professor weissmann and his working group will be able to provide us with appropriate recommendations in the autumn .
commissioner , i think that in the financial estimates promotion of meat consumption must be discussed .
it seems to me not only a british but a european problem .
mr president , i am glad to be able to answer that .
it is quite true that the commission intends to help stimulate the beef market .
finally , we believe that we must choose the right moment for starting such action very carefully , because if we were to choose the wrong time , whatever we do might well be counter-productive .
thank you , commissioner , for being here tonight because i know you have had a very hard day and you have met many groups in parliament .
i hope you have had a good dinner .
it is important we recognize this as a european problem .
the dutch have entered into a slaughtering system for which , i understand , there is going to be community money available .
the uk is proposing a slaughter policy which will require some european money .
is it your intention as commissioner to develop a european policy to eliminate bse throughout the community ?
because we should all recognize that there are other countries in the community that have bse and for some countries there is no apparent reason for this bse .
i am thinking particularly of a country in the south of europe which has had over 30 cases which are completely unconnected to the british problem .
i hope , therefore , that you can clarify that position .
you might also say something about pharmaceutical products , because of the provisions which allow pharmaceutical products to continue to be traded within the european community that contain gelatine .
mr president , i shall be glad to take your admonitions seriously and keep my remarks as brief as possible .
firstly , as regards calves , it is true that in the netherlands at the present time , calves are being slaughtered which originated in the united kingdom .
however , i would point out that this measure does not represent a health requirement , but is one initiated by the netherlands .
in view of the marketing problems involved , however , the council has decided to give these measures some support as well .
as regards your question about the eradication of this disease in itself , i am sure we are all of one mind that it is in our common interest to have the disease eradicated as soon as possible .
but we cannot pretend that the answer is simply a matter of saying that the more animals we have slaughtered , the better .
we must also look at the targeting and effectiveness of our measures , and that is why it is now critical that we receive an appropriate proposal from the united kingdom .
as for the measures taken in other member states , the herds in which cases of bse have appeared have so far been slaughtered as far as possible .
there have only been a few cases , and the commission is also ready to discuss the cases which are still pending or to help with slaughter in those cases too .
as regards the further spread of this disease , i may have misunderstood the question .
at any rate , there is no evidence that the disease has spread into 30 countries .
mr president , i thank you for calling the member who represents both aberdeen and angus !
we are very hoping that the ban on uk beef can be lifted globally and we are all united on that .
would the commission therefore give serious consideration to any such programme were this to be brought forward from the uk for scotland and northern ireland ?
if such a scheme were brought forward , what conditions would have to be met ?
for example , there is talk of cow passports .
are we talking about extending the quality assurance to give it official approval so that we have in effect cow passports with visas to make sure that they can be safely exported ?
this means having checks on how the system is operating , on registration and the measures introduced in all parts of the united kingdom , including of course scotland , northern ireland and the various regions of england itself .
over and above this , a question of differentiation or regionalization is emerging , on the basis of comparisons with previous control measures .
the crucial point will always be the adequacy of controls .
that is why the british government has announced that proposals are also to be submitted in this respect .
in the first place , however , it is up to the british government to put forward proposals of this kind , and as soon as such proposals are available , the commission will of course assess them .
commissioner , you said that confidence among consumers must be created through measures to guarantee health .
do you think that a sweeping statement that british beef is safe represents that kind of measure ?
my second question is this : if , as you say , you cannot stabilize the market in terms of quantity , then why are you withdrawing 50 000 tonnes just when the debate is at its height ?
whether it is actually safe or not , that meat is going to be forever tainted .
my third point is that you referred to selection or culling .
i would agree that even in britain , not all the animals are sick , and not all their meat is bad .
will the commission put any effort into this aspect of the problem , and has professor weissmann made any proposals for tests to be carried out on live or slaughtered animals ?
there is a heated debate on this question at present .
could not the commission make some contribution here ?
mr graefe zu baringdorf , in reply to your comments about market measures , i said that intervention in itself could never solve the problem .
but that does not mean that the statement can be turned on its head and taken to mean that we should - or could - abandon intervention altogether .
all these factors , in my view , justify us taking action now .
if we wait until the market has totally collapsed , that will not do anyone any good .
with regard to tests on live animals , professor weissmann has told me that at present , there is no reliable procedure for carrying out tests of this kind .
this means that entirely new designs for testing procedures must be developed - assuming , that is , that such a thing is possible at all .
mr president , following on the commissioner 's earlier remarks , you are very welcome to visit ireland where our beef is grass-fed as you know .
this is environmentally friendly , safe food of very high quality .
but you know we are currently suffering because of the controversy .
you gave some assurances earlier today at some meetings and perhaps you would clarify for all of us what exactly you said .
my substantive question is : i would like to know - in the present crisis and on a temporary basis - would you be prepared with regard to intervention , to consider raising carcass weights and price ?
we needed this warning , however , in order to be made aware of the dangers connected with this disease .
as chairman of the french national food council , i should like to commend the measures taken by our minister to reassure both consumers and the breeders of unaffected livestock .
mr president , i am grateful to the commissioner for his reminder that the uk government has not yet put any proposals on the table .
how does he intend to tackle this ?
as i have already explained , all these considerations and proposals must be based on comprehensible control mechanisms .
this is an essential precondition , because otherwise we shall never gain the confidence which has been mentioned .
however , i also feel that our initial efforts must above all build on those measures which have already been introduced .
i do not think it has really been made sufficiently clear to public opinion what enormous changes have been made in our procedures in the course of these last few weeks .
you should not forget that animals aged over 30 months are now excluded from the food chain both for human and animal consumption .
equally , it must be remembered that the parts known as sbos are now being removed from younger animals as well , and carefully disposed of .
these are major changes geared to public safety and confidence , and they should be put across much more strongly , because of the far-reaching effect they will have .
it seems to me that one cannot rely on the idea of each of us saying in turn : ' but my cattle are not infected . they have never been in contact . '
that would just be making things too easy for ourselves .
we must try to bring about an overall solution to the problem .
mr president , i think - and this also emerged from what the commissioner said - that we are operating in an area of scientific uncertainty and many questions .
many times , the commissioner used the words : probably , gelatine for the time being , and other suchlike .
from that point of view i fear that the mistake made by the british government during the past decade may be being repeated .
i would like to ask the commissioner : for example , today , the expedient of slaughter is to be used as a protective measure .
but on the basis of the scientific information available to the commission , is it certain that bse is not transmitted via the soil or via slaughter-houses ?
might it not be important and positive , besides the information we have from the commissioner responsible for agricultural policy , to obtain information as well from the commissioners responsible for public health and for research ?
consequently , the deciding factor is this : can one or can one not eradicate these doubtful tissues or parts in every case ?
that is one of the crucial points .
as regards the mechanism for the disease spreading via the floor , i must confess that i really cannot imagine how that is going to happen in practice .
we should not forget that , when it comes to the general point at issue .
in view of the lack of time , i shall simply ask two questions .
do you not agree , commissioner , that in the long run , it would be wiser to abandon intervention in the case of british beef ?
what i personally fear is that if this meat comes back on the market in the future , there will again be difficulties .
and there is another problem : the at-risk imported cattle which have gone to other countries should now also be looked at closely .
will there be slaughtering programmes here too ?
i am sure you cannot read all the many press reports , even those in germany .
but when we read in one of the leading german newspapers : ' fischler says there are no medical reasons , only political ones ' , then in my view that does not help any of us .
mr president , i have to say that i do not share the view that intervention should be abandoned for british beef , or that this would be possible .
as for the reports in the media , it often happens , unfortunately , that a number of journalists simply copy from one another , and in the process two things are frequently entangled .
the first is that there is of course a clear basis in law for the commission 's decisions , and this forms what might be called the judicial background to this decision .
commissioner , i shall be very brief in order to allow my other colleagues time to speak .
proceedings are only brought before the court of justice by the commission when clear breaches of eu laws have taken place .
finally , it is expected - as i said at the beginning - that we shall adopt a variety of market measures to stimulate the purchase and consumption of beef once again .
mr president , i understood at the beginning of this debate that you were going to take it as a free debate , that you would see people raise their hands and call them as you saw them .
i understand , though , that you have a list from some groups that you are using as an orientation for your choice .
i think that is not playing by the rules .
i am following the rules , except that members all raised their hands at the same time .
what would you have done ?
mr president , we are all concerned on this side of the house about the magnitude of the crisis .
let me be clear . we want this ban to end .
i received a telephone call yesterday from the british agriculture minister during which he informed me that he intended to come to brussels next tuesday and would present his proposals then .
commissioner , the damage has been done .
but the fault lies with the companies - for the most part international companies - which produced the contaminated feed .
everywhere , the law says that the guilty party should pay compensation .
all i am asking for is three lists of names .
under articles 129 and 129a of the treaty on european union , you are obliged to make such information freely available to all european citizens .
as regards the manufacturing of animal feeds , there are several provisions which have been adopted over the years .
but if the users of these feeds fail to use them properly , they can hardly have the producers prosecuted for that , since feeding them to ruminants has been unequivocally prohibited for several years now .
all the same , we have to take it that this ban is not always obeyed .
for several years , there has been a total ban on feeding ruminants meal which is itself derived from ruminants .
i have already indicated that this ban is unfortunately not always obeyed , but to bring the producer before the courts for that reason seems impossible to me , in legal terms .
we are taking it for granted that everyone can read .
mr president , commissioner , i think that we must analyse this issue with some realism .
i think we must go much further and much deeper ; we must make a pact of solidarity , a serious pact of confidence with consumers without which we will never solve this problem .
perhaps i can compensate for the length of my statement to some extent by answering what you have just said with a simple and sincere yes .
mr president , the restoration of consumer confidence in beef is central to this particular issue .
i would like to ask the commissioner if he will implement an effective promotional campaign in relation to beef and also a factual , credible information campaign for consumers ?
i would also like to acknowledge the fact that he recognizes that we have a special problem in ireland . i would ask him to respond in a positive manner to that particular crisis .
we are dependent on exports . up to 90 % of our beef is exported .
i think the commissioner is doing a very good job in what is an extremely difficult situation .
it seems to me that the questions are starting to become somewhat repetitive , mr hyland .
i have already provided the information asked for in your first question , and would prefer not to repeat myself .
as regards your second question about the particular situation in ireland , we know that ireland depends on exports , that is quite clear .
mr president , as the commissioner said , there are still many unknown factors surrounding bse .
we shall certainly make a further sum available , mr mulder , if it is necessary and wise to do so .
but we are thinking in the first place of making the bse question a central focus for research , and will give bse a correspondingly high priority in the allocation of resources to research projects .
mr president , i thank the commissioner for his frank and straightforward statement .
i would like to point out that i have already answered this question too .
has the commission been informed by the united kingdom government of the destruction and disposal methods it proposes to adopt , and are these considered to be safe enough ?
we have been informed of the statement that was made in the house of commons yesterday , and the minister for agriculture , mr hogg , also faxed his statement through to me .
there has been personal contact with the british government .
the british experts have reported to various committees , including in particular the standing veterinary committee .
as i have already stated , there will be a further meeting with the british minister next week .
the main purpose of all these meetings is to allow us to discuss together the specific measures and decisions which must now be adopted .
i am closing the discussion on this question here , because forty minutes have gone by rather than thirty .
i am very sorry , but i think that on such an important and sensitive subject we shall have other occasions for everybody to speak .
mr president , i should like to take up and look into the suggestion which has been made today that i should also make myself available to the committee on agriculture next week .
it may be possible to arrange for us to continue today 's discussion next tuesday .
as everyone asked to speak at the same time , naturally we have not been able to satisfy all requests .
i hope you could pass on those remarks to the rest of your colleagues .
we shall try to arrange our work better !
mr president , on a point of order : i think that this type of debate must be urgently reviewed because we , the members of the european parliament , have been treated today like schoolchildren .
this cannot be allowed !
biocidal products
mr president , this directive is the missing link in a range of chemical directives .
it is absolutely necessary to be clear about what chemicals are being used in the union .
it is said that 100 000 different chemicals are on the market .
only a few have been through an authorization system involving risk assessment , and we see time and again that chemicals can have terrible effects on nature .
just think of the debate surrounding the declining quality of men 's sperm because chemicals can behave like artificial hormones .
under the proposal for a directive on biocides , more chemicals will be subject to authorization and that is very positive .
there have been a number of complaints that it will be costly for the manufacturers to have their materials and products approved .
that is true enough . but it will cost society a lot more in the form of health costs and pollution prevention if we do not achieve better control over the chemicals .
the directive has been a long time coming . after a long wait the directive is now complete , including annex 6 .
in addition there is a need for documentation providing technical guidance .
the directive is based on mutual recognition of the products containing biocides , and it may be a problem when not all the member states have competent authorities within the meaning of the directive .
a weak link in the chain may allow access to the market to easily .
the environment committee has therefore opposed automatic market access after 60 days .
it is also important that each national authority has sufficient information before marketing is authorized .
the industry has asked for a longer period for data protection , while the unions in the textile industry , on the other hand , feel that an authorization procedure lasting 10 years is very long .
and it is worth noting that the period for data protection in this proposal for a directive is five years longer than that applying to the pesticide directive .
on the last point , all that needs to be said is that we have to start somewhere .
the european union should set the tone for international assemblies , and it is wealthy enough to pave the way .
on other matters , too , the european parliament has said that we should not wait for other parts of the world , we should be first ourselves .
the authorization system seems to me to be very flexible and not particularly bureaucratic .
the environment committee has been given two different explanations by the commission as to why there are two annexes , nos 3 and 4 , on which to base trials .
everything is subject to annex 3 , while annex 4 should only be used where it is relevant .
but at some point this explanation was altered , so that it was no longer the animals which were to be saved , but the industry .
and this point is really significant .
parliament would , of course , very much like to save animals from experiments , but we are interested in finding out what the commission 's interpretation of annex 4 is .
will it be possible to avoid annex 4 simply by referring to economic conditions ?
i would like to point out that the committee has proposed a definition for framework authorization and that there is no need to adopt any of the other proposals submitted here to the plenary .
we cannot have different opinions about the same point .
that is to say that the manufacturers of products containing biocides can always find an active substance , though possibly something different from what they had previously used .
there has , nevertheless , been a political commotion about alternative assessment , a commotion which , in my opinion has grown totally out of proportion .
as a society we should be able to protect ourselves both with products containing biocides but also against the most harmful of the biocides themselves .
an argument against alternative assessment is that it will be to the detriment of small and medium-sized businesses .
it should be remembered that small and medium-sized businesses more often produce products containing biocides rather than the active substances .
consumers will continue to be able to buy products with which to combat a specific organism , as an active substance is only replaced if a new substance can be used for the same purpose .
it is this very soft and friendly form of alternative assessment which supplements the risk assessment being drafted .
not a lot to write home about for an environmentally friendly politician , and it is also fully in line with the fifth environment action programme .
alternative assessment is a new instrument which could well be incorporated into future revision of other chemical directives .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am speaking today as draftsman of the opinion of the committee on economic and monetary affairs and industrial policy on the proposal for a directive on biocidal products .
the committee discussed the draft report intensively , and in november 1995 adopted the opinion by an overwhelming majority .
our opinion seeks to take account of the special features of the biocidal products market .
the total value of this market is estimated at between ecu 1.5 and 2.5 billion .
somewhat in contrast to the plant protectives sector , this is spread across some 400 active substances and 7000 biocidal products .
standardizing the authorization procedures among individual countries is a sensible policy , and represents an enormous saving both for the member states and the producers , and hence their customers .
the market is predominantly structured around smes , since the range of different applications for biocidal products makes it possible to cater for individual markets .
on the other hand , the development costs - and those of licensing and providing data - may in some cases , such as active substances , go well beyond the ecu 1 million mark .
since market volumes are so limited , it needs to be considered how the necessary protection for mankind and the environment can be ensured with minimum financial outlay .
the committee on economic and monetary affairs has therefore drawn the following conclusions .
firstly , the proposed directive , which closely follows the plant protectives directive , does not do justice to the particular position of biocidal products .
secondly , the authorization procedure should be less costly , and past experience should be taken into account .
thirdly , there should be provision for framework formulations for the authorization of active substances which would permit a simple registration procedure for less problematical biocidal products .
this proposal has also largely been adopted by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection .
fourth , equal treatment of active substances and biocidal products produced in the community with imported products must be guaranteed .
the rules of the directive must therefore also apply to imports .
fifth , the fees should reflect costs .
sixth , the commission is called upon to submit a detailed study of the economic consequences for small and medium-sized businesses .
unfortunately , the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection , in the course of its deliberations , showed little willingness to accept the amendments tabled by the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
the rapporteur mentioned one critical question , that of comparative assessment .
this is a very strong measure to be applied here , and i think we have not heard the last of the debate on this subject .
all in all , the commission 's proposals will bring about a number of desirable improvements , but will also involve some considerable problems , given the special circumstances of an industry based on smes .
i believe that this is a report which displays both faith in the future and purpose .
it is also a report which gives us a tool with which to protect both people 's health and our environment .
i believe that it is important that we establish at community level a common system for the control of biocidal products .
this applies in respect of both the environment and industry .
as a result of the directive companies will in fact have the opportunity and the right conditions to enable them to operate under the same conditions throughout the single market .
but perhaps the most important thing is that the report proposes a flexible system which will provide the incentive for the development of more environmentally friendly products and therefore also for steps towards a sustainable society .
by supporting the report parliament can move towards this goal , which is so decisive for the future .
there are many who were concerned about what the system would mean for small and medium-sized businesses in particular .
this concern focuses above all on the text concerning comparative assessments contained in article 9 ( 5 ) .
there is anxiety that companies will go out of business and that unemployment will increase .
our experience in sweden , however , where we have had this system for almost ten years , suggests the opposite .
we know that the active substances which are produced are produced by large companies which in fact have the capacity to contribute to positive development .
we also know that methods involving comparative assessments have resulted in a broader range of products being available and in more companies coming onto the market .
i also believe that it is important to point out that in our country comparative assessments are conducted in respect of about 10-20 % of the products on the market .
they are conducted whenever two active substances are comparable and effective in the same field and costs are the same , but one product is in fact much better for the environment than the other .
the comparative assessments which have been carried out have been conducted in consultation with both the company and the authorities , and of course consumers .
though i consider that the report is a good one , i think it is a shame that we have expunged certain parts through compromise , thus weakening it .
this is true above all in respect of antifouling paint for boats , but i am nevertheless in favour of the report .
as has already been pointed out , the proposed directive runs side by side with that already adopted for agricultural pesticides .
the mutual recognition and freedom of movement of biocidal products should therefore be ensured , and nobody should call them into question .
parliament needs to be given evidence that the scientific and technical requirements which figure in the annexes are of the highest level , in order to ensure that the public feels protected .
if its report had been more specific , things would have been much clearer to a large number of members who are not familiar with this type of proposal .
mr president , now for something completely different ! from mad cow disease to biocides - it is certainly a leap both in terms of content and media interest .
the substance of the biocides debate , which nobody by and large understands , is technical down to the smallest detail and totally lacking in ' sexiness ' and , therefore , totally beyond the glare of the media .
mad cow disease has everything . the mad cows have everything .
but that is the way it is with parliamentary work .
it has thus fallen to me to talk about biocides , which actually have a great deal to do with health .
the deaths are simply not acknowledged .
there are probably more people who have died from biocides than from mad cows .
but on behalf of the liberal group i will say that we can support practically all the environment committee 's amendments and some of the others .
a reasonable balance has been struck between industry and the environment .
the most far-reaching , and therefore the most exciting , proposal from the commission is article 9.5 , under which a product may be barred if an alternative product exists .
i shall conclude by thanking the rapporteur for the considerable work she has put into this proposal , and recommend its adoption .
mr president , i welcome the fact that there is now european legislation on the admissibility of biocidal product for nonagricultural purposes .
that is not an unnecessary luxury on the internal market .
it is only regrettable that it has taken so long to put common principles down on paper .
the document before us , however , forms a satisfactory basis for a uniform admission procedure , in our view .
we are particularly pleased with the so-called alternative evaluation in article 9 ( 5 ) . the intention is that the environmentally friendly products will oust the harmful biocides from the market .
that is sad news for the producers of all the old biocides , but if we take sustainable development seriously then the damaging products will have to disappear in due course .
i would like to congratulate the rapporteur , mrs jensen on her report .
she has put much time and effort into it , as the result bears witness .
improvements have been suggested on various points , for example on the framework formulation .
that should prevent a load of red tape and unnecessary testing .
another important point is the question of the pesticidal paint .
we have learned in the meantime , as mr lannoye has said , that this biocidal paint is very deleterious to the water environment .
you would then be transferring employment to korea without any noticeable advantage to the environment .
that is why i am in favour of amendment no 61 which allows an exception for the use of biocides in shipyards .
it is not an elegant solution but i cannot see any other way .
that does not excuse europe from the obligation to do everything possible to find a solution .
in this context i would ask the commissioner what the commission is doing about this .
is any progress being made in the international maritime organisation , and when can we expect something from that organisation ?
mr president , the ' europe without frontiers ' needs frontiers .
in the absence of border controls the requirements relating to products coming on the market must be such that products can be safely used in all member states .
there are many problems involved with the chemical industry , particularly as regards the environment . consequently clear legislation is needed to protect both the consumer and the environment .
in her report on biocides , mrs kirsten jensen has addressed the central questions relating to the environment and the consumer .
the removal of border controls also means that there must be a reasonable level of certainty that a product approved in one country can be placed on the market in all other member states .
however , we must be able to be absolutely sure that the ' weakest links ' are not used to obtain approval in the countries with the least strict standards .
however , i am not sure that 60 days will be enough in all cases .
ladies and gentlemen , the active substances in medicines and plant protection products are covered by the corresponding eu directives .
the last major field remaining - all other active biocidal substances - will now be dealt with by this proposed directive .
these rules are particularly important for the environment and consumer protection , since many people come into contact with products containing biocidal substances .
we are talking here about insecticides , disinfectants , preservatives and products used to protect materials , to mention but a few .
as it stands at present , this new directive will apply to all the groups of biocidal products not covered by the plant protectives directive .
since it deals with similar effects , the commission 's draft follows that directive very closely .
unlike plant protection products , however , biocidal substances are a very diverse sector , as mr langen has already pointed out .
there are some 400 active substances used in around 7000 products , and above all produced by many small and medium-sized businesses .
individual substances and products are already tested on a national basis , and are only licensed for use after testing .
every test involves not only costs , but also a huge investment of time and materials , with a corresponding administrative burden on the authorities of the member states .
i regard it as absolutely essential to strike a reasonable balance here - with the proviso , of course , that the protection of consumers and the environment is guaranteed .
with these points in mind , our group has tabled a number of amendments .
it is high time that we established european rules on the marketing of these products .
the commission 's proposal , to my mind , represents a good starting-point for our discussions .
my amendments are focused on the definition and in particular the licensing and placing on the market of products containing biocidal substances .
however , there are more and more members , and even spokesmen for the commission , who are using molitor and its ideas as a cloak for environmental dumping .
that is precisely what we do not want .
of course , we do not have that impression in the case of this report .
i am very glad to hear that the commission is letting it be known in the lobbies that it will accept our amendments on framework formulations .
what does this mean ?
it means that in future , products derived from processes which have already been authorized will have a simpler licensing route to follow .
this is a necessary move towards a transparent approach to trade and the environment .
so i am glad , commissioner , that we have been able to firm up your proposal a little , and it is now well placed to go on for discussion in the council and its second reading .
some countries ' environmental conditions differ from those in other countries .
in the northern countries , finland for example , pest control agents are not needed in anything like the same quantities as in more southerly regions because of the cold climate .
consequently the regulations in different parts of europe are different .
foodstuffs , however , cross borders and the consumer cannot always know nowadays in which country and how the food he is eating has been produced and where it originates .
it is therefore important that the proposal for a directive currently under discussion should standardize the biocides permitted in the eu countries .
it is important to remember that man is part of nature and is always just as sensitive to environmental pollution as the rest of nature .
this proposal for a directive tends above all to protect the interests of human health and it is therefore essential that it be approved .
i shall , because of the time , refrain from my more general observations on the proposal , because they have been covered so excellently by the comments during the debate , and concentrate instead on the amendments .
the objective of the proposal is quite simple , while the means of achieving it are complicated , and for this reason the proposal is highly technical .
the commission has acknowledged this situation and we are therefore pleased that the proposal has been clarified by many of the amendments .
a very large number of amendments have been tabled .
initially 62 and then a further 34 supplementary amendments .
first of all there are the amendments to the recitals . amendments nos 3 , 6 and 92 are acceptable .
amendment no 2 in principle and amendment no 5 in part .
amendments nos 1 , 4 , 7 and 8 are unacceptable .
then there are the amendments to the articles .
amendments nos 9 , 11 , 17 , 21 , 29 and 31 are acceptable .
amendment no 20 is also acceptable in part .
then there are the amendments to annexes 2 and 3 . supplementary amendments nos 79-81 and 83 are acceptable , while none of the first amendments nos 44-45 are acceptable .
then there is the amendment of annex 6 , common principles .
i shall now briefly comment on some of the amendments .
with regard to the amendments concerning the articles , i would again like to thank mrs kirsten jensen for amendment no 31 , which represents a significant improvement to the text .
here i would stress that the proposal for a directive covers the marketing of all products in the community containing biocides , and that it also includes the conditions of use .
the proposal for a directive does not concern the manufacture of the actual products which contain biocides or treated materials , i.e. materials which are treated with products containing biocides .
neither does the directive cover products containing biocides which are destined for export outside the community .
amendments nos 42 and 43 , finally , aim to introduce economic means or other measures to restrict the use of products containing biocides .
i can , in general , support these ideas , which are completely in line with the fifth action programme in the environmental sector .
the aim of the proposal is therefore not to draw up an overall strategy for their use .
in this connection i can announce that the commission has embarked on an investigation into how we might best achieve a viable use of pesticides in the future .
and then there are a number of supplementary amendments which i shall not comment on further , unless i am subsequently requested to do so .
as regards the amendments to annex 6 , it is the anti-fouling agents in particular which parliament seem to have been interested in .
i will be pleased to admit - and somewhat different opinions have been voiced in the debate - that the commission is favourably inclined towards an exemption .
there was a separate question from mrs kirsten jensen concerning mixing up annex 4 and annex 3 and different statements by the commission in connection with consideration of the proposal .
with these remarks i would again thank you for a very positive reception and consideration of the proposal by parliament .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at noon .
price indication
mr president , although the hour is late i wish to present my report on unit pricing .
and that is also the problem .
there is legislation , but legislation which is too complicated , but at least everyone can agree on the principal .
the attempt has always been made to inform the consumer about prices so that he could make comparisons , but the complex legislation on product series , for example , did not work .
if you establish the principal that you should be able to compare prices , that you want to help the consumer , then you must do it in a perfectly understandable way .
mr president , i do not claim to have invented the simple solution .
it was adopted unanimously .
mr president , what did they want and what do we want ?
we want to put an end to all these complications , we want to stop the endless prolongation of legislation , we want clarity .
and that clarity means trying in principle to indicate the price of the product per unit .
you could no longer see the wood for the trees although i would have happily lived with intelligible series which would also have brought quite a number of environmental advantages .
but that did not happen , mr president , and that is why we now need this transparent solution .
now i do appreciate that this transparent solution could bring a few problems in its wake .
i know that full well .
i have written off that problem .
and then mrs thyssen and a few others , including kirsten jensen , came up with another problem , namely what about the small and medium-sized business .
well , mr president , i am most concerned about them because i also hail from a small village where alas the last corner shop has disappeared .
what has to be done to save the corner shop ?
mr president , we have presented three solutions for that one .
the shopper can read it off the list .
mr president , i moved my seat closer to the centre because at this late hour i think we should all huddle together for comfort .
i do not think this has been the most distinguished evening in the history of parliament .
maybe now we are discussing something which is not so much a columbus egg as a columbus omelette .
we are , at this moment , at this very late hour , trying to decide the strengths and weaknesses of the directive .
i want to congratulate the rapporteur - once again - for coming forward with a measure which has significant benefits for consumers in the european union .
i echo her words of praise for the economic and social committee , from whom i have learnt a great deal in the course of our discussions .
it was only on monday evening that we finally voted in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection - again in a late and hurried fashion .
i want to confine myself to speaking about some of the reservations that were raised then which i hope to put to the commission .
there is a good deal of uncertainty about a number of things : the cost of the equipment , which the small trader will need .
some will go for a list , some may use a price-gun , some may want some computerized system .
finally , there is a difficulty because the price estimates that have been produced by the commission thus far are somewhat at variance with the estimates we have from the retailers themselves .
that is not surprising .
they will sometimes exaggerate and sometimes the commission may underestimate .
but there are differences and we believe that there should be a continuing review of precisely what the price implications will be .
one of mrs oomen-ruijten 's amendments deals with the question of information for the small retailer .
i hope some amendments which have come from our side of the committee will give further reassurance in this matter .
i personally can see no reason why , in that time , the main problems for small traders cannot be met .
it is not our intention to introduce amendments tonight which prevent this directive coming into force , or in any sense allow for the postponement of serious discussion until the next millennium .
i have also offered - it was only been tabled very late on thursday of last week - a new amendment which i have discussed with the rapporteur and which specifically looks at a number of exclusions .
she has indicated general assent with most of these exclusions .
mr president , the two-fold pricing that the commission is proposing is undoubtedly a help for shoppers who want to compare prices .
to that extent the proposal for a directive is to be welcomed .
first of all we have yet another demonstration of how good europe is at paying lip service to small businesses but how difficult it is to help them when it comes down to practice .
some amendments , mr president , offer a glimmer of comfort , but apart from amendment no 5 they are all theoretical .
even amendments nos 7 and 9 fail to convince me .
of course it sounds good to provide financial aid for information brochures for the smus , but small businesses are well able to do their sums and they know that there are such things as pcs .
they do not need information so much as less paperwork .
mr president , my second objection is to the timing .
i fail to understand why this proposal cannot wait until the euro has been introduced as the sole legal tender , to july 2002 .
a regulation which says that three or four prices must be indicated per product , and even up to six or eight for price reductions does not , to my mind , help the consumer a great deal .
mr president , i shall speak briefly only for long enough to thank the rapporteur , mrs oomen-ruijten , for dealing in such a complete and well-informed manner with a matter which is technically not of the simplest .
i think the extra time for technological adaptation is enough .
still , we would ask the commission to make a further effort to accept the amendments presented today , which are those left over from the last draft , voted on monday evening .
thus i think we shall have a directive appreciated both by traders and consumers - and that is not a trifle !
mr president , i wish to congratulate my colleague , mrs oomen-ruijten , on her flexible approach as rapporteur to the subject .
we are used to a different technique from her , especially on drugs , but in this case she has been very flexible .
the group of the european liberal and democratic party welcomes the present directive to replace two old directives for the last two just did not work in practice .
they were based on the idea of standard packages , which the producers could not agree about , which meant that the system of selling products throughout the whole of the union in the same quantities was just impractical .
some colleagues and even the agriculture committee have tried to re-instate the old system .
we reject their attempts to do so , as they have proved not to work .
my question is : when will the commission , when will commissioner bonino , produce the statement on the financial consequences of this system for the retail trade ?
we consider it only logical and reasonable that funds are made available to help the retail trade , with information programmes on the introduction of this new system .
mr president , we would have preferred nothing at all to be laid down in this directive on the transitional period when the euro , not the ecu , is introduced .
that makes it much simpler and i am looking at mrs thyssen .
let us make the new system of pricing , which i support , as easy as possible for retailers to apply .
mr president , some supermarkets already indicate prices per unit .
it does not cost the shop keeper any extra money but it helps the consumer .
that is why i welcome binding european legislation on pricing .
we can happily assume this will be welcomed by consumer organisations .
i wish to pay tribute to the work of the rapporteur , mrs oomen-ruijten .
with her amendments she has improved considerably a number of points of the commission 's proposal .
they may seem trivialities , but this legislation has tremendous repercussions for innumerable shop keepers and consumers .
that is why it is important to word things carefully and define retailers ' obligations .
i think a good balance has been struck for the position of the small business .
i understand that mrs oomen-ruijten is confident that her report will be passed in the final vote .
perhaps the commission 's opinion on the amendments may yet cause her a sleepless night .
be that as it may , i do wish her a good night 's sleep .
she has earned it and to look at her she needs it , and she is not the only one .
mr president , despite the lateness of the hour , i should like to thank the rapporteur for the way in which she has reconciled so many interests - those of the producers , the wholesalers and the retailers .
the point has already been made that the directive allows retailers a period of grace , without in any way affecting the protection given to the consumer .
anyone wishing to breathe life into the section of the eu treaty which refers to a high level of consumer protection must , to my mind , be in favour of this report .
for many products , they cannot see the unit price at a glance .
price transparency does not exist - but that was the aim at european level nearly 20 years ago .
the rules which have applied up to now have no doubt made things better for the consumer in some countries .
personally - and here i am in the same boat as mrs oomen-ruijten - i have found them rather confusing , and quite often simply a puzzle .
if i bought an unwrapped piece of ham , i could see the selling price and the cost per kilo .
if i bought a prepacked item , i could see that there were two pieces , but had no idea how big they were : it would just say 116 grams and the selling price .
i had to work out for myself what the cost per pound or kilo was .
so i am very pleased , no doubt like the great majority of consumers , to see the unit price at last becoming a reality .
it is true , as the rapporteur has explained , that she has tried in various amendments to lighten the burden on small shops .
in her amendment no 14 we read of the possibility of putting up price lists and placards inside shops .
so that would mean that it would be much easier if you went over to a computerized system of pricing .
the net result of this directive , unless the burden on small shops is lightened , will be that small shops either narrow the range of their products or else they go out of business .
i must explain that i believe that amendment no 7 is not possible for the commission to accept .
it would set a tremendous precedent to invent commission support to help pay for the price of the directive .
they cannot all be wrong !
this directive creates real problems for small shops and i hope the commission will address it .
thank you to the rapporteur , thank you to the members who have followed this debate .
i should like to take the cue from come observations made by mrs jackson and make one or two clarifications .
ladies and gentlemen , the commission is not inventing a directive .
of the remaining amendments the commission accepts the great majority and also thanks parliament its effort at clarification through much re-wording which seems to us more appropriate .
secondly , as regards financial support , the commission will draft a report , as requested , but not in a year 's time .
one year is really too short a time to manage to draw up a coherent report .
we therefore maintain our proposal of two years , with a report on the situation as regards entry into force .
but the commission really does not think for the moment that it needs to intervene on financial support , since it has accepted as a compromise a longer period of application .
i am referring for example the antique trade and others , some of which warrants a moment 's reflection .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at noon tomorrow .
( the sitting was closed at 12.35 a.m. )
approval of the minutes
the minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
mr president , in yesterday 's minutes it is recorded that i abstained on amendment no 22 on the oostlander report .
it was my intention to vote for it .
it was a case of mea culpa rather than a faulty machine .
please , could it be corrected .
it will be corrected .
mr president , yesterday i managed to reach the chamber just as the minutes were being agreed - i had been attending another meeting .
had i been here , i would have made a correction .
yesterday 's minutes said that we agreed tuesday 's minutes but in fact tuesday 's minutes were incorrect .
they omitted the reference to my presentation of the discharge report on the general budget and the fed .
it was a 13-minute speech .
i may not be the world 's greatest speaker but 13 minutes is quite a sizeable chunk to miss .
i should be grateful if that could be corrected in tuesday 's minutes .
we take note of that .
( parliament approved the minutes )
mr president , firstly , i regret the absence of mr de silguy , who kindly let me know that he could not be present ; i should therefore like to welcome mrs wulf-mathies .
secondly , i should like to stress the fact that i believe that i have drawn up a consensus report .
i accepted a considerable number of amendments in committee , since i believe that a european parliament resolution on a subject as important as this must be able to count on the support of a substantial majority of members .
in 1995 , for example , the value of transactions on the international foreign exchange market exceeded usd 1300 billion per day - more than twice the total currency reserves of the industrialized countries .
in twelve years , the value of transactions per day has multiplied by a factor of twenty .
the international capital market enables countries with little capacity to generate domestic savings to gain immediate access to external savings - often on exceptionally favourable financial terms .
this allows such countries to finance economic development policies which they would otherwise be unable to fund .
furthermore , we are calling on governments to pursue exchange-rate stability , on the basis of sound monetary and fiscal policies , and to maintain low interest and inflation rates and levels of public deficit .
finally , we are calling for the essential cooperation between the governors of the central banks to be carried out under the auspices of the bank for international settlements .
mr president , this report on the strengthening of world monetary cooperation to ensure better regulation of monetary and financial markets is very timely .
after all , we in europe recognize only too well that activity one side of the world can have profound effects elsewhere , including europe .
the deutschmark interest rate remained high , with enormous knock-on effects on europe 's economy and its ability to climb out of its economic pause - to borrow a phrase favoured by the commission .
if that is true in the europe of today , imagine the situation once the euro has entered the currency markets .
what are we to do in this new environment which will be upon us shortly ?
we will need strong international cooperation , and the newly-fledged european central bank will need to quickly master its global , as well as its local , role .
although the garriga polledo report perhaps underplays the degree of danger unleashed by liberalizing the financial markets , i believe we can support the remedies suggested by the rapporteur .
to these suggestions i would add that the g3 or the g7 should not exclude other important global players , including asia and asean , whose parliamentary representatives are in conclave with euro-mps this morning here in strasbourg .
nor should we fail to remind the financial community of their own responsibilities .
the better they can regulate and monitor themselves , the better we , the politicians , will be satisfied .
the sorry story of barings ' collapse reveals all too palpably human frailty at work .
whatever else is true , it is apparent that the internal checks and balances were not operating successfully between london and singapore .
that brings me back to where i started .
today 's lead story in the financial times reports the imf 's regular world economic outlooks exhortation to germany to cut its interest rates and so boost economic recovery .
we truly live now in an interdependent world and must reform ourselves to meet these new circumstances .
this would be implemented by the use of an early-warning system , relying on the appropriate financing mechanisms and promoting the strengthening of international cooperation .
the operative part of the motion for a resolution contained in mr garriga polledo 's report , the broad lines of which we support , prompts two comments from us .
we therefore need to keep out heads and not put pressure either on the course of events or on the states .
mr president , the rapporteur seems to be relying too much on the assumption that the movement of capital functions best under the current international funding systems .
nor am i sure about the social democrats ' proposal that it would be sufficient to set up an international economic council to monitor speculation .
there is a need for a much more radical change to worldwide funding structures .
at present the sum of money changing hands throughout the world is equivalent to three times the foreign currency reserves of many industrialized countries .
neither any national banks nor their international counterparts are capable of combating this level of speculation .
of course the greens too support the establishment of this type of early warning system and the strengthening of cooperation on international financial policy .
this , indeed , was proposed last year at the halifax summit and this is what the rapporteur is now proposing , but it is really not enough .
there is a need for measures which will automatically prevent speculation , and the speculators must be made to pay for such measures .
the proposal which is urgently needed is to bring into force an international tax on speculation capital .
this was proposed as long ago as 1978 by james tobin , who later won the nobel prize .
even a very low tax , of the order of 0.5 % on the quantity of capital exchanged could have a significant effect on reducing particularly short-term placements or speculation proper .
it will not of course be easy to introduce such a tax , but it should be attempted , with a view thereby to achieving an entirely new system for the supervision of capital movements at global level .
whatever one may think about the bretton woods agreements , the superiority of the dollar as a reference currency for the entire international monetary system was justified on three grounds .
one was political : the united states had just won , and helped the europeans to win , the second world war .
that was an important reason , but it was one born of circumstances , and has now become invalid .
the second reason was economic : the united states were financing european reconstruction through the marshall plan .
here again , they seem to me to be its main beneficiaries , but this reason too has ceased to exist .
the united states abandoned that guarantee on 15 august 1971 .
we even experienced american treasury officials touring europe and saying to the european leaders : ' the dollar is our currency and this is your problem . '
today , these imbalances have become so serious that - while paying tribute to the efforts of the rapporteur - i cannot endorse some of his conclusions , or indeed some of his premises .
in the motion for a resolution , i read this : ' recognizing that the liberalization of capital movements brings enormous benefits , since a free capital market ensures that savings are assigned to the most productive investments ' .
i think , therefore , that we should think carefully . after all , as has just been said , a universal capital taxation mechanism serves a speculative purpose .
we also need to consider what , today , is the justification of credit , and especially short-term credit , and we need to consider a new monetary agreement .
by subjecting the latter organization to that prerequisite this would allow the introduction of a social clause , a clause relating to the placing of export products on the internal market , an environmental clause and a democratic label .
mr president , the garriga polledo report supplies an excellent analysis of the international money markets and their possibilities with regard to regulation , but it also contains a considerable surprise .
it hardly mentions the supposed stabilizing virtues of the single currency at world level .
yet the commission 's arguments always include , prominently faced , a paragraph from which we learn that ' the single currency will contribute to greater worldwide monetary stability ' .
it is hard to understand exactly what this statement is supposed to mean , and the garriga polledo report provides no enlightenment .
the explanatory statement , in fact , contains not a single word on the subject , while the motion for a resolution itself contains one brief reference , which is expressed as a hope rather than an argument .
in order to achieve that objective , there is no real need for the crutch of the single currency - all that is needed is courage and discipline .
on the other hand , the report does in fact disclose a disadvantage of monetary union .
by abolishing exchange rates within the euro zone , it will cause the disappearance of an indicator and the yardstick for the quality of national administration .
mr president , i too am grateful to the rapporteur for this very well presented and very effective report .
it also states that a free capital market ensures that savings are assigned to the most productive investments .
this highlights the need for europe to act .
the second call , to curb the predominance of the us dollar , is without doubt justified , and the single currency might be of assistance here .
it is also important to bear in mind external debt and the developing countries .
i do not think there is any point , in this context , in writing off financial positions as debts which will never be repaid .
overall , therefore , i think the report is a constructive one : it provides a good starting-point for further discussion in the various european forums .
mr president , this report is a most timely one , in that immediately prior to the april meeting of the imf and the world bank , it once again calls for an improvement in international monetary cooperation .
it can thus be said that a new bretton woods system is even more urgently needed now than was the case when it was originally introduced .
because after all , as the report makes clear , the us dollar accounts for 60 % of world currency reserves , which in no way corresponds to the importance of the us economy .
the european parliament has already quite rightly called on the commission several times to produce a white paper on monetary developments .
today we are going further , and also asking for an assessment of the effects of monetary union on the stability of the international financial system .
i therefore believe that we are quite right to call on the commission to carry out further studies in this area .
what is most important of all , however , is to establish a un economic council along the lines of the un security council , in order to institutionalize monetary cooperation .
mr president , in my opinion parliament acted responsibly when it gave the committee on economic affairs the opportunity to draw up this report .
the economic cooperation which has developed has benefited nations and their citizens .
the exchange of raw materials and product information has fostered development .
the use of energy provides a good analogy for this process .
skill in exploiting energy , consumption of and trade in raw materials have benefitted us to a great extent .
only the excessive use of energy and its various forms are causing us problems .
in the same way we may say that the liberalization of capital is positive in itself ; however , the enlargement of foreign exchange markets has assumed ungovernable proportions .
when markets grow twenty-fold in ten years and daily currency movements have doubled in relation to currency reserves , we may guess what type of risks this may bring .
our new technology makes it possible to carry out transactions at the speed of light and when speculations are added to this problem , we are really endangering the conditions for international free trade .
common sense dictates that a change must be made .
it is also clear that the european single currency would facilitate the necessary cooperation with japan and the united states on setting rules for the currency markets .
there is frequent talk of the confidence of the citizen .
this is also an essential condition for all democracy and market economy .
therefore the world democratic governments must bring the currency markets under control .
there is no time to waste ; regulation is needed above all to protect ordinary citizens and their jobs .
their work depends on the real economy , not on speculation .
small businesses in small countries suffer especially from uncertain currency markets .
they do not have the resources or the opportunity to protect themselves .
small countries also have to increase their currency reserves many times over compared to large countries .
emu would in these circumstances be a healthy development .
it would reduce the need for these reserves and yet at the same time could increase creditability .
it is quite true that the regulation and taxation of capital movements need to be harmonised .
if the movement of capital is free , such taxation should be made compulsory .
capital cannot be given a free ride . it must bear the social responsibility of paying tax .
but if progress is to be made in this matter we must also support the single european currency .
only in this way will it be possible to move forward in this area .
mr president , i start by congratulating mr garriga polledo on the very comprehensive and technical report before us today .
the international financial markets now play a very important role in the world economy .
the deregulation of financial markets in many member countries has meant that trillions of pounds and dollars can now flow across international borders to seek a return for those investors .
it is clear that what we need is sustainable positions across the globe whether it is in the united states , europe , japan or indeed in the developing world .
it is clear as well that the actions of the market in the longer term will lead to lower interest rates which will make it cheaper to borrow for investment and in turn will create jobs .
i also accept some of the analysis of mr garriga polledo in terms of the fact that the international monetary system needs rules .
i echo the words of mr r&ouml;nnholm on that .
in order to create those rules it needs an institutional framework .
at the moment , as we see in europe , the bundesbank acts in the interest of the german economy .
we are trying to create a system where we would have a european central bank acting in the interests of the european economy .
we see a similar position with the us , the japanese and the european markets acting to some extent on their own .
what we need is a system which acts in terms of the global interest and international objectives .
the only way we can do that is through rules and through international cooperation .
i also accept some of the assertions by mr garriga polledo about the damage that floating exchange rates can do .
it can cause over-evaluation of currencies .
i believe that the money markets are not necessarily the best judge of real economic performance , as we have seen with the exchange rate mechanism here in europe .
i do not necessarily believe either that intervention is the answer .
what we need is a new direction .
that new direction is cooperation .
we need a framework which will be brought into existence after stage three of monetary union .
i do not necessarily believe , as the rapporteur suggests , that the imf and the world bank are the best institutions to do that .
but i agree that the g7 is not enough .
what we need is to include the fast-growing economies of asia in that process and , at the same time , look at how we can involve the developing world in that process .
we need new multilateral procedures , we need cooperation because the success of the global economy and the livelihoods of many people around the world depend on it .
mr president , at national level we accept that markets cannot function without rules imposed by national government .
whilst national markets still functioned primarily on a national scale this worked well enough .
with the advent of the european single market the ability of national governments to continue imposing their own rules on markets was weakened .
much of the internal market programme was then targeted at reproducing at european level this ability of national governments to set the rules .
on one level , however , the member states were negligent .
when capital movements were liberalized the advice of the european parliament that instruments should be set up at european level to counter any undesired developments was ignored .
with the globalization of capital movements , resulting from the predominance of liberal thinking and technological innovation , a worldwide capital market came into being which knows no rules but its own .
in normal circumstances this seems to work reasonably well .
but when these markets fall prey to speculation , there are manifestly no checks on the system .
the tidal waves then unleashed do great damage to the economy , but governments collectively and the central banks have no power to do anything about it .
the question is , should the political and nonfinancial business world resign itself to this and regard waves of speculation as merely a natural phenomenon , or not ?
my group firmly believes that efforts must be made both to regulate the financial market and to create instruments whereby waves of speculation can be prevented or checked .
the keys to this are closer cooperation between governments , especially those of the three main economic blocs , and the central banks and on the other hand the possible introduction of a tax on capital transactions .
however tricky a tax of this kind might be , its introduction depends primarily on whether or not the necessary political will is there .
pious aspirations about reducing labour costs by taxing less can be realized in this way .
it will certainly be easier than putting a man on the moon and far more useful .
the same cannot be said about the subject of his report , the international financial markets .
the rationale of the markets has almost gone too far .
a few weeks ago , wall street started to fall , not because unemployment in the united states increased but because it fell .
think what would happen to us if unemployment began to fall in europe !
fortunately , our conservative governments , with their employment policies , protect us from any such ill-omened development !
they have created the third world debt disaster .
the deregulated money markets created the slm scandal in the united states , a scandal involving hundreds of billions of dollars that taxpayers had to pay for .
similarly , a year ago they created the mexico crisis even though mexico implemented all the rules they had dictated to it .
and here , european taxpayers have also had to pay their costs .
mr president , in today 's political conditions the major conservative governments refuse to cooperate on monetary issues .
mr president , the commission welcomes mr garriga polledo 's report , which recommends greater international monetary and financial cooperation .
this report has been perfectly timed to support the commission in its efforts to improve international monetary cooperation .
in the commission 's view , and as emphasized by the rapporteur , a stable national economic policy remains a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the stability of the international monetary system .
moreover , while the markets serve a useful purpose in imposing discipline , they can have destabilizing effects which need to be offset by international cooperation .
in the short term , this is above all a matter of improved monitoring and the creation of crisis prevention mechanisms .
in the longer term , institutional reforms are needed to make it easier to step up international cooperation and enhance the coordination of macroeconomic policy .
the commission is therefore in favour of increased cooperation between the international institutions .
one of the major challenges for international cooperation in the future will be to take more account of the interdependence not only between countries , but also between their policies .
the house is also calling for the european union to play a greater role in international cooperation and , via the commission and the european central bank , to become a full member of the international institutions concerned .
the commission is willing to assume this role .
the question of international cooperation in the monetary arena must also be considered in the light of monetary union , which will have far-reaching consequences for the international monetary system .
it should be stressed here that the introduction of economic and monetary union should considerably improve international monetary cooperation .
in this way , the union would also be in a better position to coordinate monetary policy with its international partners and to bring about a reform of the international monetary system .
to achieve this , however , the european union must adopt a firm and steadfast attitude towards its partners .
it also remains to be decided how the monetary union could and should be represented in the international institutions .
until such time as a new framework for international monetary and financial coordination has been defined , however , it would seem premature to comment on a financial support mechanism to minimize exchange-rate fluctuations .
finally , as far as financial monitoring is concerned , the commission will continue to carry out its existing responsibilities .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place today at 12.00 .
the next item is the report ( a4-0073 / 96 ) by mr walter , on behalf of the committee on regional policy , on economic and monetary union and economic and social cohesion .
mr president , commissioner , the development of the european union has until now revolved primarily around progress in the economic sector , and the moves towards economic and monetary union represent another important milestone on this road .
and yet , if the nations of europe are to continue to coexist in peace , they must be guided by more ambitious goals .
this includes bringing the eu member states closer together in terms of living standards and opportunities in the various regions .
it will also help to improve the effectiveness of the structural funds , the union 's most important instrument of economic and social cohesion .
it is therefore necessary to draw up a cohesion strategy laying down specific stages , as happened in the case of economic and monetary union .
this will require both the participating countries and the pre-in countries to act responsibly .
secondly , however , we shall need to be supportive of those who are pressing on steadfastly with their sometimes difficult task of meeting the criteria .
this could perhaps be done by means of an extended instrument of solidarity like the new cohesion fund .
we are definitely not thinking here of financial compensation : an equal measure of solidarity must be shown by the ins and the outs .
furthermore , if economic and social cohesion is to make progress , we shall have to define more clearly and realistically than in the past what we mean by cohesion and the adaptation of living standards in the union .
we should consider using less rigid indicators than gdp , as at present : unemployment statistics should be included .
key factors are sustainable growth , changes in economic trends , action to prevent exclusion , and the state of infrastructure , including social and cultural infrastructure .
these indicators should also be used in developing and focusing the union 's most important instrument of cohesion , the structural funds , and the challenges which lie ahead of them .
we should also have the courage to set deadlines by which tangible progress is to be made .
the self-confidence shown when emu was introduced must not be dismissed as unattainable in the case of cohesion .
a true cohesion policy , designed to dovetail with economic and monetary union and to absorb any adverse effects , will entail greater coordination in all policy areas which have a bearing on economic and social cohesion .
in a european union with 17 million unemployed , employment policy must take top priority .
we are therefore calling for an explicit article on employment to be incorporated into the maastricht treaty .
an active , sustainable environmental policy must also be put in place : a healthy environment will make a major contribution to the quality of life in the regions and their attractiveness .
in terms of social policy , everyone must pull together to avoid the distortions caused by social dumping - and i say everyone , to include in particular the country which has until now been opting out .
if we add cross-border regional planning , a coherent european industrial and research policy , and the safeguarding of public services which are accessible to all , what emerges is a cohesion policy worthy of the name .
europe will have a bright future if it can combine solidarity with reliability .
policies to create economic and social cohesion will be the litmus test of a peaceful and united europe .
on the other hand , such short- and medium-term considerations may well have to take account of distortions or even disruptions of the internal market .
it has to be said , however , that adverse effects on employment certainly do not occur in one direction only .
we experienced this in austria when , in 1995 , our italian neighbours devalued the lira .
it was not the case that adverse effects on employment were immediately felt in italy - far from it .
austria , a country with a hard currency , was the one to suffer , when millions of schillings ' worth of purchasing power poured into italy from austria .
all i am saying is that there is no one-way street here and no automatic response , but that the effects are of many kinds and must all be taken into account .
none of this goes far enough .
secondly , when overhauling the structural funds , i think it is important to focus on projects which are needed in order for countries not yet taking part in monetary union to meet the convergence criteria .
and thirdly , private investment must be stimulated , since this alone can create truly secure jobs .
the reason we wanted this was because in all the discussions we have had on emu and the single currency , member states and experts simply have not dealt with the regional issues .
people in our industrial , declining , peripheral and rural regions need to know that emu will have some benefit for them .
in this report my group has pledged its support for emu .
emu therefore needs to demonstrate that it can support , underpin and promote cohesion .
i wish to emphasize again what mr walter has put into his report .
he is calling for an integrated cohesion strategy which means that we include emu , regional policies and all relevant policies in the processes of cohesion .
he is asking for flanking measures to ensure emu and cohesion come together and we are asking also for a solidarity mechanism to protect the financial markets against speculation and to include countries wishing to come in .
it is a very relevant debate .
president lamfalussy of the emi spoke to parliament 's subcommittee on monetary affairs on monday and presented the annual report .
the word ' cohesion ' did not pass his lips once .
it is disappointing that these issues are not dealt with as a whole and cohesive strategy .
looking at the countries that will join emu from the beginning , it appears that the countries on the outside may suffer punitive actions .
that is why the walter report is such an excellent one , because it puts forward constructive policies on how we can help those countries move into emu and into the third phase faster .
finally , we need to step up our actions in the regions .
we need to reaffirm what was agreed at the european council in madrid .
we need to look at local initiatives , education , training , the organization of working time , promotion of smes ; but above all we need to win the arguments for emu in our regions .
this is why we need an active cohesion policy orientated towards employment and growth .
nominal and real convergence are not two mutually contradictory goals here .
sound public finances , stable prices , low interest rates and a stable exchange rate are preconditions for growth and employment .
emu , with all its advantages - including in particular for social and economic cohesion - is impossible without nominal convergence .
it is therefore clear that a reduction in crippling national debt plays an important role with regard to investment , and thus employment .
practical experience in recent years has shown that where unemployment has been tackled by increasing national debt and raising taxes , no lasting success has been achieved .
only a stable economy , which is the crucial precondition for participating in monetary union , can create market confidence , encourage trade and investment , and hence stimulate growth and job creation .
one of the main challenges at the start of emu will therefore be to define the relationship between the currencies of participating states and those of countries which are not participating .
the walter report explores this problem .
the many amendments tabled by my group have , in my view , brought about some good compromises , even though not all our hopes have been fulfilled .
let me therefore draw particular attention to two points which are of considerable importance to my group .
the first is amendment no 9 on paragraph 22 , in which we state that the current provisions of the treaty are not inadequate and incomplete , but merely need to be strengthened and properly applied .
furthermore , we cannot agree to an economic steering body as a counterpart of the ecb .
we cannot and do not wish to alter the treaty ; otherwise , competition would ultimately be eliminated and the market partially segmented , to the detriment of consumers .
surely that cannot be in our interest .
i would therefore ask the house to vote in favour of our amendment on this specific point .
mr president , madam commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we all know that economic and social cohesion is one of the principles of the treaty .
however , it must be present in all measures taken by the european union , although the most obvious facet of this cohesion tends to be the structural funds .
we must bear in mind that this principle should not be limited to the structural funds but should be applied to all the measures taken by the european union and also to economic and monetary union .
that is the only reason why it was given so much emphasis in the treaties .
on the other hand , we must acknowledge that economic and monetary union is one of the most ambitious projects and perhaps the one with the greatest implications for the european union and its future .
in my opinion , a positive implication .
we have discussed both of these issues many times separately .
economic and social cohesion , on the one hand , and economic and monetary union , on the other .
but we have to see them as interlinked . that is the great merit of this report .
in other words , it has put together these two aspects of european union which we must be capable of reconciling .
we must reconcile the attempt at achieving economic and social cohesion with achievement of economic and monetary union .
that is what we have to do and that is what is imposed upon us by the treaty on european union .
the walter report shows us that this aim is not easy but nor is it impossible .
moreover , if we fail to bring about this reconciliation the effects for the european union will be disastrous .
i therefore congratulate mr walter on his report because i think that it has led to a very positive debate which has been open to all contributions .
with one condition , namely that we actually do so , and in order to do so we must have a concerted strategy .
cohesion and degradation of the environment are equally incompatible .
the confederal group of the european united left wishes to express its concern at the dangers to cohesion which economic and monetary union involves .
the present convergence criteria laid down in the maastricht treaty are neither compatible with the principle of cohesion , nor sufficient .
others must be considered : convergence in terms of unit labour costs , the wage-productivity ratio , and so on .
otherwise - and this is a serious point - the adjustments will be made , and they are already being made , at the cost of jobs .
because , as mr walter points out in his report , the conclusions of the madrid summit and other initiatives may remain empty words if they are not genuinely put into effect .
unfortunately , it is not consistent .
the effects on regional development make the downside of the planned monetary union all too clear .
our role in parliament is in fact to take corrective action , but parliament too is starting to question the original principle of economic and social cohesion .
i indicated during yesterday 's debate on enlargement to the east that the european union is in urgent need of reform .
social and ecological reform would provide an excellent opportunity to bring the economic crisis under control .
i believe that three points should be borne in mind when it comes to meeting the criteria on government debt and net deficits .
firstly , the member states should realize - or be reminded - that the only way to achieve this objective is by means of a judicious savings programme .
thirdly , and quite simply , there must be a guarantee that this single currency will not be imposed against the wishes of the citizens of europe .
i am therefore firmly convinced that any country able to do so should put the question to its citizens in a referendum , to be sure that monetary union meets with the acceptance of europe 's citizens .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , my only purpose in speaking is to congratulate mr walter most sincerely on his excellent report and on the intensive preliminary work which enabled him to reach these conclusions .
economic and social cohesion has always been a community goal , but as mr walter points out , the treaties do not provide us with a clear definition of this concept .
the report raises another issue to which i should like to refer : the impact of future accessions on community regional policy .
mr walter is quite blunt on this point : the future enlargement must , under no circumstances , be carried out to the detriment of the cohesion countries .
in conclusion , i offer my sincere congratulations to mr walter on the content of his report , the working method chosen to draw it up , and the excellent degree of consensus which has been achieved .
mr president , we debated this issue - which deeply concerns us , and is undoubtedly crucial for the future of european integration - for a whole year in the committee on regional policy .
we listened to the views of many authorities in a public hearing and , finally , we adopted almost unanimously the initial report drawn up by mr walter .
as an indication of this unanimity , almost all the speeches that we have heard today have agreed on the fundamental issues .
article 2 of the treaty clearly stipulates that the establishment of a single market and an economic and monetary union must serve to promote economic and social cohesion .
it could not be any other way , and the founding texts and the numerous articles which have enlarged upon them over the years repeatedly refer to this question .
i would point out , incidentally , that the commission unfortunately failed to make any reference to this subject in its report .
so the establishment of economic and monetary union and a single currency is an objective if not of all , then of a broad majority of the members of this parliament .
today , we are fully aware of the social costs of convergence .
on the other hand , however , we have heard no clear explanation of the measures that must be taken to offset those costs .
this not a simple challenge , and meeting it will be fraught with difficulties : but no one said that building europe would be easy .
mr president , commissioner , mr walter 's report is an important one .
i myself am a member of the committee on regional policy and of the committee on economic and monetary affairs and industrial policy in which the report was discussed .
the proposals it contains to counter social dumping and strengthen regional policy and employment policy in order to counterbalance emu are of course good ones .
here , however , i represent opinion in the nordic countries which is critical of emu , mr president .
i myself am against emu - my group holds a different view .
the reason for my critical attitude is that the risks are too great .
emu is a high-risk project , as the walter report makes clear . sweden and the nordic countries are vast areas and already have serious regional problems .
such studies on the effects of emu on these areas , both in the long and the short term , should be conducted before emu is implemented .
for example , what will change for the member states when they become part of emu - if they do so ?
what instruments of control will remain at national level to deal with economic slumps , for example ?
sudden changes in , for instance , the timber industry as a result of lower prices would soon turn into a crisis in sweden and finland .
will countries still be able , at national level , to pursue certain economic policies , interest and exchange rate policies , regional and labour market policies , and so on ?
i doubt it !
it would also be best if the emu project - if it is implemented according to the current timetable - contained a description of the decision-making process .
a final point on this subject : before emu is implemented , if it is , the democratic process must be strengthened in all member states .
i am in favour of referenda as one way of doing this and of improved activities to provide information on the advantages and disadvantages of emu .
the present report should be seen as an initial step towards elucidating the consequences of emu .
it does not call the criteria into question , and goes no further than calling for the adoption of supporting measures to ensure that the economic and monetary union is not prejudicial to economic and social cohesion .
the european commission , for its part , is not prepared to hand out budgetary compensation since it purports to sanction the so-called ' cohesion ' states which fail to meet the convergence criteria .
mr walter 's report falls foul of a substantial obstacle which he cannot overcome : the incompatibility of the single currency with economic and social cohesion .
furthermore , the european social observatory has recently acknowledged that the economic and monetary union model inevitably carries the seeds of social deregulation .
the former chairman of the bundesbank , mr otto p&ouml;hl , for his part recently stated that compliance with the convergence criteria was incompatible with the desire to combat unemployment .
the social unrest in france during november and december opened the way to the financial markets by expressing the workforce 's rejection of a social model based on ultra-liberalism .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this is a crucial issue .
i am deeply sorry that the european parliament excludes the possibility of headto-head discussions in which i , could for example , counteract the opinions of the previous speaker with whom i disagree .
this debate is a series of isolated statements without any real dialogue or thought .
but the walter report is a noteworthy report of enormous lucidity and i am entirely in agreement with it .
a single currency will represent one of the most profound changes which europe has undergone in recent decades .
there will be a ' before and after ' in terms of the single currency .
a new ball game .
and the challenge to the poorer regions posed , in the field of the single currency , an extremely powerful challenge .
the single currency is going to be an important element of the identification of european citizens with the european union .
early on , the union will have to set up a federal-type budget .
the current budget will be insufficient , too limited and restricted in terms of the implications of economic and monetary union .
without such a federal budget the imbalances across the union 's territory might well worsen , especially when we note the so-called asymmetrical shocks which will effect certain countries and regions more than others .
that is why territorial cohesion calls for the continuation of structural policies and this itself calls for a stepping up , rather than a closing down , of structural policies .
with a view to the aim of a single currency , i think we will have to insist on the application of the convergence criteria decided at maastricht .
and we must not do this just because nominal convergence is a prerequisite for the introduction of the single currency .
we must do it because nominal convergence is to a large extent a prerequisite for true convergence .
by improving the health of the weaker economies we help them in the long term to approach the stronger ones .
however , the criteria for achieving nominal convergence , however important they may be , are not enough for the achievement of true convergence .
mr president , there is a risk associated with enlargement , concerning which we all of course agree in principle .
as we know , the igc is not going to consider the problem .
to me , this seems like burying one 's head in the sand , since the problem of own resources and the sufficiency of resources for the policies we announce is an issue of great importance .
we need not only a europe institutionally equipped for enlargement , but at the same time a europe ready to deal with the economic issues raised by enlargement itself .
it is therefore a matter of absolute priority to implement an integrated regional policy , with all the improvements demanded to make it more effective .
nevertheless , there is no going back and , on the contrary , with the approach of the single currency , we shall have to strengthen cohesion policies , as the rapporteur quite rightly suggests in his magnificent report .
it has already been proved that the effort to fulfil the criteria for nominal convergence has negative results for development , reduces the gnp and leads to job losses on a dramatic scale .
yet , the picture of negative consequences is still incomplete .
might it be that the commission and the european parliament too should begin working on such a study ?
mr president , i want to thank mr walter for his report . it contains a lot of ideas and useful proposals .
i think it is a good comment on regional policy and its importance within the european union . economic and social cohesion is what we are trying to achieve with regional policy .
i have never accepted that economic and monetary union is a threat to the peripheral regions , just as i have never accepted that the completion of the internal market was a threat to the poorer peripheral states .
experience has shown that the internal market has helped the poorer and peripheral states to grow .
the gap between ireland and the average european member state has closed by 21 points ; for spain , by 7 points ; and for portugal , by 9 points .
greece is the exception . our colleagues from greece would have to explain to us why it is the exception .
sicily also is an exception , but there is a problem there .
the european parliament is calling on the intergovernmental conference to promote and defend economic and social cohesion as a key element of the european union .
the commission 's position paper of 28 february on the igc , which sets out a clear commitment to a socially responsible model of european society , proves that you have a political ally in the commission .
mr president , first of all i would like to congratulate mr costa neves on his report .
mr president , you have spoken for us all . i too heard a little while ago about what has happened , from mr dimitrakopoulos .
terrorism is to be condemned anywhere in the world , and that is all .
mr pasty , i think this is an issue that should be considered both by the conference of presidents of the political groups and by the bureau .
i would not like to start a debate here , in plenary .
the directive under discussion does not refer to a new sector but forms part of an already existing legal system governing chemical substances and preparations in general .
the increase in the number of biocidal products is alarming .
our dependence on chemicals is a growing cause for concern . only a fraction of the almost 100 000 chemical products on the market have been authorized .
some ecu 400 million is spent on biocidal products and more than ecu 11 billion spent on pesticides each year .
because of the complexity and interdependence of the 20 or so existing directives on chemical products , understanding and interpreting this draft directive is not easy .
given the importance of this issue , and the support of the commission and parliament for amendment no 95 , the spanish socialist delegation will be voting in favour of this report .
the so-called ' biocidal ' products , such as disinfectants , products for treating wood , bird repellents , anti-slug agents , insecticides , etc. , are not ecologically harmless products .
i would like to say at once that i fully endorse mrs kirsten jensen 's reservations regarding the ' automatic ' principle introduced into the directive .
according to the rapporteur , there are at present about a hundred thousand chemical products on the market , very few of which have been authorized under the procedure suggested in the present directive .
the importance of efficient monitoring procedures will be readily appreciated .
we need not only to enable consumers to protect themselves against chemical products whose side effects are little understood , but also to defend nature and wildlife against invasive chemistry .
one of the fundamental principles of the european union is that of subsidiarity .
in order for the union to function effectively and in order for the people of europe to have faith in cooperation , community legislation must concentrate on those problems which national governments can only solve through cooperation .
we believe in principle that this type of legislation should not be the subject of a community directive . the proposed legislation is not needed to make the single market work .
we consider there to be few disadvantages in certain differences existing between member states in this field . where legislation is needed urgently , this should be the concern of each country individually .
in principle we believe that the eu should have nothing to do with issues such as this and that they are best dealt with at national level .
we have , however , chosen to support what is best for the consumer , and have therefore voted for the report .
consumer protection and consumer information are both very important , especially in the internal market .
we have managed to achieve standardized sizes for many products on our markets . consumers benefit from being able to compare them .
this ec-wide harmonization was , moreover , an attempt to reduce the number of bottles in circulation by increasing recycling .
at the time , this was a major cost factor for the wine industry .
not all wines are the same .
i think we have to draw distinctions .
where standard sizes have already been introduced , it will be enough to go on indicating prices for these units .
dual price indications should only be provided when it is objectively possible to compare prices , and therefore helpful for the consumer .
talleyrand said everything which is exaggerated is insignificant .
i have voted for the report . i regard it as a first attempt to illuminate the social consequences of emu .
mr president , i have just voted for this report with the greatest of pleasure . i would remind honourable members that we have had a visit here from a delegation from the ukraine .
politicians are concerned not about whether we will survive a second chernobyl , but only that the west european nuclear industry might not survive a second chernobyl .
we know that west european nuclear power stations are not safe either ; we should therefore have begun by decommissioning our own nuclear reactors .
mr president , i voted against this motion for a resolution because the text allows the western nuclear industry complete freedom to go and carry out cosmetic operations in the countries of the former ussr .
in this connection , let me cite the example of the pressurized water nuclear power station of cattenom , which is in my own region .
the eu should therefore amend the euratom treaty so that the current text relating to supporting civil nuclear power is removed ; the treaty should then promote renewable energy sources which are sustainable in the long term .
it is four years since the baltic sea council was established as a danish-german initiative ( in april 1992 ) .
i have no doubt that the anti-racist jewish leaders would accept this solution of universal citizenship , as the whites did in south africa .
the green group has voted for the joint resolution concerning the baltic sea conference , despite the fact that we regard it as being far too weak in many respects .
the environmental situation in the baltic sea is alarming , not least in respect of exhaust fumes from road transport and the risks from nuclear power stations .
two things must be halted at once : firstly , all efforts to shoot down the middle east peace process through international terrorism ; and secondly , neutral population groups must no longer fall hostage to escalating military confrontation .
madam president , indeed once again there has been a flare-up of the situation in east timor , in relation to indonesia .
i should like to say that the reaction of the police force and regime in indonesia has now gone even further than that to which we were used and what we were already used to was bad .
the next item is the topical and urgent debate on subjects of major importance .
the choice of auschwitz is no accident , since it is the very symbol of the holocaust and more than a million jews were massacred there .
and now we learn that preparations are under way , on the actual site of auschwitz , for the building of a supermarket .
whichever is worse , both are intolerable .
how was it possible that our countries , with their civilization and culture rooted in judaeo-christian values and traditions , could allow the jews of all people to be exterminated on so massive a scale ?
the auschwitz concentration camp , the final resting place for millions of jews , serves both as a memorial and a warning .
here the nameless victims of the totalitarian nazi regime can be remembered with honour and respect .
i am speaking also for the rest of my group when i say that recent events concerning auschwitz shocked us very much .
madam president , there is a great feeling of moral outrage in this parliament at what has happened at auschwitz .
it was only in april last year that we celebrated - if that is the right word - the fiftieth anniversary of the closing of that concentration camp and its liberation .
today we see an entirely different situation of right-wing fanatics bent on demonstrating antisemitism to try to show the world that they are in control and that they are going to close and cover up history .
in a legal sense one can understand the local authority , but in a moral sense there is outrage at what it is trying to do .
it is significant that the president of poland and the government of poland seem to be in conflict with the local authority .
i therefore welcome the fact that our parliament considers it necessary to maintain a duty to commemorate all the victims of nazi barbarity .
madam president , i address the house on behalf of mr donnay , who is not here .
i cannot accept the trivialization of such actions , because it is our duty to keep alive the collective memory , to ensure that such events can never happen again .
we will therefore support the text of the motion for a resolution tabled by all the groups .
the debate is closed .
madam president , once again parliament must come to a decision with regard to most serious events afflicting an african country .
at least two points in the resolution in support of which i am speaking on behalf of the liberal party seem to me to warrant the full attention of the european parliament and other community bodies .
the first concerns the thousands of liberian boy-soldiers who need to be reintegrated into civilian society by means of school , occupational training and if necessary psychiatric help .
we cannot avoid this situation . so let us have the courage to say so openly .
the latest attempt at a cease-fire was on 12 april and it has promptly collapsed .
but those who live in glass-houses should not throw stones .
you will note that the efforts of the world community get less energetic when only human lives are at stake rather than economic interests .
in these circumstances , in which large numbers of refugees are unable to get away from the fighting and have no independent means of support , the number of potential victims of the fighting is enormous .
we totally condemn the savage crimes committed and the taking of hostages in this new round of hostilities .
renewed efforts need also to be made to prevent the delivery of arms and enforce the embargo approved by the united nations .
it is tragic to reflect that a state begun as a homeland for liberated slaves should have degenerated into a hell on earth .
madam president , the civil war in liberia has flared up again for the umpteenth time . a number of warring groups have been responsible for some 150 000 deaths in the seven years since 1989 .
the people of africa do not deserve such suffering , such large-scale and senseless death .
africa does not deserve to be condemned to oblivion , hopelessness , starvation and poverty .
africa and its inhabitants do not deserve to be ruled by corrupt governments which hold sham elections in order to stay in power , by brutal dictators who become rich by consigning their people to poverty .
if action is not taken , other names will be added to those of rwanda , burundi , and now liberia . the acp-eu joint assembly must take rigorous action .
we are now seeing that such a lengthy tradition of democracy has been incapable of stemming the tide of violent reaction . some colleagues have already referred to the problem of youngsters involved in military organizations .
what is even more alarming , if anything , is the fact that these groups have begun to spawn independent gangs of youths who are acting with ruthless violence and are completely out of control .
given these circumstances , we should consider how to enable the aid teams at least to protect themselves and their equipment , so that they too do not fall victim to the mob .
madam president , in monrovia , a week after the sudden flare-up of violence , the capital presents a scene of desolation that grows worse day by day .
how can we not condemn these acts of violence , which to make matters worse are being perpetuated by armed adolescents .
a catalogue of violence , murder , rape , looting and destruction of dwellings - that is the sad picture today .
and yet monrovia had been relatively calm since 1993 and had never experienced this kind of conflagration in six years of civil war .
so what happened ?
the united states , whose historical links with liberia we know , organized the evacuation of foreigners at a cost of millions of dollars .
the americans responded with a literal flood of resources .
five thousand american troops are in the region .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 5.30 p.m .
madam president , i am glad that despite opposition from the european christian democrats we have managed to get tibet put on today 's agenda .
they are needed too because china 's constant refusal to engage in dialogue with tibet damages the relations between the european union and the people 's republic of china .
nor has there been any improvement in relations between china and tibet ; on the contrary .
the genocide which has been going on for 40 years is still in full swing and it is the european parliament 's responsibility to remind the member states , the council and the commission continually of this terrible tragedy .
i am glad that there are members of the ep-china delegation who firmly intend to bring up the subject not only of china 's human rights records but also of the tragedy of tibet .
undersea cables are planned to take power to peninsula malaysia and nobody is really sure if the whole thing is necessary at all .
in the face of massive protest in the 1980s , the project was abandoned in 1990 , and the malaysian prime minister actually said to the world that this was proof that malaysia cares about the environment .
but in 1992 the project was resurrected .
it puts in serious doubt malaysia 's commitment to manage its forests in a sustainable manner .
the resolution goes into much more detail , which we do not have time to deal with in our short speaking-time , but i commend it fully to the house .
madam president , once again , we have to raise the subject of western sahara , the defence of the sahrawi people and their right to self-determination , and the need for the referendum which is being constantly delayed .
madam president , the situation in colombia is deteriorating day by day .
that is nothing new ; you know that from the papers , from television and the radio .
the controversy surrounding president samper is undermining the authority of the government , which has to contend with continuing bloodbaths .
the colombian government must do everything possible to halt the spiral of violence , human rights abuses and other activities which undermine the rule of law .
instead the government must bring those responsible for the killings to justice and take responsibility itself for seeing that human rights are upheld by the forces of law and order .
only if the government itself shows respect for the rule of law can it persuade others to do likewise .
madam president , i want to speak on the motion on patrick kelly , which is a resolution before you under the human rights heading .
patrick kelly is an irish citizen who is a prisoner in northern ireland and who is suffering from cancer and is critically ill .
the resolution requests his transfer on humanitarian grounds to portlaoise prison where he will be nearer to his family . he has only seen his three-yearold daughter a few times since she was born .
in view of the convention and his rapidly deteriorating health i call , on behalf of the socialist group , for his immediate transfer in the interests of justice and decency .
we are joined in this request by politicians from parties in northern ireland and the republic of ireland , including colleagues from the irish labour party who have visited mr kelly on numerous occasions .
a petition has been signed for his transfer by 85 % of members of the irish parliament , including dick spring , the t&aacute;naiste and minister for foreign affairs .
in conclusion , i want to point out that no logical or legal impediment exists to prevent mr kelly 's transfer to portlaoise prison .
i would ask all members of the house to support the motion .
madam president , i wish to add my voice to the views expressed by my irish colleagues in requesting the early transfer of patrick kelly from the prison in northern ireland to a prison in the irish republic .
i believe that there are powerful humanitarian and compassionate reasons for this request ; reasons that will surely convince the british authorities to allow him to be transferred to a prison near his family .
transferring mr kelly to a prison which is in the jurisdiction of the republic of ireland would be clearly of great benefit to him and greatly alleviate the anguish being felt by his family .
bearing these factors in mind , i urge the british authorities , in a spirit of compassion and humanitarianism , to accede to the request for mr kelly 's transfer .
there is growing support for such a move .
political parties in the republic of ireland and in northern ireland are very supportive .
i hope that my british colleagues in parliament would acknowledge the importance of this matter and would also lend their support .
it is overwhelmingly evident that the case of patrick kelly meets these humanitarian requirements .
madam president , i welcome the fact that this resolution is on the agenda today . britain has ignored calls from all sides , both north and south , on the kelly issue .
kelly is a 44-year-old prisoner who is seriously ill . i do not think it is very good for the peace process in northern ireland to take this approach .
the home secretary , michael howard , is an absolute disgrace for refusing to transfer somebody who is seriously ill .
it is absolutely disgraceful that one person is treated in one way and another in another , particularly taking into account that patrick kelly was sentenced to 25 years for conspiracy .
conspiracy , do not forget , is not when a crime is committed but when a person conspires to commit a crime . some people have serious doubts about this kind of conviction .
in addition , he was denied medical treatment for over a year .
the british authorities were aware of the fact that the skin cancer that kelly had could reoccur .
it was over a year afterwards , and only after appeals from the irish government , that they gave him access to a cancer specialist . this did not need to happen .
it is very important in future that this does not happen . that is why we have two amendments down to this resolution .
we do not think it is strong enough . we would like the fact that he was denied treatment to be recognized and that it should not happen to any other prisoner .
secondly , we would also like to see the european parliament playing a much stronger role in relation to human rights abuses within the european union .
i do not think that britain is respecting its responsibilities under the european convention on the transfer of sentenced prisoners because this convention actually provides for transfer of prisoners for humanitarian reasons .
patrick kelly is a prime example of humanitarian reasons .
madam president , the convention on the transfer of sentenced prisoners is in force throughout europe and is being extensively used .
all applications between ireland and the uk are being looked at on humanitarian grounds . this is one of the key grounds on which transfer requests are made .
prisoners have to be treated as prisoners and patrick kelly was found in possession of a considerable amount of explosives .
this could be achieved either by way of transfer to irish jurisdiction , which the irish government has repeatedly requested , or by a decision by the british authorities to release him on compassionate grounds .
every case is special . patrick kelly 's association with events in northern ireland makes his proposed transfer perhaps more sensitive than most .
if we are to have a successful outcome to the proposed negotiations on 10 june , i believe that the transfer of mr kelly will be a crucial issue in the outcome and success of these talks .
the recent aggression against taiwan has also caused many asian countries to rethink their policy on china .
i have never as yet heard anything like that said about china , so there is a bit of a double standard here .
but if investors are backed by the criticism of 15 member states the country concerned will have to take that on board sooner or later .
i was present at the opening of the academic session of the europe china business school in shanghai .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i am speaking as chairman of the interparliamentary delegation for relations with china .
the european parliament , as we have seen , has reason to be concerned for the fate of this seriously ill man , patrick kelly , who as we have heard is a detainee in northern ireland .
it ought to be possible to separate he fate of this sick man from the controversy - to put it mildly - which surrounds the irish peace process .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , formally speaking colombia is a democracy but as we all know , the rule of law does not operate normally there and there are regular violations of human rights .
i would find it most regrettable if all the amendments aimed at changing it were accepted , because the resolution would then lose its importance .
the tibetan question has been raised here on more than one occasion , including that of a visit by the dalai lama himself .
has that ever cut any ice with china ? on the contrary , it seems that the policy of genocide against tibet continues unabated and with no less brutality .
she was arrested on 10 october 1992 for having taken part in a peaceful demonstration in smana calling for the right of self-determination . what we are entirely free to do here leads to being arrested there .
both we and the un should take up this case . the peace process must be supported here , and the matter brought before the 52nd session of the un commission on human rights which is currently taking place .
successive governments have offered these armed groups the possibility of dialogue and reintegration into the political process .
and thirdly , we cannot address the subject of colombia without mentioning the drug cartels .
there is frequently close cooperation between the guerilla groups and the drug traffickers , and there are often violent clashes between the different criminal organizations .
in any event , we must not forget that the political situation in colombia is currently in a particularly delicate phase .
now more than ever , therefore , we must be aware of the need to defend and support the democratic institutions and the rule of law in colombia .
mr president , a few words on china to begin with , since so many speakers have talked about china .
thank you , mr van den broek .
mr president , the g7 + 1 summit is taking place today in moscow on disarmament matters .
in a world ravaged by terrorism it does not take much imagination to realize the kind of world disasters into which such a trade might lead us .
thus it is our fervent hope that this point too may be considered at the g7 + 1 summit in moscow .
mr president , we have too few reasons for satisfaction in this house not to emphasize those we do have .
well , the year 1996 could be a decisive year for the decline of the detestable ideology of military strength based on nuclear power .
finally , let me return to the blatant proposal by mr chirac , a few months ago , that france 's nuclear resources should be employed in the services of the defence of europe .
we should be glad to obtain further details of his idea , and especially to know how it would fit into the institutional structure of the union .
following the assent of france , the usa , russia and the united kingdom it is very important that the momentum should be sustained .
the peaceful nuclear testing which china wants are undesirable .
the door must remain closed to nuclear testing . we must press china hard to abandon her isolated position or there is the risk that the ctbt may not be concluded by the end of 1996 .
mr president , one of the important points with regard to stopping the spread of radioactive materials is of course to get a grip on the unprecedented problems which exist in the former soviet union .
numerous petitions and resolutions have been drawn up urging his release , signed by the former president of the commission jacques delors , among others .
this parliament , which represents the citizens of europe , is directing a renewed plea to this effect to the participants in the g7 + 1 conference , and to all politicians .
the european parliament is launching a powerful appeal to this effect to the conference on disarmament .
our thanks to the european parliament , mr president , for reminding us today of the importance of a successful outcome to the moscow summit which president santer is attending on behalf of the european commission .
the first priority is safety . the safety of existing nuclear facilities must be improved and those which cannot be brought to a sufficiently high standard of safety must be closed down .
thank you , commissioner .
there is still hope , however , mr president - hope that the efforts now being made will result in a permanent peace in bosnia even after the withdrawal of ifor .
nevertheless , we are very concerned about the situation in kosovo . everything is going in the wrong direction there at present .
verwoerd , malan and other apartheid leaders have found keen followers among the serbs in kosovo , among the minority who with the assistance of police violence and discrimination hold the ethnic albanian majority in an iron grip .
how long can we expect the albanians to put up with being cruelly oppressed and humiliated ? what will happen when the bomb goes off ?
parliament 's recommendations to the council of ministers on the former yugoslavia can be summarised as two points .
put pressure on serbia now and convene an international conference on the future of kosovo as soon as possible .
mr president , in november of last year i was approached during the osce meeting in warsaw by a man from kosovo who was of albanian extraction .
so it is crucial to this area 's development that belgrade should begin talks with the elected representatives of kosovo .
my group regards this as an important prerequisite before the eu restores diplomatic ties with yugoslavia and lifts the economic sanctions which are still in force .
consequently it is regrettable that a number of eu member states believe that the time is right to recognize yugoslavia .
in general many obstacles remain to recovery in yugoslavia .
in short , things are not looking good . the council and commission thus need to keep their finger firmly on the pulse .
a second aspect of the resolution relates to the fact that an increasing number of western governments , apart from the usa , are recognizing serbia-montenegro .
i find this reckless , or short-sighted to say the least . what other pressure can we exert to compel belgrade to solve the kosovo question once and for all ?
i do not wish to reply to mr alavanos ; there is no point . i would merely ask you to ensure that all members are treated in the same way as myself , that is all .
mr alavanos was allotted one minute and spoke for two . i am sorry , but that must not happen again .
mrs pack , i have never cut a speaker off during his or her speech . i simply confine myself to indicating - albeit quite forcefully - when a speaker 's time is up .
always as far as the former yugoslavia is concerned , i have learnt , during this parliament or the previous one , that it was difficult to swim against the tide of the prevailing ideas .
however , i do not allow that to discourage me .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
the topical and urgent debate on subjects of major importance is now closed .
are you asking for the quorum to be established , mr pasty ?
i am not asking for that , i am simply saying that no quorum exists .
in any event , mr pasty , let me thank you for your observations . at the same time , however , i must tell you that they will have absolutely no effect on the result of the vote .
if at some time you wish to initiate a debate on that subject , there are ways in the house for you to do so .
i should like to begin by congratulating him , since i believe that he has drawn up a considered , objective and unbiased report on the very important subject of the implementation of the structural funds in 1994 .
madam president , cohesion is more correctly referred to as economic and social cohesion .
however , even a microscope will hardly reveal the social element of projects funded from the cohesion fund .
if we are wondering how to set about reforming the structural policy , the cohesion fund springs to mind .
i am of the opinion that we should come out clearly against preserving the convergence criteria for structural policy purposes , because for social and economic cohesion to be undermined by convergence criteria is counter-productive .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur , mr costa neves , on his excellent report .
madam president , despite solemn promises i have not received a swedish translation . i regret this and am therefore compelled to read out the text which my colleague mrs wulf-mathies drew up in german .
secondly , the ' polluter pays ' principle forms the basis of action in the environment sector .
the crops used to manufacture drugs are cultivated primarily in three areas : in the andean countries , the countries which form the ' golden crescent ' , and the countries of the ' golden triangle ' in asia .
europe realized too late in the day the need for joint measures to combat the drugs problem , and we are still being too tentative .
not only must we act together in europe , but we must also cooperate with the united nations , taking account of the relevant international conventions and ensuring at last that these are enforced much more strictly .
so how should the resources from this budget line be spent ? the european parliament created the budget line ' north-south cooperation in the campaign against drugs and drug addiction ' in 1987 .
but this could serve as a model for the use of funds from other eu sources - such as the european development fund and laa programme resources - so that other countries can follow our lead .
the commission proposes that initiatives could be funded under the undcp programme in particular , for example aid to monitor and combat the drugs trade .
after all , what could be more praiseworthy than the desire to finance projects for north-south cooperation in the campaign against drugs and drug addiction , in order to make the developing countries more aware of these problems .
however , although we believe that it is necessary to help those countries , the draft which is proposed to us today leaves us sceptical .
first , it is inconsistent . parliament has on several occasions expressed its opinion as to how the campaign against drugs should be conducted , especially at international level .
we regret the fact that this proposal takes insufficient account of that opinion , and that it refers only to the united nations international drug control programme .
the commission maintains that measures against drugs have in fact been unsuccessful so far .
ideally the european union needs to appreciate that cooperation on measures to combat drugs should be born of broad cooperation on measures to foster a good civilian society in its partner countries .
that of course is a long job .
on this issue the committee has received a number of opinions from several other committees with relatively mixed results .
it would be naive , however , to believe that the eu can replace all drugs with other crops and simply buy solutions to the problem . this is unrealistic .
we can provide development aid , set a good example and contribute to development activities to create better infrastructure .
the problems involved are massive and we cannot solve them through resignation ; rather we must counter them with greater efforts and endeavours .
we therefore expect the intergovernmental conference to find much more effective ways of taking decisions where drugs trafficking is concerned . after all , we cannot then take a retrograde step in this connection .
i welcome the humane viewpoint which i believe permeates both the proposal and the report .
the proportion of heroin addicts in the region is increasing ; it exceeds the national average by 15 % . multiple addiction is spreading .
it is essential now to devise a plan for global action . first , greater cooperation between the member states is necessary to ensure better comprehension of mutual problems and the harmonization of policies .
we cannot organize the coexistence of such different models as those that exist at present . secondly , we need to reinforce the health programmes and information campaigns .
at the same time , however , i believe that we must address the serious problem of drug addiction from many different angles and without preconceptions .
generally speaking , we are in favour of mr liese 's report . but we fail to understand why he has suddenly developed such an admiration for trade preferences .
basically , these benefit only large concerns , whereas small farmers gain absolutely nothing .
unlike the opinions delivered by other committees his report provides a balanced account and has avoided the temptation to make unduly forthright comments about liberalization and legalization .
because that is not what we are about here .
we must not forget that the growing of narcotics is often the result of a deeper underlying problem , poverty .
there are no signs at present that the european union , or the member states , intend to pursue this line .
that failure is derived from certain economic laws which apply also to the narcotics sector .
in the proposal under consideration the importance of the system of generalized preferences is confirmed .
between 40 and 50 million people are addicted to illegal drugs . in recent years the number of drug addicts has increased dramatically in developing countries too .
the commission welcomes the report from mr liese and the excellent work done by the committees concerned . to a large extent it corresponds with the analysis and guidelines proposed by the commission .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this is the international decade for the prevention of natural disasters , which will end in the year 2000 .
and since 1984 , the european parliament has delivered a number of opinions in favour of the introduction of more effective measures , especially in the field of prevention .
madam president , the proposal for a decision now before the house on the extremely important subject of civil protection is vague and inadequate , despite the rapporteur 's courageous attempts to improve it .
i am therefore proposing that the intergovernmental conference should address this issue , and i thank mrs gonz&aacute;lez &aacute;lvarez for her comments concerning my amendment .
this was the thinking behind the existing activities , and in my opinion it should be maintained in principle .
in the past , there has always been a good deal of interest in the transfer of know-how .
madam president , i welcome the proposed action programme on civil protection .
it has been a long time coming - probably because the treaty as we have already heard does not provide specific powers to act in this area .
the programme had to be put forward under the general article 235 .
we can only hope it will not suffer the blocking fate of the poverty programme and the action for the elderly programme which are under this legal base .
i am proud to support the london fire service , the largest and probably the best in the world .
i understand from a well-intentioned leak that today is the birthday of the chairman of the ppe .
i will take this opportunity to offer him , on your behalf , our very best wishes .
thank you for your good wishes , and thank you all for your kind thoughts .
many thanks .
madam president , i would like to draw attention to a somewhat regrettable misunderstanding which occurred yesterday .
and in drawing attention to it , i hope that something or other may be done so that it does not occur again .
i had a group of visitors who were sitting up in the gallery , and i was going to show them around parliament .
our agreement was that they were to send me a note when they had finished in the gallery , so that i could be called from the chamber where i was voting .
however , i never received the note in question , and it was only an hour and a half later when the group of visitors was about to leave , that i caught up with them .
in the meantime the danish head of the visitors ' service had been summoned .
that means that the group were given the impression that i had not been here , that i was not doing my job , and that i could not be got hold of .
the long and the short of it is that i was not able to show the group around parliament at all , but only found them five minutes before they were due to leave the place .
i think that this is highly regrettable , and i cannot understand why the note was not passed to me , and why it was said that i was not here .
i would , at any event , like to be assured that such a thing does not happen again .
one might be waiting for some very important messages sitting here in the chamber .
mrs sandb&aelig;k , i have read about this incident and the misunderstanding that occurred .
approval of the minutes
the minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
as regards the resolution on tibet , my name does not appear although i did vote in favour , by roll-call vote .
that error will be corrected , mr caudron .
are there any other comments ?
( parliament approves the minutes )
madam president , this morning i was presented with a hotel bill for the week of this session , and the price was almost 25 % higher than in march .
i have heard that all the hotels in strasbourg have introduced this special price for the weeks when parliament is in session .
would the bureau please try to persuade the competent authorities to break this price cartel and , if necessary , impose fines on those concerned .
as an immediate measure , i would suggest that during those weeks when we meet in strasbourg , we should not meet here in the palais but at the espace leopold building instead .
by so doing we shall show that we are not prepared to be held hostage by these people who are forcing prices up .
mrs gebhardt , that was not a point of order , but as you can imagine i was listening very attentively .
votes
i voted against the gonz&aacute;lez &aacute;lvarez report , in the first place because i do not subscribe to the proposals it contains .
in the amendments attention is called in particular to the ultraperipheral regions of the union .
i see no good reason why this primarily requires european interference .
but what is more important is that i am against the commission proposal as such .
the proposal is based on article 235 of the treaty , the article which provides a legal basis for actions unconnected with the objectives of the treaty .
my group thinks that civil protection is an activity which the member states can well handle for themselves .
even more important , very often protection of the population is in the hands of large numbers of volunteers .
that alone indicates that one must be careful about european interference .
this statement contains no approach or analysis of the great variety of the different types of risk of extraordinary seriousness to which our countries and regions are subjected .
we all know what they are and we have suffered the harmful effects of many of them .
costa neves report
assistance to nis and mongolia
these are problems whose importance cannot be too highly estimated , namely the tacis regulation concerning the states of the former soviet union and mongolia .
we are of the opinion that , because of these various procedural shortcomings , it would have been entirely possible , on our side as well , to have dealt with the matter at greater length .
this fresh start , however , is once again gravely at risk .
consequently , in our amendments we have laid special emphasis on one specific area .
i am particularly happy about the fact that in committee there was a large majority in favour of two amendments which i believe are of particular significance .
in other words , these countries are , to an increasing extent , becoming donor countries too .
i think that it is very important to encourage and intensify this process .
these countries will thus be acting as bridges .
therefore this report has been deliberately arranged along regionalistic lines .
madam president , the problem with the tacis regulation is not a new one .
we have examined this problem and made a start on tackling it , and i hope that this time we shall be more successful .
the problem lies with the council of ministers .
moreover , the tasks are structured in such a way as to ensure that funding goes entirely to problematical projects such as nuclear safety or infrastructure on the one hand , and to western advisers on the other .
a further difficulty will lie in the fact that these are western advisers , with the result that russian , mongolian or kalmuk advisers will not be taken into consideration at all .
there is an enormous problem here .
however , we as a parliament must of course attempt to do something about it .
however , i have a problem with his argument that we should simply use the traditional structures .
we should like to offer this option to those people who live in traditional structures , but we also want to encourage the new , emancipating , democratic structures that are also developing in these countries .
madam president , i too would like to thank the rapporteur , mr pex , for his excellent report .
for reasons that are well known to us , the restructuring process in these countries is taking very much longer than expected ; certainly it is being obstructed often enough .
it is particularly important to give the people a new feeling of self-worth and of confidence in their own capabilities .
i know what i am talking about , because i was fortunate enough to run a bilateral aid programme for three years , assisting with education and further training for specialists and managers in those countries .
there is no doubt that , in future , the aid should be accompanied by more critical comment , and this is a task for the commission in particular .
it remains to be seen , however , how this can be achieved in practice .
it also seems to me rather important that there should now be some coordination in bilateral aid schemes between different countries , where those aid schemes have the same intentions and development areas .
this has happened all too rarely in the past , but it is very useful as a means of pooling resources and avoiding duplication of effort .
i am very pleased about the passage in the council 's draft which lays down that it should not always be the same experts who are involved .
mr elchlepp , i believe this is the first time you have spoken in this house .
please , therefore , accept my warmest congratulations .
madam president , on behalf of the commission i would first like to thank parliament for the fact that the members agreed to deal with this topic under urgent procedure .
parliament has been of considerable assistance in ensuring that this reconsultation proceeds rapidly and constructively .
i would especially like to express my gratitude for the speed with which the report has been drawn up .
as you all know , the period of validity of the previous tacis regulation expired at the end of 1995 .
since then the commission has been forced to operate in a legal vacuum .
the vote today is therefore an important step towards a stable framework for our medium-term planning .
it will also enable us to implement the programme for 1996 .
the commission submitted an initial proposal for a new tacis regulation as early as april 1995 .
parliament delivered its opinion on it in time , in november 1995 .
the council , however , modified the proposal in respect of a number of crucial points .
the commission therefore considered that it was necessary for parliament to be consulted again .
to summarise the council 's new proposal briefly , it can be said that some of the ideas which parliament put forward in its opinion in november 1995 have already been incorporated .
for example , the proposal gives greater priority to the environment , permits combined financing through interreg and tacis and provides for the regulation to have a limited period of validity .
other important changes include the conditions relating to contracting procedures and the conditions for the implementation of the programme .
the commission is able to accept these amendments because they entail a reasonable institutional balance while at the same time maintaining the conditions for the effective administration of the tacis programme .
the new text will also improve the necessary openness of the programme .
most of the new provisions are intended to formalise the procedures which have been applied up to now .
the commission considers it a positive step that these are now being given a more formal basis .
both these changes are in response to repeated requests from recipients .
they also meet other objectives which are clearly in the interests of the european union .
financing through the provision of capital will make it possible through tacis to promote industrial cooperation between small and medium-sized businesses in the eu and their counterparts in the nis .
it is important to give tacis the opportunity to finance small-scale investment in infrastructure .
one of the aims of cross-border cooperation is after all to remove bottlenecks at frontiers , to increase trade and transport across borders .
it is also a question of fostering cross-border cooperation between the eu and the nis and between countries in central and eastern europe and the nis .
the new regulation means that political conditions may be attached to aid .
consequently , respect for human rights and democratic principles has been given a more prominent place in the new regulation .
the commission accepts by far the largest proportion of the amendments tabled by parliament .
i understand that you would like to retain the possibility of resources being earmarked for technical assistance on the one hand and infrastructure and capital provision on the other .
we also find it difficult to approve certain proposals in connection with open tendering procedures as this would extend the implementation of the programme still further .
as regards institutional aspects , the commission believes that the retention of a management committee in the proposal would be a good compromise between the position of parliament and that of the council .
as regards the political conditions , it is the commission 's intention that the european parliament will be informed as quickly as possible if the commission temporarily suspends a programme on account of serious violations of human rights .
it is our express intention to continue the modus operandi vis-&agrave;-vis parliament introduced with regard to chechnya when procedures in connection with the interim agreement with russia were frozen in january 1995 .
madam president , in sum we have every reason to be satisfied with the results of our joint efforts .
this is especially crucial for russia , which is approaching important crossroads .
the debate is closed .
we shall now proceed with the vote .
madam president , a slight error has crept in .
in committee , ms schroedter used the expression ' indigenous peoples ' , which i continued to use .
the original text was in german , but it has now been translated into other languages , and the expression ' native peoples ' has been used .
in german , however , this expression has unfortunate overtones , although as far as content is concerned it means something similar .
i entirely share that sentiment , and we will endeavour to find the most appropriate way .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i wonder whether the commission is able to make its statement now .
a while ago , when voting began there were nearly 200 of us here .
now there are about 40 .
mr fabre-aubrespy , i think that , as this statement is so important , members will remain until this matter comes up in the order of business .
it would not be polite to those members whose reports are to be considered first to change the order of business , and i must refuse to do so .
if any one else raises a similar point , i can tell you quite simply that i shall not be able to act on it .
we will therefore adhere to the order of business .
interim agreement with kazakhstan
this text is very important for kazakhstan , which has suffered from the breakup of the former soviet union , with severe damage to its trading system and its supply network .
in political terms , the agreement covers respect for democracies , the principles of international law and human rights , and the establishment of a political dialogue and cultural cooperation .
the economic and commercial aspects relate to trade in goods subject to mostfavoured-nation treatment .
coal and steel occupy an important place in this partnership agreement , while trade in textile products is the subject of a separate agreement .
the provisions affecting business and investment govern the field of employment as well as the establishment and operation of companies .
economic cooperation extends to the industrial sector , the promotion and protection of investments , and the strengthening of education and training in the widest possible range of areas .
further elections took place on 5 and 9 december 1995 .
the delegation of european parliament observers deemed that these elections were such as to form the basis for the formation of a democratic parliament .
there is thus no further obstacle to reconstruct a partnership , and it is therefore possible to pronounce in favour of concluding interim agreements with kazakhstan , as requested by the committee on external economic relations .
madam president , the partnership and cooperation agreement between the european union and kazakhstan was in fact signed on 23 january 1995 .
the political events which followed that signing , and in particular the dissolution of the kazakh parliament by president nazarbaev , lead our parliament to suspend the procedure for ratification of that agreement until general elections were held .
the first stage relates to this interim agreement which we are to approve today , although parliament 's opinion on the matter is of only very limited relevance .
the committee on foreign affairs considers that we should give a favourable opinion , and that is my personal opinion also .
the economic issues are important , and it would not be appropriate to delay the cooperation envisaged in the interim agreement .
however , this opinion will be without prejudice to the final position we adopt on the main agreement , that is to say the partnership agreement itself .
the facts are that the economic situation in kazakhstan is still poor , the social situation is serious , or even tragic , and above all the political situation has once again become tense just recently .
human rights are not respected , and president nazarbaev seems almost insensitive to western criticism .
but we shall see what we shall see .
for the present , the committee on foreign affairs shares the point of view of the committee on external economic relations and approves the interim agreement .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the agreement with kazakhstan is often discussed purely from an economic viewpoint .
in reality , it is not only the economic aspect that plays an important part - and in that respect kazakhstan has a great future ahead of it - but the political aspect is also very important .
in fact , kazakhstan is a country that one might almost describe as explosive .
moreover , there is no doubt that the most dynamic countries have already become interested in the country .
it is therefore of very great importance to the community that we should set an example as far as kazakhstan is concerned .
i admit that there are endless problems : social problems , employment problems and , last but not least , a relatively weak democracy .
as far as president nazarbaev himself is concerned , he has been very strongly criticised .
however , i should just like to say one thing : the man is , after all , a turk .
recent events in particular have shown us that we must be careful here , and that in consequence a sign from us to president nasarbajev would be of great political advantage to political stability in central asia .
madam president , may i take this opportunity to wish mr martens many happy returns of his birthday today .
but now about kazakhstan .
if you look at european interests in kazakhstan , they are naturally not insignificant .
we rather like the idea of the reserves of oil and gas there and large-scale european undertakings are already busy making sure that they have the opportunity to exploit them .
finally in kazakhstan we also have philip morris , who has taken over the cigarette industry .
finally i should like to say something about energy , because the interim agreement too touches upon nuclear safety .
kazakhstan is actually a country which could manage very well without nuclear energy .
i would rather see social security in kazakhstan put before our trade and economy .
the report is to be welcomed , because the current economic situation in kazakhstan , as has already been mentioned several times , must be regarded as very bad to catastrophic .
mr von habsburg has just given a very graphic description of the situation , particularly with regard to fundamentalism .
this will only be possible , however , if there is a comprehensive economic stabilization of the country , particularly by reducing the rate of inflation .
otherwise , the creation of added value , and with it long-term economic recovery , will be almost impossible .
if the agreement is to be of benefit to both sides , the interim agreement must be accompanied by macroeconomic aid measures .
in any case , however , kazakhstan must be willing to make the effort itself .
where there is political uncertainty , one can more or less rule out any hope of foreign investors committing themselves to any great extent .
so even the planned privatization of formerly state-owned undertakings would only be successful if this political climate were stabilized .
madam president , the interim agreement between the european union and kazakhstan makes it possible for us rapidly to put into practice the intentions of the partnership and cooperation agreement on trade and trade-related issues .
i would stress that partnership and cooperation agreements , and especially those parts relating to trade , are a key instrument in our policy towards the countries of the commonwealth of independent states , cis .
it constitutes a general framework for our future relations with these countries .
i would particularly like to thank mr chesa for an excellent report .
my colleague , commissioner van den broek , has recently visited alma-ata and tashkent and studied the situation in kazakhstan .
various signals emerged from discussions with the kazakh authorities .
the level of priority accorded by kazakhstan to relations with the european union is extremely unclear .
all the participants stressed that kazakhstan 's absolute priority is to strengthen relations with russia .
however , it remains unclear whether strengthening relations with the union , with us in other words , is as important as those with china , the usa and japan .
the kazakhstan government assured the commission that , despite the agreement , kazakhstan considered itself to be free to determine for itself the content and conditions of its relations with third countries .
it remains to be seen whether this will be possible as regards trade .
customs union agreements , for example , prescribe the automatic acceptance of russia 's customs tariffs and customs legislation .
the ambassadors of the member states of the eu in alma-ata have noted that the european companies which are represented in the country are hesitant about investment .
they have adopted a ' wait and see ' attitude on account of the uncertainty surrounding kazakhstan 's political structure .
although certain companies have moved to tashkent in uzbekistan , there has not as yet been any large-scale withdrawal from alma-ata .
the commission delegation stressed the need to establish close regional cooperation among the central asian republics , both for economic reasons and with the aim of fostering stability in the region , which is ethnically extremely diverse .
the european union regards as essential regional cooperation and voluntary integration with respect for the independence and sovereignty of each participating country .
the kazakhs appear to be open to the idea of establishing communications to the west , to europe , through the caspian sea and the caucasus .
in political terms this would be an attractive way of complementing the country 's priority orientation to russia .
tacis is supporting projects such as transport corridors in the caucasus and central asia and the working party for oil and glass management .
it is too soon to draw conclusions about how and at what speed relations with the european union will develop in the future .
in view of the country 's geopolitical interests and its wealth of natural resources , the european union should follow political developments in kazakhstan closely .
the interim agreement provides the appropriate basis for the promotion of such a development .
the debate is closed .
we shall now proceed with the vote .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
cooperation agreement with nepal
madam president , as you have just mentioned , this is a question of deciding to ratify the first , and therefore historic , economic and trade cooperation agreement between the european union and nepal .
this agreement , as one may easily imagine , represents hope for this little himalayan country .
since 1990 nepal has been engaged in a radical institutional change which has led to free multi-party elections and the alternation of democratic governments .
in this connection i should like to express to the commissioner here present the hope and the request that the commission will open an office at katmandu as in other asiatic countries .
i hope the commission will take up this suggestion and i am sure that the european parliament , in approving the budget , will support this request .
i must stress that the draft agreement submitted for our approval has the same features as those already concluded by the european union with other developing countries .
i wish to point out the importance of the so-called human rights clause in the agreement , which is a positive and characteristic feature .
i should like , in fact , to remind the nepalese government that it is true that the requirement of respect for democratic principles and human rights is one of the principal characteristics of european policy towards developing countries .
it is also a fact , moreover , that the government of nepal has unequivocally committed itself to promoting and guaranteeing total respect for human rights in the country .
europe must welcome this readiness and must confirm that it will continue both to follow attentively the human rights situation in nepal and if appropriate to exert the necessary and appropriate political pressure .
from an economic and commercial point of view it is vital for the aims laid down in the agreement to be achieved as soon as possible .
it must in fact be stressed that nepal has an extremely adverse balance of trade .
its total imports amounted in 1992 to 780 million dollars , whilst export earnings were the equivalent of only 350 million dollars .
the kingdom of nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world and therefore has to face difficult challenges in the field of development .
we are dealing , as i said , with a young democracy , still fragile , seeking unconditional support in order to be able to consolidate definitively its own process of democratic transition .
the cooperation agreement concluded by the european union and nepal sets up a stable institutional framework , capable of assisting such a situation at both political level and the level of economic and social development .
i therefore recommend parliament to proceed without delay to ratify this economic and trade cooperation agreement .
madam president , i congratulate mr pettinari on the quality of his report .
respect for human rights is an important element in the draft before us .
indeed , it is actually the subject of the first article of that draft .
well , nepal is not entirely above criticism in this matter .
the police still use methods which could be described as dubious , to say the least .
we are now being invited to open the way to stable , sustainable development in nepal , accompanied by respect for human rights .
however , it should be noted that the committee on budgets has expressed several important criticisms regarding the conclusion of this agreement perhaps because of the absence of the financial statement , although one was appended to the agreement .
madam president , this is the first cooperation agreement between the european union and nepal and as such it is a landmark in our relations .
i welcome it most warmly as vice-chair of the south-asian delegation .
i deplore that it has taken four months to bring to plenary because of an internal dispute in parliament .
we must sort this sort of thing out much more quickly in future .
nepal has made great strides in developing a pluralistic , democratic system of government in the last few years .
it is to be complimented on this .
one way to tackle this is to improve education for women and alleviate rural poverty .
this agreement can help in doing this .
as katmandu is host to the secretariat of saarc .
i endorse the rapporteur 's request that the commission put a full representative in there as soon as possible .
i regret the unenthusiastic opinion from the committee on budgets which might have been avoided if the commission had put forward a more rigorous financial statement as part of the agreement .
in that context i wholeheartedly commend the agreement to the house .
madam president , the group of the european people 's party welcomes the fact that we have now , as the previous speaker mentioned , finally achieved this cooperation agreement with nepal .
i should therefore like to ask the commission to give special attention to this sector .
from that point of view we have got a good start here .
of course nepal still has a problem with child labour , but the country has made some progress .
we cannot change conditions by this demand alone , but somewhere here there has to be some kind of quid pro quo as well ; that much is obvious , of course .
several speakers have referred to the fact that the per capita income is extremely low in this country , and child labour is a sign of this , and must be considered accordingly .
the other problem , forced prostitution , is also a matter of common knowledge .
i very much support the opinion of the committee on foreign affairs , security and defence policy , including on the question of human rights .
the issue of imprisonment for debt is certainly a problem which is rooted in the country and its history .
madam president , i thank mr pettinari for this excellent report .
nepal is very high up and helping this country where needs are very great must also be high up on our list .
we must have a presence there just when the process of democratization is beginning to bear fruit .
finally it is right to place great emphasis on development cooperation and sustainable economic development is of paramount importance .
nepal is chiefly dependent for its income on tourists , but we must not let them spoil whatever remains of a good environment .
the union , madam president , is nepal 's foremost trading partner .
we must support this country , which has a geo-strategically very important but isolated position between china and india .
we shall therefore naturally vote for the cooperation agreement .
i myself have visited the country several times , and i have seen the problems for myself , at first hand , problems which also affect those areas that lie at a higher altitude .
this reafforestation programme was given a very positive reception .
i believe that the european union quite simply has a duty to help this small asiatic state .
therefore i welcome the fact that this agreement has given rise to the present debate , and i believe that in future the union will have to take further important decisions on this subject .
it is the first treaty between the european union and a third country which is based on respect for and observance of human rights .
if human rights are not respected , the treaty can be suspended .
like anita pollack , i welcome this , as the deputy vice-president of the european parliament 's saarc group .
i am delighted that we are able to debate this agreement here today , in the presence of the ambassador of the kingdom of nepal to the eu .
they have now laid the foundations , and i am delighted that we are able to build on these foundations together .
we also want to provide incentives for direct investment in nepal .
we want to encourage business links with european smes ( small and medium-sized enterprises ) , to give long-term support to economic development , and to guarantee better market access for nepalese products .
namaste !
madam president , the first bilateral agreement between the community and nepal will surely help improve relations between the community and the himalayan kingdom as regards politics , trade and cooperation .
this agreement represents a further demonstration of the importance of asia to the community in its efforts to develop foreign relations .
the summit which took place recently in bangkok was another milestone .
cooperation agreements with bangladesh , cambodia , laos and pakistan are also under discussion .
the nepal agreement comes at a time when the country is undergoing a process of democratisation , where respect for human rights continues to be a major challenge .
the political dialogue gives us the opportunity to stress the importance of human rights and democratic principles , which of course also includes the question of child labour .
it will speed up the process leading to the opening of a delegation by the european union and it will help promote regional cooperation between the countries of southern asia .
the joint parliamentary committee is responsible for dialogue on cooperation and for trade and investment issues .
it is hoped that the first meeting of the joint parliamentary committee will be held in katmandu in september or october 1996 .
my colleague , commissioner mar&iacute;n , is also planning a visit to nepal and will of course have the opportunity there to talk with the nepalese leaders .
naturally , it will only be at the meeting of the joint parliamentary committee that there will be an opportunity to delimit and define certain of the priorities which need to be established .
thank you , mrs gradin .
the debate is closed .
we shall now proceed to the vote .

support for arable crops
within the framework of the uruguay round decisions , the european union is committed , under the blair house agreement , to growing a maximum quantity of oilseeds for the non-food sector on set-aside land .
the background to this arrangement is as follows : the set-aside scheme was introduced as part of the 1992 agricultural reform in order to limit the supply of cereals and oilseeds for food .
the cultivation of certain agricultural products for use in the non-food sector is permitted on such land .
the production of methyl ester - known as ' bio-diesel ' - from oilseed rape gives rise to a by-product , rape cake , which , like soya meal , can be used in animal feedingstuffs .
these feedingstuffs now compete with certain imported feedingstuffs , most of which are imported from the united states .
the present proposal by the commission is intended to introduce measures to restrict the rape cultivation in question if this figure of 1 million tonnes of soya bean meal equivalents is exceeded .
depending on how you calculate it , this quantity is equivalent to a cultivation area of about 1.2 million hectares of rape , a figure which so far has never been reached in the european union .
this scheme has no effect on expenditure from the european budget .
however , in 1995 the amount produced was 940 tonnes , which fell well short of the maximum permitted quantity of 1 million tonnes .
this figure , which is based on the commission 's calculations , must clearly have been set too high as a result of using conversion coefficients which were no longer appropriate .
as a result of the reduction in the set-aside quota a falling trend is actually expected in 1996 .
it was precisely this that we were trying to avoid in this report , which i drafted .
i should just like to make a few brief comments on the amendments . the maximum limit of 1 million tonnes applies only to by-products intended for food or feed use .
many by-products can however be used for other purposes .
this means that our farmers have the chance of developing this alternative fuel on a larger scale , if they are able to grow an unlimited quantity of rape on their set-aside land .
the reason for this is that the change in the range of oilseed varieties in recent years has resulted in a reduction in the crude protein / fat content .
amendment no 2 takes these recent developments into account by setting lower coefficients which are legally binding .
the coefficients proposed by the edn are of course better from the mathematical point of view , but in practical terms they are not really enforceable at the present time .
nevertheless , we suggest that these coefficients should be reviewed every year and adjusted under the management committee procedure .
mr president , i would like to congratulate mr goepel on his excellent report .
he has taken a very complex , technical subject and made it comprehensible to us in the committee on agriculture and rural development .
he has put together what we believe is an excellent report . it will have our complete support .
set-aside is a very unpopular regime both with farmers and the general public .
we want to keep flexible at all stages .
that is one of the reasons why we will , in our voting , make sure that we reflect the need for flexibility .
that is one of the reasons why we will not be able to vote for the edn resolution which we believe militates against that flexibility .
i am a member from great britain , as you know .
i cannot stand up in the chamber now without saying something about the crisis in agriculture in britain at the moment .
i would like your indulgence while i very briefly tell you some of the things that are happening .
on 20 march , overnight , businesses which had thrived for many years were simply wiped out .
it is now 17 april and i deeply regret that the british government and the european commission seem to be engaged in megaphone diplomacy on the issue .
i would plead for all parties involved to get round the table as quickly as possible and bring this crisis to an end. eighty-five percent of british beef herds have never had a case of bse .
we can look our continental partners in the face and say it is safe to eat british beef .
we deeply regret this terrible slur cast on our meat industry .
i do not think the entire blame for the delay lies with the commission .
i have the uncomfortable feeling that the british government is about to embark on the general election campaign using the beef crisis as one of its main planks .
my advice to the british government is : please , do not go down that road for electoral purposes .
please , use your common sense and make sure that we try as hard as we can to bring this crisis to a resolution .
i say to the british government : please , please , please , do not play politics with people 's jobs and livelihoods .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to say , first of all , that i am very pleased with the proposed report , and that it is particularly important for austria too .
amendment no 1 in particular provides long overdue clarification in connection with the cultivation of crops such as rape , for example .
it follows from this that not only can residual waste products be made use of , but also an incentive is provided to use set-aside areas for the production of renewable raw materials .
in this field , austria has had very good experience over a long period .
in our country we have used energy plants not only for heating , but also as lubricants or as methyl ester obtained from rape , and we have really been most successful with it .
however , i believe that in future it will be important that we should work out some taxation arrangements for energy from biomass , on a europe-wide basis , because it is the only environmentally friendly form of energy .
i believe that we owe it to future generations to have a change of attitude on this subject .
a regular review of the coefficients will take into account the progress that is continually being observed in breeding new rape varieties , and their higher oil content .
this means that the limit of 1 million tonnes of soya bean meal equivalents will not be reached so quickly , and it will not , therefore , lead to restrictions on renewable raw materials .
i therefore support the report before the house , which is a vital necessity not only for austria , but also for europe .
mr president , as chance would have it the start of production of biofuels in european agriculture virtually coincided with the world environment summit which took place in rio a few years ago .
the principle of using oil seeds for non-food purposes is simple .
the regulations in force provide for the set-aside of some agricultural land .
however , the use of that land to produce oil seeds for non-food purposes is authorized .
the only problem is that not all the oil seeds can be converted to non-food purposes .
the commission is taking account of this constraint , and the amendments tabled by the committee on agriculture are mitigating its effects .
mr president , mr goepel , we support your report .
we share your view that we must have this scheme , from the point of view of both the cultivation of this crop and the conversion coefficient .
i shall therefore not go into the matter in any further detail , but will use my two minutes to give my views on set aside as a whole .
you know that the set-aside scheme was originally introduced by the commission , amongst other things as an environmental element .
we have come a long way from that , and the fact that we are now allowed to grow renewable raw materials no longer has anything to do with the ecological element .
moreover , oilseed rape , which is essentially what we are talking about here , is not an ecological crop , at least not in practice , the way it is grown at present .
the idea behind it would be the same .
here too we would have non-food production , but with a by-product in the form of animal feed .
it is precisely this problem on which the americans have intervened .
if we allow pulse crops to be grown for fodder under this scheme , then we would produce the same effect , but the ecological improvement would be greater .
by having a flexible set-aside quota , we would also be able to ask ourselves constantly how much we want to take out of the market and how much we want to release as animal feed .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the blair house agreement set the production of oil seed cake obtained from the cultivation of set-aside land in the european union at one million tonnes of soya bean meal equivalent .
these plant products are now very important to us .
let me explain : firstly , the level of european self-sufficiency in proteins intended for animal feeds is declining , on a net basis , and is no more than 29 % .
it will be highly undesirable for european farmers to be deprived of a source of plant protein which is compatible with the gatt agreements .
it proposes that the coefficients of equivalents between soya bean meal and rapeseed or sunflower seed cake should be calculated .
it is obvious that these coefficients must depend first on the specific composition of these plants , and secondly on their food value determined through their real digestibility potential .
these one-sided ceilings are expressed , for the various crops concerned , in a common accounting unit - tonnes of soya bean meal equivalents .
but , of course , in order to make the calculations it is necessary to know the conversion coefficient for each production .
in the first half of 1995 the commission presented a first draft of a scale of equivalences , based on the by-products ' contents of proteins and residual oils and fats .
it would be , as it were , a penalty unilaterally applied by us on ourselves .
today , this house is asked to consider the proposal for a council regulation intended to establish the system for monitoring the ceilings .
we see this as an opportunity for parliament to suggest the application of fairer coefficients .
that is the purpose of our amendment no 5 , which is additional to mr goepel 's excellent report and bases the conversion coefficients on much more relevant criteria than those proposed hitherto , criteria which are scientifically justified .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to start by saying how impressed we are by mr goepel 's excellent report in this matter .
even so , i should note that the limitation to one million tonnes of oil seed byproducts , decided upon at blair house in 1992 , is clearly contrary to the interests of the european community .
in fact , imports are certain to increase , contrary to what the commission claims .
even in 1995 there was a shortage and it would have been possible to export , since world prices were higher than on the european market .
at that time , however , the commission had imposed taxes on cereal exports .
first , mr president , my compliments to mr goepel for the careful way in which he has drafted his report .
as has already appeared from the discussions in the committee on agriculture , we can support his amendments .
i am particularly curious to know the commission 's reaction to one of the amendments : what is the commission 's view on the use of the by-products for purposes other than for food or feed ?
what is the commission 's view on the use of these by-products for energy production ?
another aspect in this connection is that the use of biodiesel everywhere in europe has assumed enormous proportions .
that might be because a large part of the areas set aside is being used for the cultivation of oleaginous plants .
it may also be because indirectly a subsidy is being given .
if my information is correct , there has long been a commission proposal before the council aimed at encouraging the use of these biodiesels by reducing the tax on them .
i should like to hear from the commission what the situation is with regard to that proposal .
the commission wants to encourage the use of these products .
probably the production of oleaginous plants for biodiesel will be reduced as the amount of land set aside is reduced .
what alternative method can the commission propose in the future so that the heartening use of these raw materials is not lost ?
those are two specific questions .
mr president , mr goepel and the committee on agriculture and rural development have together produced a constructive report , on which i congratulate them .
it is byproducts from the cultivation of certain oilseeds on land which has been set aside which are concerned .
if such byproducts exceed 1 million tonnes per year , expressed in soya meal equivalents , measures have to be taken .
amendment no 1 proposes that the threshold of 1 million tonnes should apply only to byproducts used in foodstuffs and animal feed .
other areas of use , including energy production or the provision of humus should be excepted .
the commission accepts this amendment .
amendments nos 2 , 4 and 5 are aimed at ensuring that the council regulation takes into account the coefficients which have to be used in converting rape meal and sunflower seeds into soya meal equivalents .
as this is obviously a technical question , i believe it would be more appropriate to leave it to the management committee .
amendment no 3 proposes that sanctions should be imposed the year after the threshold has been exceeded .
in accordance with the commission 's proposal sanctions should be applied in the same year .
this makes it clearer that regard is being paid to the memorandum of understanding .
it will also prevent significant fluctuations in the supply of the byproducts concerned from year to year .
the commission thus cannot approve the amendment .
thank you , mrs gradin .
the debate is closed .
we shall now proceed to the vote .

g7 meeting on employment
the next item is the statement by the commission on the results of the g7 meeting on employment of 1-2 april in lille .
the group came to a number of very important conclusions which the commission was particularly pleased to note .
the summit agreed that this would not be easy because far-reaching reforms would be required but that they would be all the more effective if they enjoyed widespread support and if workers and employers were actively involved .
the second major point they made was that in order to attain our objective , we need to ensure strong economic growth and structural reform , which requires a well-balanced mix of macroeconomic and employment policies .
but they did not stop there , they went on to say that each worker should have access to vocational training and upward mobility in order to adapt to economic and technological changes .
thirdly , they made a strong declaration about the need to prevent and fight social exclusion .
the problem of those workers who find it difficult to adapt to the labour market cannot - and will not - be resolved in conditions of continuing or increasing insecurity in their pay and living conditions .
finally , i would like to stress that the meeting of the g7 members was characterized by an openness to change , not erecting barriers but rather encouraging opportunities to compete in the global economy .
they all acknowledged the need to pursue vigorously open trading policies and called on trade ministers to maintain the momentum of trade liberalization through the world trade organization and at its conference in singapore .
at the same time the g7 noted the importance of unchanging core labour standards around the world , thereby acknowledging the concerns of the trade unions and of many governments .
in the context they referred to the completion of the studies by the oecd and the ilo and the social dimensions of international trade .
mr president , the socialist group supports every real - and i stress , real - initiative to deal with the problem of unemployment .
to the extent that the french presidency 's initiative for lille can be considered real , it certainly has our support .
where unemployment is concerned , the time for seminars is past .
it is true that among g7 some economies achieve lower unemployment levels than others .
on the contrary .
those are fine words , but what is to happen in practice ?
we expect something more from the meeting of the g7 leaders .
we need measures , not just discussions .
the lille conference was long on discussions but short on measures .
at any rate , it is positive that its analyses point in the right direction .
the g7 leaders disassociated their position from the theory that development can continue within a framework of unemployment .
the statement stresses that more rapid development is a basic prerequisite for fighting unemployment .
we agree .
development at a rate higher than at present is certainly a prerequisite for the absorption of any significant proportion of unemployment .
the position stated in the white paper is correct , and the commissioner very rightly comments that the g7 conclusions confirm the european union 's strategy .
the problem is that it is not enough for political leaders to meet and congratulate one another .
g7 could indeed contribute to more rapid development , because more rapid development depends on increased investment .
besides , so far as europe is concerned , we have said that the investment level ought to increase from 18 % to 25 % .
the white paper says so too .
an international coordination of macroeconomic policy - which the governments do not want just now and which is probably also not possible on that scale - could increase investment levels .
no such coordination is possible .
measures could , however , be adopted to restrict the profiteering use of capital and to encourage its use for real investment .
taxation measures , measures to combat monetary instability , measures of a nature that can only be taken at world-wide level , so that they cannot be used by one group of countries against another .
in a rapidly developing economy the markets will become more elastic , working people will have better training opportunities , and all this will in turn further the speeding up of the economy .
but we cannot start with those things .
we must start with a systematic financial and monetary effort to increase the rate of development .
everything else must come later and contribute to that .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to draw the following conclusions from the meeting of the g7 countries in lille .
there are 18.3 million registered unemployed in the european union , and they are a risk to social peace .
the battle against unemployment is not a purely national problem .
on the contrary , now that national economies have become integrated , it must be fought on a europe-wide or even a worldwide basis .
it is caused by the following factors : the rise in labour costs , and particularly in costs accessory to wages , the falling off of investments , and the imbalance between job supply and demand .
nowadays , economic growth alone is not sufficient to reduce unemployment .
the natural level of unemployment , and with it the numbers of long-term unemployed , increases with every recession .
poverty and debt in developing countries affect exports .
the crucial factor in determining international competitiveness is now the innovative capacity of the economy .
this is threatened by a certain amount of hostility towards technology in some parts of europe , particularly on the part of the greens .
we need a high level of education for our employees , a highperformance infrastructure and good framework conditions to encourage innovation .
secondly , they must create a favourable climate for saving and investment activity and for business creation , by means of tax-law provisions .
thirdly , they must increase financial resources and provide guidance in technological research .
fourthly , they must encourage industrial production in fields involving state-of-the-art technology , by setting standards and providing guidance for public procurement .
fifthly , there must be better coordination between industrial-policy measures and trade-policy dealings with third countries .
sixthly , when regulations and joint-action programmes are decided on , particular attention should be given to small and medium-sized enterprises , in order to take into account their special characteristics .
seventhly , a transport policy should be implemented which aims to develop transport facilities as a necessary instrument for expanding trade with third countries .
another important prerequisite is to do away with bureaucracy .
mr president , i should also like to lay claim to the extra minute that was allowed to the speaker on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists .
i welcome the initiative of the french president in urging the g7 states to adopt a common employment policy at last , and i regret the fact that his efforts were entirely unsuccessful .
i regard this meeting as a first step and i think that the g7 should draw a number of conclusions from it .
my idea is that if it does not come from the union it will not get on to the agenda in the right way .
mr president , i find it difficult to understand the source of the optimism and satisfaction displayed by the commission and by g7 itself , concerning the fight against unemployment .
it is becoming more and more clear that the development noted , and even the development it is hoped to achieve , is incapable of leading to increased employment .
i would like to put a number of questions to the commissioner :
to what extent is it estimated that the competitiveness of european companies can be increased by reducing the so-termed non-labour costs , in other words employment contributions towards social welfare ?
against which countries is this competitiveness to be increased ?
the united states ? the new industrialized countries of the far east ?
which countries ?
to what extent can such support contribute substantially towards increasing employment and cutting unemployment ?
mr president , i must say that words fail me - and that is something that does not , i think , happen to me very often .
the first priority that is emphasized everywhere , the scandal of mass unemployment , is being treated here like a sort of appendix to the session .
i must say that that takes a lot of swallowing !
mrs gradin , why are the commission and the community not taking action to ensure that the subject is discussed at the united nations economic and social council ?
will the commission finally decide where it stands in this debate ?
what sort of model for a european , active , independent policy to conquer mass unemployment do we actually want to put into practice ?
in this situation we can no longer go on pretending .
what will become of the santer pact then ?
will it continue to be followed up , after certain member states have already made it clear that they are not going to have anything to do with it ?
can an employment policy be implemented without funding ?
the finance ministers did not even go to lille !
can an employment policy be implemented without a reform - with ecological solidarity - of the tax system ?
these are questions which the commission needs to answer as a matter or urgency , and on which we must finally put an end to hypocrisy !
mr president , my impression is that the latest g7 meeting took place in the same atmosphere of indifference as our debate here this morning .
and yet nearly 20 million europeans out of work , and an unemployment rate of about 20 % among young people , might have prompted the western powers to display a little more determination and imagination .
instead , once again , the worn-out credo of ultra-liberalism seems to have dominated the proceedings .
the americans have denounced social entitlements as an unemployment factor , conveniently forgetting that , in their own country , another 40 million people are living in poverty and exclusion .
madam commissioner , you know how much importance we in this house attach to the social integration of europe , a europe which cares for the well-being of its citizens and guarantees them a minimum standard of social welfare .
only on wednesday , in the course of the debate on the turin conference , we restated that necessity .
in a nutshell , how are we to reconcile technological innovation , employment and accepted social benefits ?
in the eyes of the growing number of europeans , the aim of the policy pursued by brussels seems to be to break down national peculiarities in order to clear the road for this globalization and facilitate its progress .
instead of protecting us , therefore , the policy of brussels would become the implicit ally of those opposed to our societies , our ways of life and our nations .
the answer most frequently given to this serious accusation is that the best way in which the european states can defend themselves is to improve their competitiveness .
unfortunately , however , that is only partly true .
does the commission think that the cost of european labour will be able to compete with the cost of labour in the emerging countries ?
does it think that , by disrupting national societies , it will promote a competitiveness of the european region ?
and if not , how does it expect to reestablish a community preference which is capable not of preventing globalization but of disciplining it ?
mr president , commissioner , i am also speaking for mr schreiner .
the statements that have been made today admittedly make clear the commission 's firm intention to make employment a central theme of its work .
practical measures are lacking , however , and platitudes remain ineffectual .
the same applies to savings programmes without simultaneous structural reform .
by this i mean the exorbitantly high costs associated with wages in europe , the excessive taxation systems , the overregulation and the - to a greater or lesser extent - uncontrollable bureaucracy in individual member states .
we shall not create jobs by adopting regulations and declarations of intent .
jobs will only be created by competitive framework conditions and , as a result , optimistic investors who are willing to take a risk , and not by the whingeing of affluent citizens .
mr president , i just wanted to re-ask the question : how can we breathe new life into the world economy and , more particularly , into the eu economy ?
we all speak a lot about unemployment and about job creation .
the reality , unfortunately , in my view , is very different .
this environment is making it much more difficult to increase employment levels .
i ask the commission : how can we cope with this ?
surely we cannot turn the clock backwards .
society must continue to move forward and progress .
every citizen in europe wants to see this happening .
every effort has to be made to achieve development but , unfortunately , this approach is being resisted .
it is being resisted by environmentalists .
i do not want to suggest that we should not consider environmental issues - of course we should .
but everybody seems to want to resist and oppose development and efforts to get things done .
so i want to ask the commission : is there a way , can you reconcile these differences ?
is the commission looking at this side of the argument at all .
i say this with respect , commissioner gradin , but it always seems to me that it is pious platitudes but no action .
can you answer my questions , please ?
mr president , thank you for all the interesting contributions and comments on my report from the g7 meeting .
unemployment is the most serious issue facing the european union .
for many , it is a tragedy that there are 18 million people outside the labour market .
everyone , i think , knows someone in their own circles who does not have a job .
it is especially tragic when unemployment affects young people .
this is why unemployment is at the top of the commission 's working programme agenda .
the same was true at the european council meeting in turin , where it was felt that unemployment and employment should be one of the central issues at the intergovernmental conference .
it is also against this background that the commission has put forward its proposal for a stabilisation pact , and it is for that reason that president santer is currently travelling around the fifteen capital cities .
in this way we wish to defend the social model which we consider to be so important in our european union .
briefly , mr president , i believe that the commission has here shown how serious it is by presenting concrete proposals .
we thus look forward now to a response from all fifteen governments and to president santer receiving that response on his current visits .
thank you , commissioner .
adjournment of the session
ladies and gentlemen , once again , let me thank you for taking part in a friday morning sitting , so that parliament 's business can move forward .
today , however , my thanks are especially significant . i have learned a great deal from mr martens ' impeccable conduct as a parliamentarian .
today , he has taught me something new : that it is possible to celebrate your birthday and still fulfil your duties in this chamber .
thank you , mr martens .
i declare adjourned the session of the european parliament .
( the sitting was closed at 11.45 a.m. )
resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday , 19 april 1996 .
tribute
ladies and gentlemen , it is my sad duty to inform you of the death of mr robert hersant on 21 april 1996 .
mr hersant was chairman of the robert hersant press group .
from 1956 to 1978 he was a member of the french national assembly .
in the direct elections of 1984 , 1989 and 1994 mr hersant was elected to the european parliament and was a member of the group of the european people 's party in this house .
he was a member of the committee on social affairs and employment .
our sympathy goes to his family , his parliamentary group and all his friends .
i now ask you to rise for one minute to honour his memory .
( parliament rose and observed one minute 's silence )
mr president , i wish to raise a point of order under rule 102 ( 2 ) .
as an english speaker , i condemn this discourtesy to other members of parliament .
it is very discriminatory that they should be forced to present their views in a foreign language .
the committee views this with the greatest concern .
all speakers in this parliament are entitled to speak in their mother tongue whether that language is spoken by many or by few .
mr president , i want to say something about the celebration of an important day tomorrow , i.e. schuman day , europe day or peace in europe day .
this parliament should know about this and if you ask why is he doing this , it is because of the beef crisis .
he is trying to make europe the scapegoat for his own inadequacies in representing the scottish beef industry .
however , i am glad to tell the house that local authorities right across scotland will be flying the flag in defiance of that ban .
i shall look into that , mr florio .
the next item is the statement by the commission on urgent political matters of major importance .
i call mr fischler , member of the commission .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to thank you very much for the opportunity to report on the latest steps in the effort to end this bse crisis that affects all of us .
i wish to confine my report to the developments that have taken place since my previous report to the house .
let me highlight especially the conclusions adopted by the council of agricultural ministers on 29 and 30 april .
ladies and gentlemen , it gives me great pleasure to welcome to the gallery today the speaker of the polish senate , mr adam struzik , and his parliamentary colleagues .
mr president , thank you very much for looking in this direction .
commissioner , you have spoken again about solidarity , and i agree with you . however , the demands you made of the british government in your appeal for solidarity have not yet been met .
are you aware of any herds with a history of bse having actually been slaughtered ?
are you able to check on how the additional programme that was announced is working , or do you know how it is supposed to work and whether it has been set in motion at all ?
it is not true that nothing has been done in england . on the contrary , appropriate efforts have been made there , although the report does say that these efforts have not always been sufficient .
so this means that the measures have to be further intensified .
first of all , commissioner , do some investigation and tell us the names of those british companies which manufactured these feeds in the 1980s .
well then , get your staff to compile it .
i would like to thank commissioner fischler for coming here once again and giving us an up-to-date statement .
i also welcome the fact that he is going to present a financial package at a future meeting . however , i was a little concerned to hear him say it was going to be confined to farmers .
as he rightly pointed out , the whole agricultural industry within the united kingdom is affected financially by the crisis that has been brought on by the british government 's inaction in this area .
it will also be necessary in the medium term to examine the question of promotion activities for beef , but we in the commission firmly believe that such activities would be rather pointless at the present moment .
you must bear in mind that intervention alone will use up a large percentage of the resources .
the cost of buying 100 000 tonnes of beef into intervention has to be estimated at around ecu 200 million .
in the month of april alone we have taken 50 000 tonnes of beef off the market .
this proposal will be tabled at the next meeting of the standing veterinary committee , which we have scheduled for 15 may . the next step will depend on the decision reached by the standing veterinary committee .
if the council does not reach a decision , jurisdiction will be transferred back to the commission . if a simple majority of the council rejects the proposal , however , that decision is final .
there was only a telephone call half an hour before the announcement in the house of commons , informing me that it would be made .
that is a far more fundamental aspect . this additional slaughter programme is also about reducing the chances of future bse outbreaks .
mr president , i usually find the commissioner 's replies very satisfactory , as i do in this case too .
but what we can say is that we are ready to assume what amounts to 70 % of the value of the 700 000 or so cattle over 30 months old that are slaughtered every year .
i welcome the commissioner 's statement about the progressive lifting of the ban . we were promised that in luxembourg and now we are having this for tallow .
i should like to ask him about two things he mentioned . one was about the inspection group : how long did it visit scotland in particular , and also northern ireland and england .
nobody seemed to know about it in scotland .
secondly , it is also true that northern ireland has a more up-to-date identification system for cattle .
my first question is : how soon can we expect a compensation package to be put in place ?
secondly , in relation to the disposal of offal from the meat industry which is now emerging as a very serious problem ; does he think that research is needed into the commercial disposal of offal ?
this also means that i shall be submitting proposals for that purpose to the commission next wednesday .
mr herman , one component of the decision that was taken is that the unilateral measures adopted at national level should be revoked without delay .
but i note your failure to reply to the question put by my neighbour , mr collins .
what arrangements have been made for a coordinated study , or at least a pooling of information , on exactly what constitutes creutzfeldt-jakob disease on the one hand and mad cow disease on the other ?
are there any possibilities of information exchange and joint research in the european union ?
most of the comment i have heard on this matter has come from the agriculture ministers , not the health ministers .
i agree with you when you advise great caution .
but i would ask you to remember that i did not say there was no vertical transmission but rather that our reflections to date had been based on that assumption .
that in itself , however , does not automatically constitute proof that the disease was contracted in one of these ways . we must keep that in mind .
that is also the reason why i have asked the leading researchers who are working on these questions in various parts of the world to assist us in dealing with these very complex issues .
professor weissmann , along with his colleagues who are working on this throughout the world , has expressed willingness to devise a strategy for defining the necessary research priorities .
so i ask you whether precautionary measures should not be taken to prevent embryonic transmission , especially since young animals are also used for the manufacture of medicinal products .
a dialysate made from calves ' blood is used throughout europe . it is reputedly very safe .
mr president , commissioner , i should like to ask two questions . the commissioner is putting a lot of emphasis on slaughter .
slaughtering is a kind of target-practice : nobody knows for sure whether the animals being slaughtered are suffering from the disease or not .
but the main question has to do with what we are eating .
beef has been banned in all countries . what effective controls are being carried out and what measures have been taken to control every farm , in that any farmer could use feed meal ?
the question of feeding animal , meat and bone meals is clearly regulated . i have explained the system that already exists in britain .
but there is a ban that applies throughout the eu on the feeding of meat and bone meals to ruminants . that is regulated for the whole union , which means that you actually have no cause for concern .
your second question concerns cattle that can be guaranteed never to have been fed with such dubious products .
i have three questions .
is this any worse in britain than in any other member state ? are european rules not being adequately implemented ?
some clarification would be welcome .
secondly rumours abound in my country that there is bse on the continent but not necessarily from the export of british animals .
can you categorically confirm there is no bse in other member states , other than from the export of british animals ?
these cases therefore need to be examined with particular care .
mr vallv&eacute; , you are well aware of the rules governing question time . your question was not relevant to the present subject .
i shall leave it to the commissioner whether he wishes to answer it , but he need not answer it . the rule is that we keep to the agreed topic !
mr president , commissioner , i believe that while we discuss bse here consumers are reacting by turning away from beef in increasing numbers .
you have referred to the identification of meat , in other words to the label of origin .
i am still not quite clear why there should be any great difference between that and the labelling of fruit and vegetables .
if you cast your eye over the tables in our canteen here at lunchtime , you will see that hardly any meat is being eaten , and i believe that this reflects consumer behaviour in general .
the nutritional consultant for top german athletes always says that it is far more difficult to achieve a balanced diet without meat than with meat .
i am a bit concerned that this issue is now becoming seriously divisive .
what is being done to establish firmly the principle of indicating the origin of meat throughout the eu ?
mrs keppelhoff-wiechert , why is labelling considerably more difficult for meat than it is for fruit and vegetables ? there are two aspects , which i believe are important , to be considered .
the second aspect that has to be considered is the fact that there are two separate issues here that are repeatedly confused .
do we want a simple indication of origin , or a genuine labelling system , with a special stamp denoting the origin of the meat ?
first i should like to thank the president for coming to wales to discuss this issue and the concerns of the people of wales affected by the bse crisis .
i would also thank the commissioner for coming to discuss the issue with us again today .
with regard to cattle feed , in connection with the revised ban on the feeding of meat and bone meal we also introduced appropriate labelling provisions .
from now on , it must be stated on every sack of feed whether or not the feed may be given to ruminants , and that applies throughout the union .
commissioner , the problems of bse confront us with a situation where , as i see it , it is better to run the risk of preaching excessive caution than the risk of giving unwarranted assurances .
from a medical point of view , as well as from the perspective of farmers outside the united kingdom , i consider it important to clarify one point again here .
my second question takes up the point made by mr b&ouml;ge .
let me come back first of all to the question of safety with regard to gelatine .
the safety of gelatine depends on two factors . the first is the question of the tissues selected for the manufacture of gelatine at the outset .
these are all low-risk tissue types , constituent parts of hide and the like in which there are scarcely any prions to be found , even in infected animals .
the second factor is the way in which gelatine is manufactured , the process .
this process , of course , comprises several stages - heat treatment , simultaneous pressurizing and also acid curing .
so if a certain standard is maintained at each of these stages of the manufacturing process , there can be no doubt that the gelatine is safe .
that reflects the recommendations of the world health organization and the more detailed interpretation of the recommendations by the standing veterinary committee .
i also wish to thank the commissioner for the fullness and openness of his reporting to parliament .
secondly , in the measures to assist beef producers who have lost money , will he be proposing that all beef producers who have suffered serious loss will be compensated .
in particular i refer to the tradition in the common agricultural policy of applying premiums to male animals only .
are people who specialize in producing female animals rather than male animals going to be left out once again ?
mr mccartin , let us look first of all at these additional promotion measures . as i have said , we shall be tabling proposals and ideas here .
it is too soon to deliver a definitive opinion on the matter today .
but our proposals will be submitted within this framework , and at that point it will surely be necessary to talk about this year 's price package in connection with the present discussion .
with the approval of parliament , the commission has already proposed the consolidation of the premium for male cattle into one single premium and the abandonment of the present double payment of premiums .
that is another question that will have to be discussed in this context .
we all recognize that bse had its roots in the feeding of ruminants with high protein meal and also bonemeal .
i do not want to add to the scare but bonemeal is extensively used in the horticultural industry . therefore i would ask what action has been taken or might be taken to advise the horticultural industry ?
can we now set a date for that inquiry ?
ladies and gentlemen , that brings us to the end of question time . our thanks go to commissioner fischler for making himself available for almost one and a half hours to answer our questions here .
the next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions :
mr president , the news from burundi in the last few days is simply bewildering . there is talk of an average of 1000 deaths a month .
today or tomorrow it may come to genocide . a coup is almost certain .
what is happening in burundi is terrible , all the more so as democratic elections have been held there . unfortunately the first democratic president was murdered on 21 october 1993 .
nevertheless he had put together a government whose composition was not ethnically one-sided . since then the tension between the army and the civil authority has escalated to an intolerable level .
we think it is very urgent to draw attention to the climate of civil war which may lead to genocide .
we know that the member states of the european union are far from unanimous , and are sometimes even antagonistic to a european policy with regard to countries such as burundi .
what attempt is being made to silence the radio stations which are preaching hate and murder ?
or are we merely distributing humanitarian aid without going further into the problem ? what are we doing in the way of preventive diplomacy ?
or are we letting that degenerate into a ridiculous slogan ? what are we doing about it ?
who gives him his brief and to whom will he deliver his report ? our representative also said that he had made an appeal for cooperation to the organization for african unity .
negotiations yes , but with whom and how ? we must see that they include democracy .
mr president , the serious situation of political and military instability still prevailing in burundi is raising serious concern in my group , the group of the united european left .
it has become absurd that after many months ' discussion all we have done has been to send five observers to monitor respect for human rights . we must recognize that , viewed objectively , it is not much !
the conference of donors envisaged by the carcassonne plan has not yet been organized and nothing has been done as regards seeking an overall solution to the conflict in burundi .
the situation is strongly reminiscent of that which recently occurred in rwanda so commissioner pinheiro was quite right when he said recently that the country was facing a genuine hidden genocide .
in that respect many chances have been gambled away in burundi .
on that last point , i think the european union has only one possibility at the moment after all that has gone wrong .
as far as that is concerned i think there is a real duty to support nyerere at both levels .
where on earth is political awareness in the committee on budgets ? that , ladies and gentlemen , is what i call a real scandal !
to that end it adopted on 24 march 1995 a common position on burundi and between february 1995 and february 1996 four missions have gone there . the european union has repeatedly condemned the violence and has urged moderation .
the troika has requested the government of burundi to do its utmost to that end .
however , this promising situation , which showed signs of encouragement has since 15 march of this year begun to deteriorate significantly .
this attack was directed in particular against tutsi officials and their families .
it is against this background that we must decide what political action to take in the future .
from my point of view , we must be very clear : there must be a division of tasks between the various people and bodies taking part .
finally , in respect of economic aid given by the european union , this is continuing and will continue and can be substantially reinforced once the conditions are in place for it to be executed .
so if we do nothing , what is likely to happen - although i hope it will not - is the same thing all over again . there will be more massacres , and not just minor ones .
there is , of course , the very , very important intervention of president julius nyerere . there are the efforts to facilitate dialogue within the country .
there are the efforts to choke off the hate campaigns of the media , to support those independent media that talk about something other than murder . there is the aid to the ngos .
we cannot entrust all our refugees , the police and the army to zaire , and wait for it to happen . we must , then , be more vigilant .
i do not fully understand mr pettinari when he says that we should exercise such restraint towards zaire .
if it is true that zaire is involved in the conflict and if it is involved in the escalation , then i believe it ought also to take its share of responsibility for helping to end the conflict .
returning to what i said at the beginning , that country is also unlikely to be particularly sensitive to appeals from abroad .
but if it bears responsibility , it should also be included in the contacts and talks that are needed in the region .
mr president , we are helpless spectators of the hellish spiral of violence in burundi . everyone has said so .
the word ' genocide ' is not one to be used lightly , yet what other term can we use to describe the thousands of deaths that have occurred since the crisis began ?
not a day goes by without violence , torture and crime , inflicted on women and children as well as men .
to date , the member states of the union have proved incapable of reaching a consensus on the establishment of a joint policy towards burundi .
the member states represented on the security council must talk the same language , in new york and in brussels . yet it has to be said that their lines of action are totally divergent .
contradictions like this are calculated to undermine completely the process of normalization in burundi .
a joint policy has to be consistent if it is to be credible , and therefore effective .
mr boutros ghali 's proposal that an armed preventive force should be deployed on the frontiers of burundi , on permanent standby , was an excellent one .
i must emphasize the humanitarian aid provided by the european commission .
what is the commission 's role in the ajello mission , and in the coordination of the nyerere mission ?
we must bring pressure to bear on zaire to stop it being the turntable for the arms traffic in that region .
the european union must bring all its strength to bear to force zaire to shut down those radio stations that incite people to hatred .
in this context , incidentally , the commission 's move to set up a conciliatory radio station is a good idea .
the need now is to ensure that it can transmit twenty-four hours a day .
why has the council still not operationally implemented the measures outlined in the carcassonne plan for finding a solution to the burundi crisis ?
along the same lines , mr nyerere 's initiative to bring both the controlling forces and the extremist groups to the same negotiating table deserves our full support .
mr president , for several months we believed that things were calming down .
in november , december and january there were actually grounds for hoping that a degree of internal peace might return to burundi .
there is a political breakdown , too , among the political parties and leading political figures who , themselves , are at present almost universally discredited .
so what we have at this moment is a country on the brink of chaos .
fortunately , there are countries in that region that can offer some help .
then there is uganda , which goes to the polls tomorrow , and it is also true that the presence of president museveni is probably a relatively stabilizing factor .
so what proposals do we hear today ? the establishment of an armed force : all right , provided it is carefully recruited , properly armed , well trained and , above all , well led .
all right , but on condition that the initial contacts should be secret - very secret - because the risk at present is that the moderate elements in each faction may move to join the extremists .
mr president , at this stage of the debate virtually everything has already been said .
the provinces most affected are gitega - the most important province in the country - rutana , civitoque and macamba .
in the capital , bujumbura , ethnic cleansing is under way and leading members of the hutu population are being wiped out by attacks for which both armed bands and the army are responsible .
pressure must be applied from our side on the burundi government , pressure which is perfectly legitimate , since its purpose is to induce the government to try and make the burundi legal system work better .
if the situation is not to be further destabilized , those responsible for acts of terrorism must be brought to justice without delay .
to this end , the european union must not oppose the granting of aid targeted specifically at the establishment of an effective legal system .
mr president , in 1994 / 1995 the international community was paralysed by the events in rwanda and in bosnia .
over one million people died as a result of that inaction . now we continue to pick up the pieces and we measure the cost of that inaction in lives lost and in humanitarian aid .
in burundi , ethnic polarization is increasingly taking place and the tutsi minority are clearly taking power and influence in the judiciary , in the police and in the government .
as always , it is the innocent civilians who are the victims of these actions and of the increasing tension in burundi : mostly women , elderly people and children .
the estimate now is that up to a thousand people die every month in burundi .
mr president , i thank all those who have spoken for the very interesting information they have given the presidency . i shall reply in detail to a number of points which have emerged in the debate .
i would tell mr pettinari that for ourselves we fully support nyerere 's efforts and agree that all the interested parties should confer and cooperate with the former president .
i have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 40 ( 5 ) of the rules of procedure .
mr president , i should first like to pay tribute to the commissioner and his staff for the great cooperation we have had from them .
also , i should like to pay tribute across the floor to the cooperation i have received from mr wolf who was the draftsman of the opinion of the committee on social affairs and employment .
it is acceptable .
i should like to concentrate on one or two items which are in the resolution .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the comments about the good general understanding between mr cassidy and myself were certainly not unfounded .
i believe there is a point here that we really must take very seriously .
i do not mean that we are about to make history , but i do think that history is about to catch up with us .
these issues certainly merit closer examination .
admittedly , the present rate of economic growth is disappointing . however , the underlying trend is still upward , and the indications of recovery in the second half-year are real enough .
according to the data presently available , the increase in gdp in 1995 is unlikely to exceed 2.5 % , whereas we initially hoped for 3 % . in 1996 , too , activity seems lower than expected .
on 28 february i suggested to you that growth would probably be below 2 % in 1996 . in the light of our current forecast , it will be well below that figure .
the rate of inflation is also exceptionally low : 3.1 % in 1995 . finally , we should also note the stability of european exchange rates within the european monetary system .
furthermore , this return of confidence is based on very firm political commitments .
first , 1996 is notable for the determination of several member states , including france and germany , to reduce their public deficits .
mr president , this european parliament has given proof of its maturity in today 's cassidy report , which my group is happy to support , by tabling a proposal that looks to the future .
over 90 % of the goods and services produced in the eu are in demand within the eu and are sold there ; a purely export-based concept of growth is outdated and is no longer tenable .
the negative trends of past decades have taught us how important it is not to stifle and neglect domestic demand .
macroeconomic aberrations and mistakes in economic policy , as well as an overrestrictive monetary policy , have resulted in successive downturns in economic performance and hence falling levels of employment .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the commission 's annual economic report for 1996 clearly shows that the european union is in a difficult economic situation .
special efforts are therefore required .
high public deficits , and the higher interest rates needed to sustain them , prejudice economic and monetary union and thereby endanger jobs . i believe that is something mr wolf should include in his reflections .
this analysis is sound in principle , and naturally receives our support .
the translation , in budgetary terms , without trying to anticipate the procedure in course for 1997 , gives the impression of a high degree of consistency between parliament 's economic report and the draft budget for next year .
i would like commissioner de silguy , who is with us today , to know that in economic and budgetary matters the commission has the keen support of our group .
however , all those factors , which ought to have provided the basis for a process of strong economic growth - as the commission had envisaged until a few months ago - have not brought the expected result .
mr president , the commission 's economic report coincides with the beginning of the process of reviewing the maastricht treaty .
it seems that it is a faithful , a most faithful child of that parent .
the proof is , first , that it confirms adherence to the convergence criteria every member state must satisfy .
all this , on the pretext of competition between the major monopolistic enterprises so that by cutting labour costs they can increase their already excessive profits .
mr president , it is an excellent thing that this year 's report contains less wishful thinking than last year ' s .
i also believe , as regards mr von wogau 's criticism of mr wolf just now , that what mr wolf meant was of course that whole sectors of the economy are excluded from taxation .
the question is how productivity growth can be distributed fairly , so that the welfare state can be saved and the tax base secured for the future .
i should like to draw attention to the ideas which the commission has recently put forward concerning taxation . i believe they are very promising .
now it should be possible to decide on taxation jointly , but as we all know , our problem is that all the member states have to be in complete agreement before anything at all can be done .
the result is that nothing is done .
indeed , rather the contrary seems to be happening . one of these days , the commission should ask itself why .
admittedly , it does contain a prominent table which seems to suggest that the return on investment in the community today is roughly what it was during the 1960 ' s .
the reality is very different .
in any case , the commission itself fuels our misgivings when it notes , over the page , that ' the overall trend of investment is down ' .
investment problems , as a whole , then , were worthy of a less soothing , more consistent and deeper analysis .
clearly , this poor state of health of european investment would not be improved by taxation on capital , especially through the device of possible harmonization .
yet this is a proposal which is popular in certain circles , on the pretext that spontaneous development has now brought about a situation in which labour is excessively taxed .
to the contrary , what is needed now - absolutely needed - is a reduction in the taxation of labour .
nor will the ill health of european investment be improved , whatever people may say , by major projects partially financed by community loans .
the fact is that these loans , which will have to be repaid tomorrow by levies on the member states , will have to be added to the indebtedness of the states receiving them .
the keys to effective action lie elsewhere .
first , we need to improve the flexibility of the internal market along the lines rightly laid down by the essen summit , with which we are in broad agreement .
these two types of action , internal and external , are perfectly complementary and even mutually essential .
without internal flexibility , community preference would serve only to protect established rights .
but without community preference internal flexibility will still be insufficient and will merely enforce additional sacrifices without any conclusive results .
since we are talking about a gnosis , a dogma , commentaries are of course appropriate . and we find that the central problem is unemployment , which is a major breakthrough .
all this , of course , is clearly perceived by our rapporteurs . they even outline analyses of the causes , without going into too much detail .
stupidity ! they tell us that privatization is a way of filling in the hole in public financing , yet it is privatization that is digging the hole : 6 , 800 privatizations worldwide since 1980 .
mr cassidy , british steel was privatized and three-quarters of the jobs were lost ; british airways , on privatization , saw its workforce cut from 56 , 000 to 19 , 000 . and who compensates the unemployed ?
with taxes , which absorb all the income from privatization . instead of having a higher income , what we get is a deeper hole .
the stupidity , the idiocy of the convergence criteria , mr de silguy !
the french government , trying to comply with article 104c and the 3 % public deficit , increases taxes .
taxes go up , consumption falls , sales fall , profits fall , the taxable base falls , income falls and the deficits get bigger .
is it all really evidence of stupidity ? to those who know mr cassidy and mr de silguy , obviously not .
so there must be something else , and to find the answer we need to take a look at the beneficiaries of these policies . who will benefit from the privatization of french telecom , of belgacom ?
mr cassidy , in paragraph 33 you tell us that we need to reduce the fiscal burden on labour .
that 's all very well , but how is it to be done ?
it could be paid for , for example , by a tax on co2 , which will increase the costs of energy , something that is paid for by private individuals .
you did not say ' the fight against unemployment ' , you said ' unemployment : the european union 's priority ' .
mr cassidy , commissioner , you have taken us back to the nineteenth century .
you have taken us back to the days before the welfare state .
it 's a fantastic trick .
from that standpoint , you have all my admiration .
you have fully achieved the task you were given of robbing the poor to give to the rich .
mr president , i was interested to hear the point commissioner de silguy made about the similarities between mr cassidy 's report and the commission 's annual report .
if that is the case then commissioner de silguy has been looking at rather different documents to those that this house has looked at .
the one significant thing about the commission 's annual economic report is its breathtaking complacency .
the commissioner comes before us today and says that we can expect a growth rate of markedly less than 2 % within the european union this year .
when president santer took over the commission he said the key feature of this commission would be that it would do less better .
the only thing this commission has done so far on economic policy is less . we are still waiting for the better to be delivered .
there is no paradox here and the commissioner knows this . many economic experts are telling the commissioner that there is no paradox in europe 's economy .
i seriously suggest to the commission that it looks very carefully at the recommendations in the cassidy report because when that report is voted tomorrow in this house it will win a substantial majority across all the political groups .
mrs randzio-plath mentioned the mix between monetary policy and fiscal policy . inflation is now at historically low levels .
if we are to achieve this objective , a wide variety of measures are very urgently needed .
i hope that 1996 will not be a repeat of 1995 when we had a disappointing growth rate of 2.5 % .
that was some 0.3 % down on 1994 .
as one who comes from a peripheral rural constituency i appreciate the importance of a proper and adequate infrastructure .
we must have confidence in the economy .
i believe that 1999 cannot come quickly enough because the single currency will play an important role .
in the meantime we must ensure that there is greater currency stability . economic growth must be generated by the market and the private sector .
in the past two years in the union only one net private sector job was created compared with the united states where there were ten and japan which had four .
we must look very closely at this and we must remember that the engine of growth in the economy is largely the private sector .
the fundamental problems of the european economic and social muddle must be tackled urgently to stabilize the rate of employment if not reverse it .
time does not permit me to do this now but i hope i will have an opportunity later to discuss it with mr cassidy .
that cannot deliver .
this brings me back to the guidelines exercise .
there we are at the coal-face with the member states and what they can deliver .
i know this much about how we characterize what happens in the united states . we have converted and degenerated some of their employment creation capacity into a view that it is all fast-food economy .
in any case , reality has shown that those who dared to make such a forecast have been proved right .
but there is one point of agreement . both reports on economic policy confirm the impression that environment policy is only a stepchild .
it is time for the economists in this house to see that economy and environment are twins .
how can we concentrate on the enormous unemployment problem , which is indeed a real one , whilst closing our eyes to the ongoing deterioration of the environment ?
then we simply forget a very important item in our european housekeeping book .
and good economists know that in the long run that ends up in bankruptcy .
so i have tabled one or two amendments to mr cassidy 's report linking the need for a healthier environment to the promotion of employment .
the two may very well go together as moreover parliament has said previously .
there are environmental conditions and social boundaries which economic development must observe in order to be lasting .
economic growth cannot manage without these boundaries because the boundless and the measureless is not an environment in which mankind can live .
our quest for welfare must have certain limits , otherwise it will go wrong from the outset . so let us strive for sustainable economic development .
the revised prediction of 2 % growth in the european economy instead of 2.6 % means that the commission strategies as set forth in the white paper on growth , competitiveness and employment are ineffective .
instead of a reduction in unemployment , reduced growth will lead to an increase in unemployment .
the main reason for this development lies in the declining competitiveness of the eu member states ' economies in relation to other regions such as the united states or asia .
this also manifests itself in the fall in direct investments by companies from the oecd states or from the united states and japan in europe , a decrease which has been quite dramatic in some cases .
europe is feeling the pinch and is becoming less and less attractive as a business location .
this means on the one hand that companies are deterred from engaging new staff and on the other hand that confidence in europe as a location is dwindling .
this shows that he has cast himself free from certain restraints , something which i respect and would like to welcome .
mr president , our problem at this time is that we want to create the single currency . that is the next great step in the building of europe .
but economic circumstances are making it difficult , and are doing that because of the familiar reasons of slowing down economic activity and increasing unemployment .
we must first stress that the single currency is not responsible for unemployment .
it is not easy to understand how working people , who feel their jobs threatened by cuts in public expenditure , will acquire the feel-good factor and increase demand by spending more .
it is more likely that such a psychological reaction would come as the result of long term stabilization , but this long term stabilization and its psychological result may take five or ten years to come about .
what we are interested in is something much more immediate , and we do not have it at this time .
mr president , we are asked to consider the example of the united states and the elastic labour market .
it is time we recognized that unemployment is ultimately a distribution problem , the distribution of income and wealth .
commissioner , under the umbrella of fighting unemployment you spoke of cutting the deficits . you spoke of the single currency and structural measures .
it is today unquestionable that growth and job-creation are being made difficult by the rigour imposed in respect of fulfilling the maastricht criteria .
we do not call into question that they have been established , having led to the necessary and successful effort to diminish deficits , bring down inflation , interest rates , public debt and budget deficit .
in the second place unemployment , as has also been said here throughout the evening , is continuing at unacceptably high levels .
the conclusion to be drawn from this overview is that something is lacking in the theoretical reasoning of recent times .
according to the recent frequentlyrepeated analysis , growth should occur as a natural consequence of the policy of stability and rationalization of the fundamentals of the economy .
this is what the commission calls the ' paradox of the lack of confidence ' , in spite of the favourable economic fundamentals .
mr president , work , sustainable long-range economic development and good quality of life are important values for us as individuals .
when a market is integrated solely in response to the dictates of the economy , other human values are downgraded .
perhaps the greatest weakness in the commission 's annual report is the lack of this insight and the absence of new and alternative strategies for the future , which i would like to see more of .
paragraph 23 conveys a certain surprise that public expenditure in the union amounts to around 50 % of gdp .
general tax reductions do not solve any problems . what usually happens is that the distribution of incomes becomes more uneven , which in its turn leads to reduced demand , since those on high incomes will save more .
that , mr president , is precisely why the many tax reforms during the 1980s and 1990s , in sweden for example , did not bring down unemployment but increased it .
we need more cultural institutions , upgraded ports and roads . a strong public sector with a well developed social insurance system is the surest way to strengthen people 's confidence in the future .
first , let me answer a few of the specific questions asked , especially by your rapporteur . you complain that we have provided no statistics for 1996 .
mr president , i hope that remark of yours is duly recorded and will be illuminated in neon signs outside parliament .
as honourable members will know , the directive before the house today seeks to harmonize the conditions for obtaining national boatmasters ' certificates for the carriage of goods and passengers by inland waterway in the community .
it provides for a single national boatmaster 's certificate conferred on the basis of harmonized conditions and drawn up in accordance with a community model which is mutually recognized by member states .
i understand that the commissioner has now accepted the compromise in the council on these points .
but i think we in the committee on transport still wonder whether the commissioner has not accepted the council 's ideas too quickly .
i said myself that it had been declared inadmissible by the presidency .
suffice to say that this is the final step under euro ii , at a time when discussions in the corridors and elsewhere have already turned to euro iii .
our concern is naturally to have this implemented as soon as possible in the interests of the producers , for example , to let them know at long last which standard is to apply from next year .
to this end , a number of directives have previously lowered the thresholds for emissions of certain toxic gases - carbon monoxide and non-burned hydrocarbons - originating from petrol and diesel engines .
the standards have been applied to all private vehicles , irrespective of their engine capacity .
but fortunately the council was more progressive . that has meant a tightening up of the commission 's original proposal with regard to emission standards .
so once again the council enhances a proposal whilst the commission to some extent mars it .
why should we extend it by one year ?
naturally we shall vote also for the two other amendments . following the maastricht treaty the european parliament must be consulted , as we have made clear in amendments nos 1 and 3 .
this has led our fellow-member to think it more appropriate to remain in germany .
in fact the amendments already approved by parliament contained more advanced suggestions which we should certainly have preferred .
the substance of amendment no 2 , which mr lange mentioned , poses no problems for the commission either .
the worst thing that can happen to us is that the council will refuse to deal with the new proposals until the present one is adopted .
mr president , my report is concerned with setting up a committee of experts which the commission will consult with .
in the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights there has been no real problem with the substance of the commission proposal . most of the discussion has centred around the procedure to be followed .
i congratulate my colleagues in the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights for their tenacity in demanding that a fast-track approach was not appropriate in this situation .
i and my colleagues on the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights feel that democratic principles demand the maximum involvement of the european parliament .
the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights wishes the committee which is to be set up to be in a form that enhances the democratic accountability of this committee .
we accept that at present there is a modus vivendi between the three institutions but we assert that wherever possible parliament should be consulted and that the council should also be involved in changing legislation .
in these and similar cases , it was small savers and ordinary taxpayers who suffered .
since what was involved here was mainly speculation on a supranational scale , it is easier to accept controls in respect of these matters than in many other fields .
as regards the relationship between the commission 's and the legal affairs committee 's proposals , the differences do not appear that great , either on matters of principle or in practical respects .
the new committee will take up duty alongside the banking advisory committee and the insurance committee : we shall thus have all the committees needed to see that the single market in securities operates properly .
mr president , it is a pity that the rapporteur is not here . contrary to my stern nordic habit of not engaging in personal exchanges , i had thought of plying her with praise for an excellent report .
it is naturally entirely bound up with the fact that 90 % of those with hiv infections are in developing countries .
the commission has already done a great deal in this area , and the presentation of this proposal for a regulation is just one element of a concerted action undertaken by the commission over several years .
it was not easy at the start .
there are a lot of preconceived notions , cultural obstacles and difficulties of how to approach these very sensitive problems that have to be overcome before any effective action can be instituted on the ground .
as i am short of time , let me finish by saying that within the committee on women 's rights we laid particular emphasis on two things . first , there is the matter of children .
i am fully aware that the resources this regulation will make available to us will not enable us to do everything , but we know that , increasingly , children are falling victim to this disease and its consequences .
we really must pay special attention to them , especially in terms of prevention , because they are particularly vulnerable targets .
many of these children are living as orphans in villages where there is no one left to take care of them except the elderly . the committee on women 's rights emphasizes this point .
secondly , i believe that women are extremely important in all preventive schemes , not only in themselves but also because many of them are concerned with health care .
they are often behind the provision of primary health care and local activities .
frequently , too , they act as midwives , who can achieve a great deal in terms of prevention .
mrs andr&eacute;-l&eacute;onard made this point in her report and in the amendments we drafted , and i wanted to emphasize it here .
sadly , poverty and the danger of infection with aids go hand in hand .
we need to act quickly , because the fight to prevent the propagation of the epidemic is truly a race against the clock .
the number of people infected with the hiv virus today is estimated at 17 million . according to who projections , this figure is expected to reach 40 million by the year 2000 , on the most optimistic assumption .
the epidemic is affecting north and south alike , but the developing countries are by far the worst affected , with 80 % of those infected living in those countries .
in 1986 , the who set up a global programme to combat aids .
europe picked up the baton in 1987 and 1988 . the programme has been extended to all the developing countries .
in may 1994 , the council of development ministers adopted a resolution in this area .
the objective was to identify , on the basis of the lessons learned from experience , principles of policy and priority strategies for the future , governing both community aid and bilateral aid from the member states .
there are two points , at least , to which i would like to call honourable members ' attention . first , basic care is not sufficiently developed .
there is nothing more wretched that the thought that , in some countries , nothing is done for patients because the elementary structure to accept them is lacking .
we are not talking about research or other things of that kind , we are talking about basics .
secondly , apart from this basic care , that is to say the necessary drugs to enable the concomitant infections to be simply controlled , there is a second point to which i would call your attention .
i think mrs andr&eacute;-l&eacute;onard failed to stress it sufficiently , perhaps out of modesty .
we have tried to institute - and it will take all the commission 's efforts - a system which will be fairer towards the developing countries .
they will no longer be able to receive treatment because these very advances move treatment farther out of their reach . they are too expensive .
we have tried to introduce a system which will call for efforts to be made with the laboratories , with the health structures of our wealthy countries , and with the structures of the poorer countries .
that was the thinking behind our work on the committee on development and cooperation , and i am very grateful to mrs andr&eacute;-l&eacute;onard for having enabled this work to be done .
mrs andr&eacute;-l&eacute;onard , since you were away at the time , i must tell you that all your colleagues who spoke expressed their esteem for the quality of your work .
an important issue , as mr kouchner said , except that we began with only two people here !
ladies and gentlemen , i should like to thank the house for the interest it has shown in this matter and in particular to mrs andr&eacute;-l&eacute;onard for a report which we think is excellent .
according to united nations estimates , around 20 million people around the world have been infected with the hiv virus and we are still seeing an exponential increase in the epidemic in most countries .
around 90 % of persons infected live in developing countries and , within this group , about two-thirds live in africa .
to arrive at this , let us consider a few essential indicators .
the first is that in the year 2000 15 cities will number more than 11 million inhabitants , and that 13 of those 15 cities will be situated in the developing countries .
the main cause of this inflow into the urban areas is the search for jobs , schools and hospitals , as a result of which by 2030 65 % of the world 's population will be living in towns .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as draftsman of the opinion of the committee on the environment , i do not have much to add to what mrs taubira-delannon said as the main rapporteur for this report .
i should like to send just two or three messages to the commissioner - whom i greet - and the commission . the first is the budget for this project .
i must say that the values mentioned , 13 to 15 million ecus , are far too low . they will hardly make a dent in the problem .
the commission , which must now draft the preliminary draft budget for next year , ought to think about parliament 's amendment and gradually build it up to reach 50 million ecus in a maximum of two years .
the second comment concerns flexibility in adopting such projects .
until now this has been the approach followed by the commission and we have backed this .
at least so far this has been avoided . that is why in the future this flexibility and operational capacity must be maintained .
thirdly , i refer to the role of ngos and communities . this is a small project , commissioner , it is not a project for major enterprises or major co-operation projects .
the first is water , which really is the crucial element for tomorrow .
it will be one of the most costly commodities in our societies , and one of the most difficult to obtain .
i believe it is important that this should be one of the priorities we defend .
secondly , there is energy .
that is why any development of renewable energy sources and solar energy is important in this programme .
the issue here is not the encouragement of consultancy bureaux , important though they are .
it is important that knowledge should be recognized before any action is taken , but it remains true that the local population must be at the centre of the development of these programmes .
this aspect is addressed in the taubira report , but many other important points are raised there too .
let me mention amendment no 36 , which i believe to be very important .
what is being called for here is an environmental monitoring unit in directorate-general viii , and i believe it is very important that environmental protection is incorporated into all projects in the developing countries .
on the other hand , i also consider amendment no 27 important , because we do not want to deplete the limited funds available for special environmental protection in order to cushion the effects of some environmentally destructive megaprojects .
i have problems - and so does my group - with amendment no 48 , which calls for aid to be focused on biosphere reserves and similar areas .
but i think there are only a few points of disagreement . the priorities are clear .
the rapporteur 's report stresses areas for priority action already mentioned by other speakers : preserving biological diversity , improvement of the urban environment , preservation of coastal areas and the like .
there is also an amendment closely related to the present situation as regards meetings in this parliament .
it is amendment no 28 which , at least in the spanish version , refers to prior consent of the indigenous peoples when they are affected by pilot projects .
mr president , this draft legislation combines two aims .
i regard this as a shameful amount , too clearly indicative of neglect .
i do not believe we should finance expensive studies in western countries for projects in the developing world ; we should do far better to support specific projects in the field .
we should recognize what this funding cut means .
it begs the question whether rio was a lot of hot air about nothing .
the amount cited here is really and truly a pittance .
i do not think it is anything for us to crow about .
mr president , during the last few months this report has been one of the most important along with the one we have just spoken about .
this cooperation is reflected in amendment no 3 in which we ask for a stocking-up of the budget by the year 2000 to ecu 50m .
secondly , there was also disagreement .
working in politics often involves disagreements .
one could argue that this is not very useful for the commission to work with because it is not always clear but it should be seen as a warning .
others have said the same in the context of biodiversity .
biodiversity is not only a case of protecting the third world it is also an important issue for the future of all humankind . we all know that our future medicines and food are in biodiversity .
if we lose the biodiversity we are losing our future . that is why mr pimenta was fighting for this division and we should debate that again .
that is what we are discussing at present with dg xi of the commission and its fifth environment action programme . the biggest problem of the whole idea of environment is implementation and integration .
for example , huge tracts of mature forests are being cut away without any provision whatsoever for replanting or preparation of the land for other useful purposes .
a regulatory regime must be imposed on foreign companies forcing them to replant the areas they have clear-felled and generally making a serious effort to reinstate where damage is done .
ladies and gentlemen , it is perhaps a platitude to say that sustainable development is a challenge for all of us .
environmental problems continue to get worse in developing and industrialised countries alike .
we have some members of the house who are in these two committees and together with the rapporteur we could get together with the commissioner to talk about policy in this field .
to this end the machinery existing in the industrial scheme has been taken over as it was for application to the agricultural sector .
this is one of the occasions on which the clich&eacute; that the principles of economic liberalism are contrary to social solidarity is most effectively refuted .
in reality such a measure - the provision as a whole -benefits both the developing countries ' trade and the european consumer .
the view favouring the developing countries which has always guided our actions must however prevail .
in the opinion of the committee on development the search for formulae which will encourage development naturally carries weight .
what actually happens with the tuna loins and preserved tuna ?
it is calculated , i would emphasize , that only between 15 and 20 % of the tuna imported from the annex v countries complies with the rules of origin .
mr president , the rapporteur has clearly set out the reasons that led to this report .
it would also make good sense to use this system to eliminate child labour , to reduce environmental destruction and to ban inhumane or ecocidal forms of production , like the flower trade as it is practised in colombia .
approval of the minutes
the minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
madam president , on the approval of yesterday 's minutes ; in paragraph 3 , mr macartney referred to the flying of the european flag .
very well , we will take note of your comments .
( parliament approved the minutes )
postal services
the words of cicero : ' how long will you abuse our patience ' , were often on my mind during those long days of waiting .
the report i bring to parliament today on behalf of the committee on transport and tourism is of great interest to the people of the european union .
postal services are without doubt at the sharp end of contact with the people in their towns and villages .
it is a european issue that they can not only understand but can see in their day-to-day lives .
there are very few issues in this parliament 's day-to-day work that can boast such recognition .
so this report is about not only the provision of postal services but also the provision of social services .
in many parts of the european union , it is impossible to separate the two .
for that reason in my report i have taken a different view to the commission regarding liberalization .
i have quite openly and without apology taken the view that the protection of national postal administrations is essential if that social element is not to be lost to the ravages of liberalization or even privatization .
in its proposal the commission accepts that there is a need for a reserved national monopoly sector that would enable national postal organizations to provide that universal service .
as far as i am aware , only mr wijsenbeek and the liberal , democratic and reformist group cannot agree with this particular principle .
where there is a difference between myself and the commission is the issue of which services should remain in the reserved sector .
i , supported by my colleagues on the committee on transport and tourism , believe that both direct mail and cross-border mail should be maintained in the reserved area .
my reasons for this are clear .
if the proposals put forward by the commission are put into practice , the effect on our citizens , particularly those in rural and peripheral areas will be catastrophic .
these areas are not profitable when shown on a balance sheet and so will be the first to suffer under liberalization .
that is why i have always argued that the reserved sector must be large enough to sustain a universal service and must , of necessity , contain direct mail and cross-border mail .
as rapporteur i am grateful for the work done by colleagues in the secretariat in preparing this report and by my colleagues in the committee .
also , the help of those working in the postal sector has been invaluable .
this report is about people and those old , but nevertheless important , values like public service and people 's need . it is a report which protects postal services .
it is a report which ensures a service to the public , irrespective of where they live .
it is a report that recognizes the work done by thousands of postmen and postwomen for their communities .
last , but not least , it is a report that puts public service before private profit .
in commending the report to parliament , i would say to the commission that if it doubts what i say is true it should ask the people of europe .
for once in its collegiate life it should listen to what the citizens have to say .
they do not want their post liberalized and i am sure this parliament will take exactly the same view .
madam president , while thanking brian simpson for his report , i should like to extend my thanks to the commission for the sensible draft directive on which it is based .
added to this is the fact that we have fifteen member states , each with its own postal service to which it has both allegiance and pride .
the committee on economic and monetary affairs and industrial policy produced an opinion which sought to strengthen and modify where necessary the commission 's draft directive .
our measures included the gradual and controlled opening-up of the market .
it floated the possibility of a eurostamp for the future .
we also sought to give consumers better protection from inadequate service .
we also made proposals which fell in line with fair competition .
that initiative certainly was not a programme for retraining those unemployed or made redundant within the industry .
these six measures were aimed at enabling the postal service industry to sustain worthwhile and rewarding jobs by providing a service that people want in the form they want it and at a price they can afford .
madam president , parliament 's committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights has carefully examined the draft directive on the development of community postal services and the improvement of quality of service .
like mr simpson , and in the same spirit , we approve of the main thrust of this text , subject to a number of points which i will now set out .
madam president , i come from a country which is proud of its tradition of public services in general , and of the postal service in particular .
we believe that the right of our fellow citizens to public services is a fundamental constitutional right which we must defend and promote .
we have seen in france over the last decade exactly what a remarkable capacity to adapt our major public services are able to display during times of rapid technological change .
this implies an open and dynamic view of the public service and of its global economic balance , and not a static and residual view of a public service reduced to the bare vestiges .
i congratulate in this respect the recent decisions of the luxembourg court in the corbeau and almelo commune cases which take account of this dynamic and global dimension .
the injection of a dose of competition can serve as a useful incentive for modernization and competitiveness .
but this is not an aim in itself .
it must not have the result of upsetting balances within the public service , of weakening its dynamism and its prospects for the future .
in this connection , the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights would like to make the following points .
first , we believe the legal basis proposed by the commission to be correct .
at one time the committee on transport and tourism had proposed to add article 77 of the treaty as a basis .
we believe that this is a subsidiary provision which could not provide an autonomous legal basis and which would threaten to weaken parliament 's prerogatives .
we are therefore against this proposal .
secondly , the liberalization of direct mail poses a difficult legal problem , linked to the confidentiality of correspondence .
we believe that it is almost impossible to isolate this sector of the market , even if it were desirable in terms of maintaining the service 's necessary general economic balance .
i believe this matter needs to be looked at again very closely .
mr wijsenbeek knows who i am referring to !
fifthly and finally , a draft communication , the notice , is also submitted for our consideration .
it is in the form of an instrument for security , stability and transparency .
this notice must be brought into line with the directive , as otherwise it will prove to be an instrument for insecurity , dissonance and obscurity .
madam president , i welcome mr simpson 's report .
this house owes him a debt for the tremendous amount of work he has put into it despite much opposition .
if this study were to prove that liberalization will have a harmful impact on the social and economic development of , in particular , peripheral and outlying areas , then it should not go ahead .
of course we all agree with the notion of competition .
madam president , before my election as an mep i was a postal worker and an elected lay local official of the postal workers union , the communication workers union , with which i am still strongly connected .
postal services are performed by a necessary network of such people .
each member state should have a comprehensive universal postal service at an affordable uniform tariff .
in order for this universal service to be provided , it is necessary to reserve enough of the profitable postal services of the post office so that the post offices can also finance their unprofitable services .
that is why it is so important to keep in the reserved sector the integrated collection , sorting , distribution and final delivery of the mail as well as cross-border mail and direct mail .
the prime aim of the private sector companies , which are trying to get the eu to allow them to cream off the profitable parts of the postal service , is to make a good profit for their shareholders .
my constituents , who are all consumers , and the rest of the british people have rejected the conservative government 's plans to privatize the post office .
they do not want to see bit-by-bit privatization , as profitable postal services are hived off to the private sector under the guise of eu competition policy .
they want to see good , regulated , affordable , universal postal services which can be guaranteed with good quality-of-service regulations .
in conclusion , do not worship the new market gods of competition at all costs , liberalization and deregulation .
public service is more important than private profit .
defend our european public postal services .
let me begin by raising four points which we in the group of the european people 's party regarded as central to our work on this proposal for a directive .
first , the efforts which some member states have already made to liberalize their postal services must not be cancelled out by the european union .
the postal services are fully or almost fully liberalized in scandinavia while there are some other european countries that have not yet made any efforts as regards their postal services .
the margin for play must , however , lie with the member states , we cannot prescribe what to do from europe .
secondly , we want as much competition as possible , as much monopoly as necessary .
i place great value on that too .
on the one hand we need competition to improve quality - you can speak later , florus , will you please let me speak in peace now !
- and also in order to control prices .
on the other hand we need a long-term secure provision for the rural and peripheral areas of the european union .
and that is why we also need a monopoly .
thirdly , we note that the quality of cross-border postal traffic is pathetic .
i say that quite plainly : it is pathetic .
you are all familiar with the rule that holiday postcards to friends and relatives always arrive a week after your return from holiday .
we could never establish the situation as it unfortunately actually is through a directive .
we want uniform and good quality standards throughout europe .
fourthly , we want a fair distribution of charges for cross-border post , a very important point that has already been made .
unfortunately the commission did not grasp this nettle .
i think we will take a good decision on this question in parliament today , which i hope the council will also accept .
these principles i have sketched out are reflected in the amendments which the group of the european people 's party has tabled again .
naturally we do not want that .
amendment no 81 to article 14 determines how the question of remailing and the payment of terminal dues for incoming mail from abroad should be regulated for the long term .
i would also like to point out that we should take the german version of this amendment as our basis , because the different language versions interpret it differently ; i consider that very important .
finally , in amendment no 72 to article 15 we propose that the question of crosssubsidies between the reserved sector and the competition sector should be examined not by the national regulative body but by an independent auditor .
the advantage of that is that the universal service does not then have to make all its calculations available to the public .
we do not want to allow crosssubsidies but nor do we want measures that distort competition to be prescribed here .
i regard that as a good road to pursue .
let me thank all members , and particularly mr simpson , for their cooperative attitude and for enabling us to discuss the various points in a spirit of friendly cooperation .
this is not clause 4 economics , it is santa claus economics .
madam president , i should like to ask the commission how it can be that a taxpayer has to keep on paying for abominable service .
let us take italy . 29 % of the post arrives according to the standards laid down .
that can only improve if we have open and free provision of services .
if we do not improve the post and we as a parliament no longer champion the consumer , what have we been elected for ?
why cannot we champion the consumer ?
we , as the liberal group , are the only ones willing to do so today .
the proposals of the union of european consumers have not even been taken into account by the rapporteur .
it is too depressing for words .
i have got two minutes here .
i have raised one or two questions , but i shall just leave it at that , because only keeping quiet and crying serve any purpose here .
madam president , first i should like to convey my sincere thanks and gratitude to mr simpson for a wonderful report based on common sense and pragmatism .
i hope those aspects of the report will be taken on board by the commission .
there appears to be a total lack of understanding there of what postal services are all about .
the simpson report strikes the balance between improving the present service levels and ensuring that a universal service can be offered to all the citizens of the european union , irrespective of where they live .
i come from a country where we are very proud of our public services .
indeed , our postal service is one of the best in europe .
it is highly efficient , a daily service to all sectors of the community in all parts of the country at a reasonable price .
we have good postal services accompanied by a quality social service which is of immense value .
these two services go hand in hand and cannot be separated .
therefore it is imperative that we protect our postal system .
i readily admit that there is always room for improvement .
public customer demand will ensure that this is never forgotten and there is always constant pressure on our postal administrations to meet these public pressures .
i genuinely believe that the commission proposals in this area would be disastrous if implemented .
we might benefit in the heavily populated urban areas , the normally profitable areas , but at a very great cost to the non-urban areas .
quite obviously the profitable areas are needed to support the non-profitable areas , otherwise the postal system , as we know it , collapses .
madam president , after having launched deregulation in telecommunications , energy and transport , the european commission now wants to subject the postal services to the rules of competition .
the aim is to cream off the most profitable sectors for the benefit of large private companies , reducing the public service to a minimum level , as expressed by the notion of a ' universal service ' .
once again the commission has made no assessment of the social consequences of the directive .
and yet the direction taken is extremely serious .
if the directive were adopted in its present form , its application would destroy uniform tariffs , that is , equal treatment and access for users .
it would result in the dismantling of the public monopoly , with the hiving off or privatization of the most profitable activities .
users , and individuals and small businesses in particular , would then receive a poorer quality service .
the status of employees would be called into question and job losses would follow , as they did in the case of liberalization in spain , finland and sweden .
also , the commission itself recognizes in its explanatory memorandum that ' the process of adaptation will lead to job cuts for the postal operators ' .
these operators employ one and a half million people .
no reformer or humanist can view communication as a simple commodity to be subjected exclusively to the laws of the marketplace .
it is a right which must be recognized by everybody .
it plays an essential role in social and economic cohesion .
in france , postal workers and trade unions were actively involved in the social movement at the end of 1995 in order to defend the public service .
acting on our proposal , the committee on transport and tourism is calling for the development of postal services to be coupled with an improvement in the living and working conditions of postal workers .
we refuse to subject postal services to the rule of money .
we are in favour of upward harmonization by developing cooperation between national operators .
we demand the maintenance and development of a quality public service , free of strictly financial dictates and respecting the status of employees and the equal treatment of all users .
madam president , mr simpson 's report is right in trying to water down a little the commission 's proposal for a directive on the postal services .
as far as i am concerned liberalization and throwing open the market for postal services must have a clear objective and liberalization must not be an end in itself , not an ideology or an article of faith .
if you look at the pre-conditions for liberalization , scarcely anything has been done at european level .
mr wijsenbeek perhaps lives round the corner from the netherlands government and the queen .
naturally the reorganization of postal services and operation of the market is motivated by increased efficiency and that naturally occurs also under the pressure of normal market forces .
users are losing an important part of the service and employees are losing their jobs .
the commission recognizes the universal nature of the postal service but it is trying to push its liberalization ideology through .
usually the two things by definition do not always go together .
that seems obvious to me .
i think the rapporteur 's approach is reasonable .
experience in the various member states also shows that the postal services are important if not vital links in a policy of social and economic cohesion .
but this report further gains in importance due to the fact that , by regulating the activities , the commission 's text guarantees the safeguard of the greatest number of jobs in this sector .
madam president , the quality of the postal services in the european union exhibits unacceptably wide variations .
a survey by price waterhouse confirmed that again not long ago .
that is against the consumer 's interest but above all , because of distortion of competition , it is harmful for businesses which are very dependent on the postal services .
the commission 's green paper concludes in that respect that it is not desirable to maintain the status quo .
meanwhile we are dealing here with a sector which often has a long-term and established position , not least from the point of view of employment .
changes must therefore take place little by little .
that is the approach taken in the commission proposal .
another crucial point is how big the monopoly sector must be to be able to maintain a universal service which everyone can afford .
in this respect the commission proposal with upper limits of 2 kg for letters and 10 kg for parcels does not go far enough .
the ferber amendment with limits of 1 kg and 10 kg which links up with agreements of the member states in the framework of the world postal union therefore deserves support .
employment is undoubtedly an important point .
but let us not forget that traditional post is falling off and the postal services are increasingly facing competition from new technologies .
controlled competition with incentives for innovation and modernization offers better protection for employment in these circumstances than maintaining the status quo .
madam president , i fully approve of the report by my colleague brian simpson , whom i congratulate on the excellent job he has done .
the many amendments he has introduced render the announced liberalization more acceptable and amount to a significant change of policy .
as an integrated public company the post office also creates many stable jobs .
it is an institution which structures the national territory , contributes to social cohesion and provides services which are essential to a nation 's economic life .
and you want me to joyfully assist in dismantling this company ?
in its description of the situation of the public service in europe , the commission should also take into account the example of efficient public services , rather than seeking to indiscriminately break up public companies .
madam president , mr fayot , i think we are living in two different worlds .
that this is the case is also shown by the marked economic success of the private courier services .
they are not successful because the postal service is so successful ; they are successful because the post is too slow , and that has to be said quite plainly !
even the protection the postal services enjoy now should not mislead them into leaving everything as it stands .
mr ferber has already spoken of the five days it takes for post from augsburg to reach brussels .
but the postal sector has particular requirements due to its role in ensuring economic and social cohesion .
the postman is sometimes the only person whom elderly people or those living in isolated rural areas encounter on a regular basis .
this is why we must show pragmatism rather than an ultra-liberal doctrinaire approach .
the method chosen by the commission of presenting a communication on the application of the rules of competition in the postal sector is in this respect a dangerous departure which should be firmly condemned .
i should like to thank the rapporteur , mr simpson , for his excellent work .
my group is in overall agreement with his proposals which seek to maintain a universal service of quality .
but i should like to make three points .
the universal service has a price .
it can therefore only be correctly assured if we maintain a reserved service .
we must look very carefully at the questions of direct mail and cross-border mail .
a new system of terminal dues is essential in this respect .
the directive 's review procedures are also unsatisfactory .
we must therefore provide for a review after a sufficient period .
thirdly , we cannot liberalize without concerning ourselves with the social consequences .
we need an in-depth study into this aspect as quickly as possible in order to avoid brutal adjustments .
the group union for europe is committed to preserving a universal postal service which guarantees equal access , adaptability and neutrality .
we therefore support this report and will continue to closely monitor developments .
in so doing , the report conforms to the position adopted by the council on 7 february 1994 , especially in taking measures to avoid the liberalization of direct mail and incoming cross-border mail .
we therefore support this report , also if there are amendments to improve it , such as those just set out by my colleague jacques donnay , which we will support .
i should also like to firmly contest the commission 's approach as presented in its communication .
this communication can be contested legally and also in terms of its content which is contrary to the directive .
by voting for the simpson report , with certain amendments , we will sending a very clear message to the commission not to tinker with the universal public service of the postal sector .
the long-awaited commission proposal has not led to rejoicing .
the balance is such that no-one was really satisfied : a compromise which for some went much too far and for others not nearly far enough .
what is now before us is a compromise upon a compromise and the question is whether we can really achieve anything with it .
good and efficient post and telecommunication services are of primary importance for the european union .
it should have been trans-european networks avant la lettre but it was not .
as things have gone liberalization of public services is meeting with more and more resistance .
the question is whether the backlash on the postal dossier will not in the long run have rather a negative effect on the provision of services and also on everyone working in the sector .
the european union ought to be able to rely on outstandingly good postal services .
in many countries they leave much to be desired . but in those countries an attempt should be made to move forward .
since that is not happening or is happening only incompletely the question is who will pay the bill for that , on the social side too , in the long run .
i am not happy about it .
all that does not diminish my great appreciation of the way the rapporteur has done his work .
the speed with which he has worked might serve as an example to many postal services in the member states .
madam president , today we can coin a new slogan : new labour , new unemployment .
i enjoyed mr simpson 's speech enormously .
i regret however , that at no time did he give any consideration to the consumer or the user of the service .
perhaps he could put my mind at rest that socialists are not frightened of competition or the introduction of new technologies .
i welcome the commission proposal and am against the socialist position as it is perceived today , namely blatant protectionism .
i have some difficulty with the position in holland and sweden as they have gone furthest down the road to liberalization .
the uk position is that we welcome the commission proposal with a limited introduction of competition and would like to consider new technologies .
i invite the rapporteur and members of the socialist group to be bold and to welcome a limited degree of competition .
i would like to see maintenance of the universal service which is especially important to the delivery of post in remote rural areas .
also , there will continue to be a limited area in reserve .
this should be reviewed in 1998 as envisaged in the directive but we should not have any preconceived ideas at this stage about the nature and extent of further liberalization .
i invite the rapporteur to put the interests of the consumer and the user of the service first .
i commend the proposal to the house and i beg its support for my amendments nos 73 and 74 .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , when discussing the future of the postal services today we are bound to find that the commission 's proposals look very odd .
on the one hand it has presented a proposal for a directive , on the other hand we have the notice on competition rules in the postal sector .
the somewhat divergent provisions and intentions of the two documents have created disturbance and uncertainty among all the postal operators , employees and consumer representatives concerned .
that is why i am very pleased that mr brian simpson , our rapporteur , has sorted this out with his clear and very realistic proposals .
today the european parliament must state very clearly that in such an important economic branch , the directive in the framework of co-decision has to be the sole yardstick .
the report brings out the main points : a universal service that really can ensure the basic provision of post for all consumers , even in outlying areas .
the reserved service , which really can support a universal service without the need for public aid to be granted .
realistic time-tables for implementing the directive and procedures for amending the reserved services to make it clear what implications further moves towards liberalization will have for the employment situation .
we all know the stereotype answer of the liberalizers already .
private postal services are efficient and public postal services can only operate with subsidies .
the approach the commission should encourage in future is as follows : regulate competition and public provision in such a way that profits are not always privatized and losses socialized !
hence deregulation becomes self-evident , otherwise the conditions are not equal .
the burden of proof in showing that the alternative is better should rest with those who claim that it should not be subject to equal conditions .
experience where such deregulation has been implemented is good .
in sweden , for example , a country with some very sparsely populated areas , deregulation works well .
the detractors often claim that many people lost their jobs when deregulation came into effect .
that is not the case .
on the contrary , new postal operators have taken on a large number of people .
the biggest private postal operator in sweden will have a thousand employees by the end of the year .
it is true that post offices have been closed .
however , that has more to do with technical development and increases in efficiency than with the process of deregulation .
this technical development has presumably created many , many more jobs than it has taken away .
mr president , i began by saying that different countries have different experience of the deregulation of postal services .
this leads on to my second point and my second conclusion , namely that those countries which have deregulated their postal services must not be forced to re-regulate them .
in the same way , those countries that want to deregulate must be allowed to do so .
it is also important to remember that we shall never have an efficient postal service in europe , unless we recognize the postal sector as part of industry as a whole .
mr president , as rapporteur , brian simpson 's task was not an easy one .
the rapporteur managed to bridge those differences and improve the original proposal for a directive , taking into account not only the economic consequences brought by liberalizing the postal market , but its social consequences as well .
more specifically , this report ensures the uninterrupted provision of a universal service , with the result that even the union 's most far-flung regions will be adequately served .
this is achieved by the retention of postal advertising and by cross-border correspondence - incoming and outgoing - in the reserved sector .
a postal service must therefore be economically viable if it is to continue serving all such regions .
mr president , i know that monopolies , and especially public monopolies , have the annoying habit of becoming comfortably institutionalized and that liberalization and healthy competition can do them a lot of good in improving their service .
but when applying the rules of competition to the postal service , you must be careful not to throw the baby out with the bath water .
i will not vote for any amendment which would result in any diminishing of the universal service currently provided in my own country where the post office is an efficient public company which is working well .
but a well-defined universal service must also ensure continuity of good quality service .
this amendment did not find favour with fellow members but i hope it will attract the attention of mr bangemann and the council .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the house has finally come to decide on the delicate matter of the liberalization of the postal sector .
i say finally , as this is a long-standing debate .
it was launched in 1989 and it has taken nearly seven years to obtain some kind of legal framework , which proves just what a difficult task this is .
because we want to avoid any plan which would produce economic doubts and social failings .
this is why i should like to personally congratulate mr simpson who in this report has succeeded in striking the difficult balance between harmonizing measures and the gradual opening up of the market .
i believe it is essential for the public service tasks of the postal administrations to be preserved , and for this they must be left the means to accomplish their mission .
our proposal regarding the content of the reserved sector covering direct mail and international mail meets this requirement .
however , i regret the commission 's opposition but hope , commissioner , that we will later arrive at a wiser point of view .
mr president , i should just like to say before mr bangemann speaks that it was remiss of me in my speech when i thanked people for their assistance to omit to mention the commission .
while we have great differences of opinion , that does not detract from the hard work the commission has done on this report .
i want to put the record straight and record my thanks to them .
mr president , it is not just for his last comment that i want to thank the rapporteur but also for the work he has done and the speed with which he has done it .
it is true , it took a long time for us to make our proposal .
the rapporteur quoted cicero , which is appropriate for a member of parliament .
let me , however , deal right at the outset with some remarks that still echo these misunderstandings .
the fact that we presented a proposal for a directive based on article 100a makes two things quite clear .
it is important to consider the alternatives .
to have a directive describing the direction the postal services can follow in the next few years will certainly give us more security than not having it .
if we do not have it , the services will develop very differently from member state to member state .
situations of competition will arise that are not regulated .
remailing has been mentioned .
it was described as piracy .
two days ago , i think , a german court decided in the case of a complaint by the german federal post office that remailing cannot be forbidden .
i think the fact that we are proposing this directive is an advantage in itself .
of course it is no guarantee that all the results of the directive will prove acceptable , which is why we have to continue talking .
but i think for the time being we are following the right direction .
my second comment is about the notice .
i have tried to explain this before .
a notice , and here i am addressing my good friend mr cot , is not a legal instrument in itself nor can it be .
of course that will not happen .
but i would ask you not to underrate this notice .
it is also a step towards cooperation with parliament for , as you know , the necessary powers exist in the treaty under article 90 .
the commission could make us of them but it does not want to proceed in this area without a discussion about using these powers , and that is the point of this notice .
what are the main objectives ?
i do not believe we are in disagreement about our aims after this discussion .
we want the guarantee of a compulsory universal service that is offered to all citizens throughout the community at acceptable prices and of good quality .
there is no contradiction !
this definition is established in the directive .
the definition of the universal service does not mean that we have also laid down the ways by which this universal service can be achieved .
if these aims can be achieved by way of competition , of a deregulated market , then why not ?
i have said on several occasions and will repeat again , in response also to what my friend florus wijsenbeek said : let us not enter into ideological disputes here !
after all , we have the practical experience .
the commission and i personally have nothing at all against service publique .
and i quite certainly do not want to underestimate the role of postmen and post offices in rural areas .
i myself live in a small village with some 25 inhabitants , 10 cats and 5 dogs and we are all glad to see the postman .
that is not the problem .
the problem is how to ensure that this service continues to be provided for all citizens .
that is the big question .
i saw a placard held aloft outside the doors of this house by a member of this house whom i hold in very high regard .
it says in effect : up with the public service , down with profits - as has been said during the debate too .
that is not the problem at all .
we can have public law postal services if they manage to stand up to competition , which they actually do in some cases , and that is of course well and good .
after all we are not just talking theory here in a vacuum .
i think the netherlands may be a bad example because it is an open country with a relatively balanced distribution of population and few remote islands and so forth .
but there is also the example of sweden .
now sweden really is a country with a relatively unequal population spread .
the population is concentrated in stockholm and malm&ouml; and the regions round them while there are very empty areas in the north of sweden .
yet the universal service works .
everyone everywhere receives the same high-quality service at the same price .
i think it is a good idea to take a look at practical examples of this kind .
the commission has tried to do so .
we said that if we want to achieve this quality of service , then according to all the experience we have gained competition is still the best instrument .
let me say quite plainly to those who want to ideologize this instrument of competition , for us it is not an end in itself .
we are not for competition in order to ensure that there is competition in any particular area , but we are for competition as an instrument for achieving this kind of service .
and that is why we proposed that this should be achieved gradually and very carefully .
we can discuss the dates of the review , that is fair enough .
given that the directive is entering into force rather belatedly , one cannot start reviewing it a year later .
this needs discussion , but many of the amendments almost totally preclude this competition .
in doing so you would risk endangering the very existence of the universal service .
a few members have indeed pointed that out during this debate .
but surely no-one can overlook the fact that at any rate we have a technical development which could even undermine a monopoly service !
surly that is the real danger facing the delivery of mail , regardless of where you set the upper limit , regardless of how you define the reserved sector !
those are options that already exist and they will become much cheaper .
that means we must now start trying to direct the postal service along the lines of making it more modern and incorporating other services in it .
that means that if such a post office really wants to perform a social function and also survive , it must be a multi-function centre and not just a place for posting or picking up mail .
that is one of the consequences .
but if we want to achieve that , we must not tackle these things too slowly .
that is why we are not satisfied with the amendments tabled by the rapporteur regarding the pace of liberalization and its nature and scale .
by defining harmonized criteria we also want to establish for the first time a guarantee of the financial efficiency of the providers of the reserved services too .
that has not been mentioned at all .
for the first time you have a legal basis for ensuring that a provider of universal services is also adequately remunerated for this , for the first time !
that means , this way of financing is the only guarantee , mr simpson , for maintaining these services .
that is why we must open this market up by means of gradual and controlled liberalization and , as mr van der waal rightly said , in careful stages .
this really is not an overhasty deregulation that would have particularly adverse effects on the labour market situation .
let me say it again quite clearly , we have not brought up the question of privatization .
i think that would really be rather illogical .
if you want an effective public service too , a service publique , but do not consider it competitive in relation to private operators , then surely there must be something fishy !
you cannot be against competition if you have the interests of the consumer at heart .
that has been said here on several occasions .
in the end , after all , it is the consumer for whom this public service is created .
it was also underlined here that there is a long tradition of public service ; that is true , but what makes up that tradition ?
is it having a small group of employees who have particular , secure working conditions , or is it to organize the service better for the consumer ?
i think the tradition of public service is the latter and not the former .
the french revolution did not abolish the privileges of the nobility in order to create new privileges for post office workers , at least not in my view .
( laughter ) i cannot give my position on all the amendments in detail .
in any case this is the first reading .
let me present the commission 's conclusions .
we want to create a balance between harmonization and liberalization .
the universal service is defined in such a way as to give central priority to consumer interests and the quality of the services , which is to be achieved by opening up the market more .
liberalization has already become a reality in some large areas .
( applause ) i would ask you please to take note of that , for that is the reality , it is not a liberal or market programme or competition-mania or whatever you might call it .
we need enough time , we proposed that , and the safety nets we proposed will always flank the measures .
moreover , as i said , the financing is assured .
for the first time an unequal financial burden can be balanced , either by tying the licences to conditions or , as you know , by contributions to a compensation fund .
at each stage of the review procedure the liberalization measures can be evaluated .
we do not rise up in arms like cato - let me translate this into dog latin - and say : servitium postalis est delendum .
that is not our principle .
we want to help the postal service to become effective and efficient and thereby create a new image of public service .
( applause )
as most members will know , when sweden privatized and introduced competition before their entry into the european union , it allowed the previous state monopoly to undercut the new competitors and then buy them out .
so that information to this house was wrong .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 11.30 am .
european year against racism
the next item is the report ( a4-0135 / 96 ) by mr oostlander , on behalf of the committee on civil liberties and internal affairs , on :
mr president , racism and xenophobia are unfortunately deeply embedded in european culture .
it is not just a modern phenomenon but something that has been alive for centuries and came to a tragic nadir in the second world war .
it is a phenomenon which has marred or terminated millions of human lives in europe .
even in respectable parties there are sometimes political leaders who play on feelings of xenophobia .
those are things against which we must caution one another with extreme seriousness .
so we must not be na&iuml;ve and name any names , thus providing them with extra publicity and notoriety .
we shall have to avoid that in this report .
so i call upon all my fellow-members to take discerning view .
do not name names .
we shall have to work to ensure that people who are legally moving in our union countries can more easily acquire the nationality of the member states and thus may be able to benefit from the union .
that is an important point for the integration of minorities and the prevention of discrimination against them ; they must become full citizens .
naturally there must also be in the media and with the advertisers , as is often the case , a clear awareness that their activity must not give any occasion for fomenting feelings of xenophobia in our society .
to be brief , as decentralized as possible , so that people can assume their responsibilities .
these institutions are not there to be brow-beaten by government institutions but they are intended as a facility for coordinating their activity which keeps the network together .
so the commission must publish a regular report on the observatory 's activities and research , including research into policy which might be pursued , also at a decentralized level .
for that we have leonardo and socrates , in which facilities may be found .
i think that is an important signal , to the islamic world amongst others , that we are in earnest about them .
mr president , we are celebrating the european union today .
with it we are celebrating also the incontrovertible answer to racism and xenophobia .
i hope that will also be expressed today in the voting .
mr president , many thanks to the rapporteur for this excellent report .
i would like to point out that parliament has not just waiting until the conclusions of the cannes european council to take an initiative on these terrible questions .
as early as the 1980s the european parliament was convinced that this problem of racism must be combated .
during the last legislative term mr nordmann was the chairman of the committee of inquiry .
to turn now to the financial aspects .
ecu 5.4 m has been earmarked for this project in 1966 .
fortunately this is now to be increased for 1997 .
i hope the commission is aware that ecu 4.7 m are earmarked for 1997 , which is still a modest amount .
i believe that the nine-month preparation period is not just too long but also swallows up too much money .
confusion reigns as to the number of officials to be involved : first the commission refers to one grade a and one grade c official , then to 3 a grade officials .
as for item a-2510 ( comitology ) , the commission will have to clarify the impact of the committees .
moreover , it is enough to have one representative per member state on the committees .
it would be desirable to link up with item b3-300 in the field of information .
that would reduce the strain on this specific item , namely measures to combat racism , xenophobia and anti-semitism and allow it to be used more effectively .
a link-up with other institutions such as the council of europe would produce considerably more efficiency in future .
finally , a brief correction : the phrase programme de diffusion d ' images was mistranslated in the german text , namely by bildmaterial .
i would like to adhere to the french version , even though austria lost the football match against france yesterday !
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mr oostlander 's report is most welcome .
i regard it as a really good report and i also think the debate we have had on this report has helped us here in this parliament .
in my view it has helped bring about a broad consensus - as the vote will show - and wide agreement on how we evaluate the phenomenon of racism and xenophobia .
mr oostlander rightly pointed this out in his report .
one means of combating racism and xenophobia is to show personal courage and not to shrink back !
above all not to shrink back in the face of those who have made racism and xenophobia their programme .
you say that racism and xenophobia reached their peak during the second world war .
true !
one has to be allowed to say that if one is to combat racism and xenophobia !
( applause , heckling ) the information this report provides about many phenomena and their causes , that information must lead us to do more than simply adopting this report today !
mr president , we hope that on this subject of the fight against racism the unanimity achieved in the committee on civil liberties may be affirmed in the assembly too .
we are not shielded - not one of us : and we cannot shield ourselves simply by accusing others and palming the responsibility off on to others .
it is really a question of realpolitik , which reflects but does not solve the problem .
and then the promise - ' never again auschwitz ' - of which mr oostlander reminds us is not yet as widespread a common political heritage as it should be .
i have recalled these painful passages in the report because they are the very ones to make the proposal credible .
that is what concerns us .
that is why it is a good report .
but essential questions remain unanswered .
that says a lot about the fact that the schemes of the right and of the left are entirely left out .
we say ' yes ' to the european year against racism , ' yes ' to actions designed above all to help the integration of the various cultures in their diversity , with respect for the individuality of each .
we have less belief , we must say , in observatories which have frequently become in europe only a means of squandering a little public money and of giving some friend a salary .
i think that one very important basic fact has been undervalued : the cultural fact .
in particular , i should like to support the proposal for a council decision designating 1997 as european year against racism .
at a time when we are about to embark on enlargement negotiations , this would serve as a pertinent reminder .
this is why the liberal group supports it , confident in the hope that all the democratic groups in the house will adopt the same approach .
mr president , racism develops against a background of unemployment and social and cultural exclusion .
it is fuelled by the discourse of hatred .
racism is an offence and has nothing whatsoever to do with freedom of speech , and there are words which can be as lethal as any weapons .
to speak solely of france , mohamed azza was killed by a bullet in the forehead on 26 february 1995 .
that same week , ibrahim ali , a 17-year-old schoolboy from the comoro islands , was killed by a bullet in the back .
on 1 may 1995 , brahim bouaram was thrown into the seine and drowned during a demonstration by the national front .
on 4 may 1996 , in sens , mohamed qouas was gunned down .
the list would already be too long if i mentioned only the racist crimes to which militants of the national front have been linked - and this difference remains pertinent , mr cascalle .
because to this tragic list we must also add all those who have died at the hands of anonymous attackers , encouraged by the racist propaganda of the far right , and also others .
does a government which applies the pasqua laws , which are not only founded on the tarnishing of the immigrant but also seek to reinforce such prejudices , ever stop to think of the responsibility it bears ?
are we not arming these criminals in designating scapegoats for a social crisis which goes beyond any rational analysis ?
these crimes must not make us forget the day-to-day humiliations , the symbolic violence and the silent suffering .
to combat racism we must first strike at the root economic and social causes which nourish it .
we must also strengthen the legal instruments with which it can be repressed and conduct a global prevention campaign , in particular in the media and our schools .
the commission 's proposal for a european year against racism responds to these objectives .
at last we have a proposal of the european parliament which is being acted upon .
by better understanding others do we not better understand ourselves ?
in 1997 , we must ensure that initiatives are implemented in close cooperation with organizations active in combating racism so that the rejection of racism becomes a matter of concern to us all .
to fight against racism is to fight for democracy and to assume a fundamental mission .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , first of all i want to congratulate arie oostlander on his really very sensitive report .
i also want to convey to the commission my great respect for its communication and thank it for the commitment it has shown in this matter .
nothing has happened !
arie oostlander identifies central issues , for instance when he discusses the role of parties whose populist , xenophobic campaigns have incited racist attitudes towards refugees , immigrants , minorities such as the sinti and the romanies .
the forthcoming european elections in austria already give cause to fear that one party leader , haider , will stir up xenophobic feelings of resentment in order to catch more votes .
so racism does have a name and a face .
names must be named , i agree with martin schulz , because behind them we find the spiritual fathers of the bomb and arson attacks .
i particularly thank arie oostlander for breaking a taboo and finally also stating the right to freely practice other religious faiths in a european union that is increasingly projecting itself as a stronghold of the christian west .
we must stop creating hierarchies , as will happen with union citizenship if its excludes 10 to 14 million people from exercising their rights .
we need real protection against discrimination to be enshrined in the treaty and we need to put an end to every form of institutional racism and institutional discrimination .
but then of course the right hand must do what the left hand wants in the commission too .
it is better to kiss a leper than to shake hands with an idiot !
mr president , first i should like to congratulate mr oostlander on his balanced report which i hope the overwhelming majority of this house can vote for .
second , i agree with my colleague martin schulz when he says that we know that racism and xenophobia have to be on the agenda of this parliament .
a year against racism has been a long time coming .
almost a decade later it has now arrived .
i thank commissioner flynn for actually bringing forward this proposal which we have been waiting for , as i said , for over ten years .
i am slightly disappointed with the level of resources available but that is something we may deal with when we come to the budget round .
it also means that the commission has now clearly recognized that it has partial competence for dealing with racism and xenophobia .
we need to push that further in the intergovernmental conference by making sure that the necessary treaty changes are made to give the community competence to deal with racism , xenophobia and anti-semitism .
i also want to say that i am in favour of the establishment of the observatory .
the abstention was from the united kingdom not from the representative of the government of italy of which his party was a member .
i hope he will reconsider .
the observatory has to deal primarily with the problems of racism and xenophobia in the eu .
the commission proposal is a start but it is not enough .
in france the racists chant the mantra of ' three million immigrants , three million unemployed , three million immigrants too many ' .
the tune is the same around the rest of europe even if the numbers are different .
we should remember the slogan of the austrian nazi party in the 1930s : ' one million unemployed , one million jews , one million jews too many ' .
and we know what happened to the jews .
mr president , many people today , not least teachers and youth leaders , are confronted with neo-nazis , skinheads and other groups with unconcealed racist and anti-semitic views .
the proposal for a centre to coordinate and initiate action against racism is thus an easy one to support .
a great and important task should be assigned to this centre .
with such courses arranged on a broad front , europe would be better equipped for the work of giving our children and young people tolerant and humanistic ideals .
no teacher or youth leader in europe who seeks an understanding of the anatomy of racism and hatred must be allowed to stand in need of such knowledge .
this would be a proud promise for the european parliament to give on europe day .
mr president , one proposal in the report is out of harmony with the others .
legislation against racially motivated crimes is self-evident .
but we liberals are strongly opposed to legislating against views and prejudices as such .
they are best combated by argument and by spiritual and material wellbeing .
we in the liberal group reject legislation against parties .
it would be a victory for the anti-democrats and a defeat for faith in the power of argument .
in the commission 's proposal for a european year against racism and in the oostlander report , there is much good sense from which we can gain inspiration in our fight against racism , anti-semitism and xenophobia .
but the development and conclusion contributed by mr wiebenga 's amendment should further strengthen the proposal .
i will simply draw parliament 's attention to the consequences of point 20 which attempts to legislate on the history of world war ii .
this is what my country , france , did by adopting the gayssot act which led to a veritable intellectual chernobyl , now denounced by gaullist writers and deputies .
in seeking to ban professor forisson 's critical analyses of the written sources and lack of photos or drawings of the gas chambers , the gayssot act has added to their renown .
as free spirits say , if you need a law to impose a historical truth , then it ceases to be a historical truth and becomes a political truth .
and if you need a law to impose a scientific truth , then it ceases to be a scientific truth and becomes a religious dogma .
we believe that they deserve the same freedom as that which the european parliament is demanding for salman rushdie or taslima nasreen .
in any event , i solemnly warn mr oostlander that free citizens of a free europe will never accept the introduction of the thought police he seems to be calling for .
, member of the commission .
( sv ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , racism is not a new phenomenon in europe .
it is a problem that has marked much of our history .
racism is deeply rooted and affects all parts of the union .
it will require major efforts on the part of us all if we are to eradicate the scourge of racism , xenophobia and anti-semitism .
the fight against racism and xenophobia involves the commission as a whole .
we therefore welcome the excellent work done by parliament 's rapporteur , mr oostlander , and the committee on civil liberties and internal affairs .
the european parliament has long been calling for measures at union level against racism .
parliament has an important role to play , amongst other things in creating an awareness of the need for common action in this field .
the two resolutions that are being debated today have been drafted in response to a communication from the commission .
for the first time we have presented a communication that deals precisely with racism , xenophobia and anti-semitism .
it is a major step along the road to creating a role for the commission in the fight against racism .
our communication forms part of the union strategy against racism that the european heads of state and government called for at the corfu summit in june 1994 .
it is based on the work done by the consultative commission on racism and xenophobia , which was given its remit at the corfu meeting .
the communication is also a response to the demands put forward by parliament in many resolutions in this field .
i welcome the fact that parliament in its motion for a resolution supports the aims we have set out in the communication .
our work has been guided by three objectives :
1.we want to fight racism in a number of different policy areas .
the communication reviews all the initiatives that the commission has taken or intends to take in order to combat racism .
the principle is that the fight against racism must be waged through a whole range of policy measures .
these must together form part of our general policy objectives .
we seek measures that do not just deal with the symptoms but tackle the causes of racism.we want to promote integration , for example , and combat exclusion , especially on the labour market .
we have therefore proposed that the employment initiative be given a new dimension in the context of the european social fund .
the new initiative , ' employment integra ' , is intended to make the labour market more accessible to such groups as immigrants and ethnic minorities .
discrimination and racism make it particularly difficult for these groups to get work .
in this context , i would make special mention of the joint declaration adopted by the social partners in florence last october .
we propose , amongst other things , a major effort on education ; the community 's education programme , socrates , could be put to use here .
thank you , commissioner .
mr president , the milan european council decided that 9 may should be celebrated as europe day .
i most certainly do not blame you for this situation , mr president .
ladies and gentlemen , 9 may is the political birthday of the european union .
the date of 9 may is not just a holiday for brussels and the european institutions .
it is europe day for all the citizens of our european union , a europe day that belongs as much to the scots as it does to all other europeans .
to prohibit flying the european flag on schools and public buildings on 9 may will not influence your attitude to europe or that of others .
the european union is not impressed .
we are here today for an ordinary working meeting .
that is certainly what robert schuman , the first president of this parliament , would have wished .
the european union , europe as a whole , is facing great challenges .
in this new europe which we must shape , nothing will be as it was over the past five decades .
european unification began on the ruins of the great european disaster , which came to an end only five years before 1950 in an inferno of hatred and blood , death and destruction .
today we are looking back on a period of economic development and an era of peace in europe which has no parallel in recent history .
against the background of the history of the european nations , the process of european unification over the last 46 years has been a unique success story .
it has been the most successful peace movement in european history .
and yet there is uncertainty and scepticism among the people .
they are not against europe but very often they no longer know why they should be for it .
that is why we must make it clearer what european unification is today and also what it is not , what european unification need not be and , above all , why we still need european unification .
for robert schuman and many others 46 years ago , european unification was the only solution for securing peace and rebuilding the destroyed economy .
today some people think europe is part of the problem rather than part of its solution .
even in the new , undivided europe the same applies as before : never again must a state become so sovereign that it can decide alone on war and peace and on the weal and woe of its neighbours .
( applause ) unemployment , which is also a social crisis and can become a political crisis , can only be tackled through european cooperation .
acting together gives us more chances , and we bear a common responsibility for protecting the environment and preserving the foundations of life in our europe .
a realistic environmental policy and dreams of national sovereignty are mutually exclusive .
either we manage to tackle the problems jointly or we remain alone and sovereign and they destroy us .
the challenges of our time cannot be tackled if we keep to the old methods .
we would be poor heirs of robert schuman if we tried , in a union of 15 member states , to continue unchanged with the institutions and procedures that were suitable for the community of six 50 years ago .
the european union that wants to introduce a common currency and to enlarge towards the south and the east needs to be more steadfast than before , but also more flexible .
that is the creative effort that must be made by the intergovernmental conference on the reform of the maastricht treaty .
and here we can be guided by the far-sighted realism , the courage to accept the new and the calm resolve of robert schuman .
we must not fail either , ladies and gentlemen !
( applause )
votes
mr president , i should like to draw parliament 's attention to the fact that the adoption of amendment no 8 will cause amendment no 48 to fall .
the original author of amendment no 8 , mr liese , had expressed reservations concerning the fact that he noted , in amendment no 48 , a restriction in favour of the biosphere reserves of national and regional parks .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
mr president , the word bannissement in french comes out differently in some translations .
so we are against the word bannissement , which would represent a legal provision .
in addition we are against using names .
let us first put it to the vote leaving out the word ' bannissement ' and the names .
mr president , i should have liked to speak before you proceeded to the vote .
i believe that this vote is inadmissible because it is contrary to the general principles of the rights of the people of europe .
i find such a position to be totalitarian , contrary to the treaty and contrary to the general principles of european law .
it reveals the true nature of this report .
we have checked all that .
the text of this resolution is admissible and we have now voted .
mr president , i should like to ask you to request the staff to compare the various language versions .
i assume that the original text of the report is the dutch text .
in any case there is a clear linguistic difference between the various versions .
the french text speaks of bannissement .
the dutch text speaks of veroordeling .
the english text speaks of ostracizing .
those are different concepts .
i should like to press emphatically for us to have one unambiguous interpretation in the final text , because i think the interpretation just given by our fellow-member on the right side of the house is incorrect .
of course , mr de vries .
we will have the translated versions checked , as we have always done in such cases ; we will do so again here .
after the vote on the amendments :
mr president , this has been a complicated matter and a very sensitive one as well .
i have written ' chaos ' in the margin against one set of votes because i did not understand what was happening .
you said the text would be aligned but i am not sure with what .
we will check that too , mr kellett-bowman .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
a monopoly in itself does not give any guarantees of equal service to all citizens .
on the other hand , it makes for well designed legislation .
besides , it is important not to mix up deregulation of the market for goods and services with deregulation of the labour market .
deregulation of the market for goods and services may be good for the consumers , but at the same time it requires more protection for the employees .
retention of monopolies on the postal market poses the risk of failure to cope with the consequences of deregulation on the telecommunications market .
if the postal monopoly is not able to meet this competition , jobs may be lost among the postal workforce .
the commission 's proposal has met with opposition in a number of quarters , which is also noted in the report produced by mr simpson .
the debate has drawn in views from the major postal administrations in europe and from the trade union movement .
smaller state postal operators and private mail services have not contributed overmuch to the debate .
the discussion on competition as a means of promoting the development of this sector and bringing down prices to consumers has also remained in the background .
we think that liberalization would be good for existing postal businesses , since it would create incentives to them to improve their service and offer it at lower prices .
a multitude of new enterprises would also be created , which would provide jobs for many people .
these positive effects have been experienced in countries that have liberalized their postal markets .
in view of the above , we vote against the simpson report .
i present this brief explanation of vote on my own behalf and on behalf of my colleague mich&egrave;le lindeperg , who is representing us both at a meeting in lyons to mark europe day .
it is regrettable that parliament 's timetable prevents us from being out and about among the people on the occasion of this popular event .
there is no point in organizing major information campaigns on this subject if we , europe 's democratic representatives , are prevented from participating due to no fault but our own !
i will not repeat the analysis i made this morning on the proposal for a directive on the postal services .
it seems to me that the simpson report , in the form we have just approved , guarantees the necessary balance between the requirements of competitiveness and modernization on the one hand and the public service on the other .
over and above the present debate , it is high time we defined and laid down the notion of public service in the treaty .
through a more precise wording of article 90 ( 2 ) ?
by adopting a charter of european public services ?
by setting out the rights of public service users in a statement of the fundamental rights of citizens ?
these various proposals have all been made .
they must now be referred to the intergovernmental conference so that it can clearly define the framework for action of the public services of the future .
i believe that such universality which becomes an obligation on the public provider of postal services requires a uniform tariff structure supported by a proper reserved sector .
substantial changes are already taking place in the postal market .
the union now has fifteen member states whose postal services differ widely in their quality , performance and evolution in recent years .
new technologies are opening up new markets , alternatives to the traditional postal service , such as fax and e-mail .
premium , high-speed , high-quality services have opened up new markets at premium prices .
now even courts are opening up and legitimizing the possibility of cross-border remailing .
this climate requires an appropriate european framework to manage , rather than avoid , these developments .
i voted against the simpson report today because it is based on a strong ideological streak of protectionism as the best way to preserve the public service ethic .
in today 's world this is misplaced .
the report 's balance is too producer-driven which , apart from the issue of universality , fails to take due account of legitimate consumer interests .
it strikes the wrong balance on how open or closed the system should be .
philosophically the report seems to confuse liberalization with privatization and seems to regard any competition as being unfair competition .
my preference is for a controlled , careful and managed opening of the european postal market with universal service guarantees as a fundamental requirement and with a strong role for the european parliament as a partner in managing change .
to perpetuate victorian attitudes and systems will carry neither the producers or consumers of postal services into the next millennium .
the communications workers union of ireland is seriously concerned about the implications of the directive on the future of postal services in ireland .
i would like to take the opportunity of placing on the record a number of these concerns which they have conveyed to me .
firstly , i would like to question the use of the ' notice ' procedure .
this will allow the commission to decide unilaterally by 31 december 2000 whether direct mail should remain within the reserved area .
the notice procedure , by only taking account of competition most relevant to articles 90 and 86 , ignores regional and social issues .
it would have been more satisfactory if article 100a had been chosen as the framework for the proposed directive .
secondly , it would appear that the commission has not taken into account the damage that will be done to the viability of the postal service in ireland because of the proposals for liberalization of cross-border mail .
thirdly , i dispute the commission view that the different components of the postal business constitute separate markets .
while it is possible to regard some services as value added , such as express courier as distinct from express mail services , it is , nonetheless , wrong to allow downstream access to postal facilities .
fourthly , as the cost of rural mail in places like ireland is twice the unit cost of urban mail , there should be a large geographic cross-subsidy between urban and rural locations .
sixthly , any liberalization of direct mail would be impossible to police , open to abuse by larger mailers and it would be better if it continued to be treated as part of the general letter service .
finally , international mail should remain part of the reserved service .
ireland is particularly vulnerable to liberalization of this sector as 28 % of revenue comes from international mail - four times the european average .
i trust that before the commission makes any final decisions it will take on board the views of those who work in the postal service in ireland and who will be directly affected by policy changes in this area .
after six years of consultation , today we have finally succeeded in approving at first reading this proposal for a directive which is of major importance for europe 's public postal service operators .
i should therefore like to warmly congratulate our rapporteur , brian simpson , for his perseverance in undertaking such a thorough study .
this was necessary in order to maintain an efficient , high quality public service accessible to everybody wherever they live .
today 's vote should be seen as an expression of the desire for financial and geographical fairness and social and economic cohesion .
a certain model of society was at stake , a model based on public intervention to guarantee public service missions .
in view of the great importance of postal services to consumers , we consider the commission 's action proposals to be beneath contempt .
nor is it something the public in the eu want or demand .
it is a result of the union 's desire to force through harmonization and uniformity through legislation , instead of cooperation across frontiers .
on the other hand , we do not support the amendments under which the eu flag or the value in euro should appear on stamps .
in view of the above , we vote in favour of the simpson report , in that it represents an improvement on the commission 's proposals .
i voted in favour of the report .
the post is a social service which should be available to everyone on equal terms at the same cost throughout the land .
the main task of the post office , and hence the mail industry , is to serve the public by moving mail at the lowest possible prices and to the best possible standard of service .
the main tasks of the post office should be regulated by law .
how the postal service is organized is , in my opinion , of secondary importance .
it can be organized by way of monopolies , competition or various forms of mixed enterprise , or it can be on a contract basis .
it is a matter for each individual country .
there is no reason why the organization and forms of enterprise should be the same throughout the eu .
on the other hand , it is important that the national postal services in europe and in the world as a whole coordinate their activities in order to provide the best service .
the postal business has been deregulated in sweden .
it is important that swedish postal services can compete on equal terms with their foreign competitors in sweden and abroad .
competition with other postal enterprises , for example abroad , is important , but must be subordinated to the main task of providing good service to all citizens in the home country at acceptable prices .
deregulation , with ensuing privatization , which is implemented too rapidly can lead to reduced standards of service in sparsely populated areas and peripheral regions , which are merely ' loss-making areas ' , and to increased unemployment .
all changes must therefore take place with due regard to the social and economic consequences .
our group has expressed its firm opposition to the proposal for a directive by the commission opening up the postal services to competition .
we welcome the fact that the european parliament adopted these amendments which genuinely put the brake on the ultra-liberalization of the directive .
the council must take this into account .
it is in this spirit that together with certain members of my group i shall not be voting against the proposal but abstaining .
our final vote at second reading will be decided on the basis of what amendments the council accepts or rejects .
liberalization measures must indeed not mean the destruction of well-established services or that all citizens no longer have full equal access to postal services .
that is why it is essential to ensure equality of opportunity and the financial autonomy of small p & t operators too .
in that context it is not acceptable to endanger or even abolish the public service ( by imposing conditions and giving exclusive rights and responsibility for operating the ' reserved ' services and the universal service ) .
that does not mean that we should oppose opening up the postal service to competition to some extent .
a certain amount of competition can certainly be in the interests of the users .
absolute competition , however , could mean that only the economically profitable postal services operate to the full while the universal service - to the detriment of many users - is neglected .
so it is imperative to choose the right road here !
in luxembourg we can boast a high-quality public postal service .
it would be irresponsible if this small ( in europe-wide terms ) operator , which satisfies its small and large customers , were now destroyed by exaggerated liberalization decisions .
that is why i entirely agree with the ep rapporteur : the european postal system should only be liberalized to the extent that this benefits all consumers without jeopardizing the universal service .
nor should the adverse social effects the liberalization measures might have be forgotten at eu level , where the dialogue with the social partners has become an important component of social policy for some time now .
that is why it is appropriate to consult the european social partners with regard to the ' postal services ' sector too .
i voted for the report , and i consider that the rapporteur 's amendments improve substantially on the commission 's proposal .
i would , however , like to clarify some views .
the provision of postal services is a public service activity .
experience in other industries shows that deregulation does not yield greater efficiency but more often , instead , results in increased unemployment and increased regional disparities .
in spite of passive , or at least not active , resistance on my part , this is the stage we have reached .
brian simpson is experiencing his finest hour . the longest-running rapporteur-ship on a dossier ever seen by the european parliament is drawing to a close .
the rapporteur deserves praise , even from me .
that is also more or less the only tribute i can pay him .
because the present dossier is a blot on the escutcheon of all those who would like to call themselves with any justification representatives of the people .
the citizen has an incontestable right to post and to adequate provision of service .
it is better to forget as quickly as possible that the trade unions and the poor providers of services have succeeded in frustrating the internal market in this way .
meanwhile it will be clear that my group is not happy with the draft report now before us .
as the least bad alternative to our own amendments we shall support the ferber amendments .
if they are not accepted we shall vote against the report and ask the commission to withdraw the proposal for a directive and apply unabridged and without delay the communication from the commissioner responsible for competition policy .
oostlander report
mr president , for various reasons the eldr group has voted for the resolution and the proposal .
it is necessary for the european union to obtain clear authority to take action in this area of policy .
the establishment of an observatory for racism and xenophobia is desirable .
finally , an anti-racism year is a good thing but it cannot stop there .
the fight must be ongoing .
it is also a pity that this half hour was then used by some members to make the kind of statement we have just heard .
in my view those are two things we should not just let pass .
what is important about this report , however , is that we have managed to carry through some points which in my view are of quite considerable importance .
we must do our utmost to create greater tolerance in europe .
above all we must ensure that minorities have equal opportunities , not just so that they can integrate but also on the employment market .
we have now entered the reign of totalitarianism .
i refuse to allow this confusion and i voted against this resolution .
a simple reference to the texts just adopted by the house amply justifies my position .
or alternatively : the european parliament ' calls upon member states to include ( immigrants ) in social and political decisions , and also to grant them voting rights ' .
and elsewhere we find parliament denouncing ' statements of the council in which , contrary to scientific facts , a link was established between unemployment in the union and immigration ' .
two lessons may be drawn from this anthology , which although not exhaustive is representative of the overall tone of this text .
the second lesson is that we must warn the sincere antiracists of the serious consequences which the confusion at the heart of the oostlander report is likely to produce .
we vote for the report because we think it important to combat racism and xenophobia .
we would further point out that we do not think the eu should take over the powers the council of europe currently has in this field .
we do not believe that there is a ' european ideal ' or a ' european identity ' ; on the contrary , we believe in the diversity that creates the multicultural society .
wherever unemployment is increasing , public services are deteriorating and social exclusion is being created , we also see racism and xenophobia increasing .
we thus also see the convergence policy currently being implemented in the eu creating precisely the negative conditions that are conducive to racism and xenophobia .
the authors of this report intend to pronounce 1997 ' european year against racism ' .
such a decision cannot be enthusiastically supported by the belgian national front .
this motion for a resolution could in fact have very serious consequences for the stability and balance of our european institutions .
true democrats pride themselves upon an acceptance of dialogue with their political opponents , even if they do disagree on the immigration issue .
the ancient greeks showed us the path of tolerance .
is the european parliament ready to disregard thousands of years of democratic tradition and platonic rhetoric ?
i voted for the report .
it is important to combat racism and xenophobia in all situations .
it is a good thing , therefore , that the matter is also being discussed in the eu .
however , this must not be allowed to lead to a weakening of the broader and more focused responsibility of the council of europe .
unemployment , a bad environment for children growing up , bad living conditions and social exclusion are often the breeding ground of racism .
if these problems are alleviated , racism will also be curbed .
education , knowledge , diversity and human fellowship are important aids to curbing racism and xenophobia in sweden , the eu and the world as a whole .
we welcome this decision .
we felt that we must point out that the point of departure for the european parliament 's decision was a negative one , much more half-hearted than the commission proposal .
my delegation and i have registered with great indignation the fact that a majority , although a small one , of the european parliament has approved this report .
against racism and xenophobia ' ) .
the resolution does not just make what are virtually slanderous and libellous allegations , without a shred of evidence , it also cultivates a literary style ( ' ...
ostracize and isolate ' ...
) that harks back to precisely the totalitarian , fascist vocabulary that its supporters supposedly reject .
it is then only a small step from the early medieval punishment of ostracism to branding and from isolating to outlawing .
we believe that in so doing the majority of the european parliament has bowed submissively to a few extremists and done a poor service to the european ideal by this interference in austrian domestic policy .
i read carefully and with interest the report on which we have just voted and i approve of its main thrust .
but i should like to point out that a report on a subject of such importance , at a time of economic crisis and inward-looking tendencies , could have been the subject of a more searching study .
some subjects need time for thought .
respect for diversity has always been one of the founding values of the european union and the european parliament plays a major role in this respect .
myself , i did not vote for two elements in the report .
to state that the european union , due to the policy of its council of ministers , permitted ethnic cleansing on its borders is very regrettable .
i also find it inappropriate to cite the leaders of the two parties of the far right .
on the other hand , we must deplore the fact that our european parliament includes some equally extremist representatives , and failing to cite these members lends them an unacceptable respectability .
the discussion of this umpteenth report on socalled racism and so-called xenophobia is one of the few times in this parliament when one might wish that speaking-time were rather less restricted .
one would need at least half a day to sum up all the lies or follies of the report before us .
in reality this report , like the commission communication on which it is partly based , has nothing to do with actually combating xenophobia or racism .
the report is intended once more at all costs to cram the so-called ' multicultural society ' down the throats of the citizens of the european nations although those citizens simply do not want it .
the passage on education and youth in the explanatory statement speaks volumes in that respect .
you could fancy yourself back in the time of the educational experiments of nazi germany or of the communist tyrannies , where education is used to shape the people 's political thinking according to the one true doctrine .
i voted for the report , but do not share all the views presented .
the report contains a proposal for the setting up of a monitoring centre for racism and xenophobia in the european union , to serve a network of existing organizations answerable to the commission .
but to build up central organizations in accordance with the proposal is of doubtful value .
in most cases , this merely serves to produce more paper , without actually affecting public attitudes on the matter .
i think this question is best left to the council of europe .
as the council of europe has a much larger number of member countries in europe , i think that organization is much better suited to directing the struggle for human rights and against racism .
i think it would be a mistake to set up internal border controls to restrict the free movement of third country citizens within the european union .
here you have continually ridden roughshod over the rules .
mr cassidy has produced a very good report in many respects and presents some important points that are critical of the commission in this matter .
we can agree with mr cassidy 's word of warning that unemployment is increasing , despite the fact that the common market is almost complete .
this means that our criticism of faith in the eu as a politico-economic market is correct and that it will not bring down unemployment but , on the contrary , will lead to more unemployment .
we vote for the report as a whole , but do not support all the conclusions drawn by mr cassidy , for example the belief that traditional growth will solve all problems .
in paragraph 19 , mr cassidy urges the conclusion of an employment pact that carries real weight but , unfortunately , he does not give substance to the phrase .
we learn nothing about what an employment pact would mean in concrete terms , so we cannot take a view on the proposal .
my group would have been pleased to be able to vote for the cassidy report if amendment no 29 had not been approved .
that communist amendment supported by the socialist group , advocates the introduction of a levy on capital transactions .
that is contrary to freedom of movement of capital , one of the four pillars of the internal market .
an irresponsible decision .
my group therefore had to decide to vote against .
i think that mr cassidy 's report is good overall .
in actual fact , monetary union would mean that member states would lose the possibility of applying monetary policy altogether .
that concludes voting time .
adjournment of the session
i declare the session adjourned .
( the sitting was closed at 1.50 p.m. )
resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on 9 may 1996 .
mr president , this morning a terrorist attack was carried out in cordoba . it was the work of the eta terrorist group and resulted in the death of an army sergeant , miguel ayll&oacute;n .
mr marset campos , the house has condemned this kind of terrorist attack on several occasions .
we do so again in this case and i will express condolences and sympathy to the families on behalf of us all .
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents at its meeting of 15 may 1996 pursuant to rule 95 of the rules of procedure has been distributed .
sitting of 20-24 may in strasbourg
please note that the deadline for tabling motions for resolutions on cuba is set at 12 noon on tuesday ; the deadline for tabling amendments is 12 noon on wednesday .
pursuant to the rules of procedure , one speaker may now speak in favour and one against .
mr pasty has asked for the floor .
i assume he is speaking in favour .
why ?
mr president , i understand very clearly what mr pasty is asking for .
with what is now proposed , we have no idea when that debate is going to start .
that seems to us entirely incongruous .
do not take this amiss , mr president .
mr pasty has put forward a proposal .
it is true that the agriculture debate is very important to many members of the house , not just members of mr pasty ' group , but for members of other groups as well .
of course we have to have enough time to debate other matters , but i was rather surprised by mrs green 's remarks .
we cannot have the house 's agenda determined by whether or not officials of parliament choose to be here .
this house is sovereign .
that really is enough .
the rules of procedure are quite explicit .
i had not quite realised that mr pasty was speaking as the mover of the request but took him to be the speaker ' in favour ' .
and as the mover of the request he has the right to justify it .
then mrs green spoke against .
mr de vries spoke in favour and i think that is sufficient .
we have to vote now .
mr president , i just want clarification .
this is a crucially important debate for us .
so , if we could have that assurance , my group will vote in favour .
i am assuming that the senior officials of parliament know what plenary sittings are and that they will be present at plenary sittings for certain subjects .
surely that is only a matter of course in a working parliament ! ( parliament agreed to the request )
mr president , i just wish to make the point that some of us are here at 9 o ' clock for the night sittings and know exactly who comes to these night sittings !
it is not the case that people are usually here when important discussions are going on .
the secretary-general has indeed realised that , quite directly so to speak , for he is sitting beside me .
he will no doubt say the necessary to his colleagues .
sitting of 5-6 june 1996 in brussels
we have one more point , in relation to the sittings of 5 and 6 june in brussels .
the group of the european people 's party has requested that the council make a statement on the decision not to admit croatia to the council of europe .
that would of course be entered on the agenda of wednesday afternoon .
i call mrs oomen-ruijten to move the request .
mr president , we should very much like to have a statement from the council on its decision in the council of europe , apparently reached jointly by all the fifteen .
even though the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly gave its approval , fifteen of the members voted against and we would like to have a statement on that .
i would ask you to make time available for that , mr president .
it should be possible to have this instead of the debate on the ombudsman .
your request is that we take this during the june i part-session .
that would mean we try to include this item on the agenda of wednesday , 5 june , beginning with a council statement .
since nobody has asked to speak against , i assume the house agrees .
the order of business is thus established .
return and export of cultural goods
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
the eec treaty set up an area without borders for the single market in which the free circulation of goods was guaranteed .
however , in turn , it became clear that it was necessary to make this free circulation of goods compatible with responsibility for cultural goods which are symbols of europe 's rich and varied cultural idiosyncrasy .
to this end the eec treaty recognised that these states could impose prohibitions or restrictions on the import and export of cultural goods .
cultural goods are those goods qualifying for protection and defined as those listed in an appendix common to both the regulation and the directive offering an economic evaluation .
these categories of cultural goods include paintings - category 3 - and drawings - category 4 .
the financial threshold for paintings is 150 , 000 ecu and for drawings 15 , 000 ecu .
but this would have gone against the positions of the member states whose definition was rejected and will also not have been a viable solution in financial terms .
we know in fact that as a whole , to generalise , the price of water colours is much lower than that for paintings and much higher than that for drawings .
were the threshold the same as that for paintings a high proportion of water colours , pastels and gouache would circulate unrestricted .
were the threshold for drawings , 15 000 ecu , to apply , far too great a number of such works would require community export licences , leading to red-tape problems , economic chaos and budgetary difficulties .
in other words , the solution would be to create a category which comes between category 3 for paintings and category 4 for drawings , an intermediate new category 3a to be inserted between categories 3 and 4 .
mr president , i think that mr escudero 's report has a certain value and i ask him to accept my congratulations .
however , mr president , speaking for my group at least , i feel that i must draw attention to the fundamental underlying pretence of the directive and regulation that are being proposed .
firstly , i do not believe that creativity is strengthened by emphasizing and protecting objects rather than their creators .
you will say that this has nothing to do with the texts that we are debating , but i just wish to make the point .
many such creators of cultural objects , among those who are alive now at least , are quite emphatic about that .
secondly , mr president , i truly cannot fathom out this attempt - if my understanding of it is correct - to restrict international trade in cultural objects .
what is the meaning of it ?
in saying that such and such a cultural object must not be taken out of the country are we saying that cultural goods ought really to be available for broadly based public and social enjoyment ?
then what does it matter then if a private citizen in the territory of a country which prohibits the export of cultural objects wishes to keep such an object at home purely for his own enjoyment ?
i fear that , essentially , the directive and regulation will do nothing but bring about a lowering of the value of objects kept at home by private collectors .
but why ?
is it because we expect that as time goes by someone , the state that is , will be able to buy them and make them available for the pleasure of the general public ?
if that were the case there would be a meaning in it .
i do not think that cultural heritage problems which stem from the organization of the market and the circulation of capital can be solved like this .
mr president , the rapporteur is quite right to point out that this is primarily a technical matter .
but he is equally right to point out that in the end we are concerned with the protection of cultural goods .
but we should also follow the proposal from the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights and review the effectiveness of both the directive and the regulation after three years .
i think a separate comment has to be made on the wording with regard to the return of national cultural goods .
i think we have to discuss this right from the start in relation to the general accessibility of cultural goods , protection against misuse and forming part of a regional or local cultural context .
who is the owner of the symphony from which we have taken our european anthem ?
i think the answer to that question is also relevant to the fine arts .
mr president , i believe we can all be pleased with the two proposals submitted for our scrutiny today .
a remedy therefore had to be found for this practice , which i ' m afraid has been common in the past .
remember the way the nazis organized the pillage of works of art in the countries they occupied .
what is more , this practice has not completely disappeared .
two additional bricks have been added to the edifice by this regulation and directive , as they introduce the concept of ' national treasures ' making it possible to give them protection under community law .
a comment and a regret , however .
if it is absolutely fundamental that cultural goods should be protected , it is all the more regrettable that the raphael programme has been blocked .
so , ladies and gentlemen , the tree formed by these two measures is an undoubted improvement , but this should not make us lose sight of the wood of our shortcomings in protecting our heritage .
speaking from that standpoint , i would like to urge the commission just a little bit more to venture at some juncture to put its fingers on the stigmata .
is the priceless cultural heritage , passed down from the depths of history , which has been stolen from countries such as mine for instance , going to be protected ?
are those countries which are currently in possession of priceless archaeological treasures going to be made to return those cultural objects to the countries from which they were stolen ?
even parts of the parthenon , that immense creation of the human mind , are being kept far away from their rightful place , and their return is being refused !
in the impending substantial revision of the directive can we not insert a demand , at long last , for the return of such treasures to the countries they belong to ?
that is my question to the commission , mr president , and i would like a reply .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , for once this report describes to us a legal mechanism that is perfectly in balance .
this is the mechanism of articles 30 and 34 , laying down the principle of free trade , and of article 36 , laying down the conditions for the protection of national heritages of cultural goods .
why this article 36 ?
in the end it exists , firstly , to prevent an attack on cultural diversity and , secondly , to avoid dispossessing the poorest of their cultural identity .
at this point , i can not help thinking of a famous saying of the french socialist jean jaur&egrave;s : ' the poor have only their country ' .
for with very little in the way of personal goods , they , more than other citizens , have only their national cultural heritage to enjoy .
mr president , of course it is extremely important for those cultural goods that form or will one day form the artistic heritage of the member states to remain in their original environment .
the fact that there are divergent artistic views on many subjects , e.g. , the definition of the various types of pictures , is proof of the member states ' cultural independence .
this fact alone suggests that it should be up to the national states to fix the financial threshold for certain categories of art works .
it should be left to the national states to decide what priorities they set and what financial thresholds they observe in order to counter the risk of an artistic sell-out .
at any rate , the commission undertakes to submit the triennial report within the requisite time-limit , that is to say during the course of the year , for more detailed consideration .
we should be very grateful to individual members of the house if they would also exert pressure on their member states to expedite submission of the annual report to the commission .
thank you , mrs bonino .
the debate is closed .
the vote will be take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
the second amendment refers to a more controversial matter to which the european parliament is particularly sensitive : the type of committee through which the council 's participation will take place and the decisions on humanitarian aid .
finally , the third amendment refers to commission relations with humanitarian agencies and responds to a compromise reached with non-governmental organisations .
finally , we think that making it necessary to discuss problems with humanitarian agencies and keep them informed can only benefit transparency and co-ordination , key words in the commission proposal .
as i said , the final outcome is a good regulation on humanitarian aid , which is why i am asking for a vote in favour of the recommendation by the committee on development .
let us hope , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , that we can be able to prevent conflicts so that humanitarian aid of this kind will no longer be necessary .
this work is a credit to the european union , which , alone in the world , i repeat , is endowed with such determination and such instruments .
we should like these proposals to be extended to humanitarian mine-clearing operations and we are not happy with the results of the vienna conference in this respect .
in order to carry out all these actions , coordination with ngos and international organizations had to be improved .
that is now done , and parliament will receive an annual report on such aid .
we willingly accept that the commission and echo can alone decide emergency measures not exceeding a budget of ecu 10 million .
on the other hand , we shall be much firmer and more watchful over the comitology procedure - i can not get used to this name - adopted by the council .
the procedure 3a suggested seems to us quite obviously cumbersome , expensive and sometimes difficult to implement .
i cannot say this too strongly : watch out for emergencies , watch out for delays , we would not be forgiven for them .
in liberia , do you see states discussing whether a boat should be sent when people are drowning ?
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , first i too would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on behalf of our group .
we are concerned here with humanitarian aid , that is to say , the suffering of many millions of people in the world .
we all know that the money from this budget line cannot in itself reduce all the suffering in the world let alone eliminate it completely .
a final decision must be taken on this at the 1996 intergovernmental conference , and on the abolition of the unanimity rule .
on the other hand , of course we must also ensure through long-term projects that the situation in many countries stabilizes and that these humanitarian disasters do not therefore occur in the first place .
natural disasters will continue to exist , but here too i do not believe that they are acts of god .
that is why the european union must carry out a much wider-scale preventive environmental policy than before in order to prevent such disasters in future .
on the other hand , it means that this money must be allocated especially effectively , because we are dealing here with human lives .
every deutschmark that is wasted cannot be used to save human lives .
moreover , we face the dilemma that we have to act as quickly as possible and that certain control measures , which are necessary or are carried out in other areas , cannot be implemented in this area .
we discussed that at great length in committee and also followed the council 's discussions of this subject .
we really must reconcile these two interests .
the rapporteur herself mentioned that this committee procedure is regarded with some criticism , presumably partly because the european parliament does not have any chance of participation here .
of course the best solution would be for us to be just as involved in all the political decisions of the commission as the council representatives are , but i do not think that is feasible at this moment .
the alternative , namely to let the commission decide quite freely here , without being tied by any political instructions , has its dangers too .
speaking just for myself i must say that some comments made by the responsible commission officials - i do not mean you , madam commissioner - did rather irritate me .
for instance , i did not always receive a confidence-inspiring answer to the question of how to ensure that the money is allocated effectively .
the un 's basic expertise lies in crisis management rather than crisis prevention .
but the un does not currently have the human and material resources it needs to put into effect a warning system that is both credible and independent .
its excessively centralized administration does not lend itself to implementing rapid preventive measures .
mr president , i will begin where the rapporteur , mrs sauquillo , left off , and i must compliment her on her work .
indeed , humanitarian aid workers would not be necessary if it were possible to bring preventive action to a satisfactory conclusion .
i would thus argue in favour of more material support , including private initiatives from this house , given that mrs sauquillo is a member of the forum for preventive diplomacy .
the european union is extremely active in providing humanitarian aid to crisis areas , and that can only be good .
former yugoslavia , angola , the great lakes region of africa , we are there .
i am very proud of that and so are all the members of my group and perhaps all dutchmen too .
we are in favour of moves to give this policy a legal basis at last .
the union needs flexible rules for decision-making in this area .
for this reason too the liberals support the rapporteur 's amendments .
that penalizes the needy population , but it offends my own conscience too . the objective is to get as much help as possible to the population and not to comply with a few rules .
since 1992 we have had the european union 's humanitarian aid office - echo .
mrs sauquillo has submitted an important report that sets out specific objectives and general criteria for the community 's humanitarian aid .
we have noted that difficulties arose with other commission departments and that problems have occurred in the cooperation between echo and the other commission services responsible for development policy .
we were told that they have been or will be dealt with .
however , to date we have not seen a specific document defining the areas of competence .
i believe we must differentiate between emergency aid , aid for reconstruction , i.e. , rehabilitation , and development aid - that is not in the report .
only on the basis of a common programme can we achieve anything in the field of humanitarian aid .
it was also said here that this is an area of foreign policy .
finally , in my view we need a little more modesty and a little more cooperation with the ngos .
the ngos in particular have often criticized echo for taking a centralist approach .
here we must encourage dialogue , here we are a critical partner ; then we will be able to provide humanitarian aid in real emergency situations .
mr president , the commissioner has heard from the rapporteur , the chairman of the committee and representatives of all the groups that he has compromised too far on the comitology issue .
the council 's adherence to setting up new , delaying and secretive comitology committees prejudices this whole regulation .
it is a regulation about humanitarian aid , which , in particular , should be about bringing speedy relief to the innocent victims of disaster and conflict throughout the world .
nevertheless , in supporting amendment no 2 today this parliament remains steadfast in its opposition to any extension of these excessive 3a committees .
the delay in translating those papers into eleven different languages can be measured in terms of extra deaths .
it seems to us that the council is more interested in playing the politics of europe than in assisting people in distress .
we ask the commissioner to support parliament in our resolve on this issue .
mr president , i also would like to add my congratulations to mrs sauquillo p&eacute;rez del arco for an excellent report .
but , as mr howitt has said , this regulation represents yet again the wish of member states to usurp the executive responsibilities of the commission .
the comitology procedures which are proposed are restrictive and challenge the democratic role of this parliament to which the commission should be accountable .
the 3a committee procedure proposed is certainly not an example of either openness or democracy .
the proceedings take place in secret and the members are nominated by governments .
it is indeed regrettable that the nine most significant european parliament amendments were not incorporated into the council 's common position .
parliament should not be fobbed off by the commission 's willingness to submit an annual report .
the suggested procedures for echo are extraordinarily complicated and will deter the speedy and effective action that echo so often needs to take .
there will be elaborate procedures and delays .
echo is already under enormous strain - up to 15 , 000 contracts in 1995 alone .
it is inevitable that the policies , strategies and coordination of echo will be damaged by these proposals .
more paperwork will mean more bureaucratic delay and will certainly reduce the likelihood that our programmes will be properly prepared or properly targeted .
i hope that , following tomorrow 's vote , the ' development ' council , which meets on 28 may , will be able finally to close this dossier .
the rapporteur has said how long and - let me assure you - extremely difficult the negotiations have been .
basically , there are three points that i wish to make .
the commission wishes at any rate to assure the house that we truly share that approach .
turning to the three remaining amendments , i wish to make the following points .
as regards the first , concerning exemption from tax , levies and customs duties etc , the commission will be incorporating it into its proposal because , frankly , it seems to us absolutely right .
i have therefore to say here that , as regards the 3a procedure , this concerns genuinely special cases : in particular it concerns cases involving the protection of victims or direct action by the european community .
i have also to say that , when it comes to emergency cases , the commission is empowered to take its own decisions .
admittedly , we too would have preferred a different position , but it seems to us that , at this point , we ought to accept this type of compromise on the common position .
frankly , however , it seems to me to be difficult to insert the proposal in question into a council regulation .
the commission is proposing to you a declaration in which it undertakes to cooperate and consult with the non-governmental organizations .
it does not accept the amendment simply because it does not believe that the proposal fits into the council regulation .
the commission - let me repeat this - intends , through its declaration , to enter into a very specific political commitment vis-&agrave;-vis the house and our partners who are in fact the nongovernmental organizations .
i therefore urge the house to bear in mind that humanitarian aid is geographically channelled to where it is needed and not , in fact , limited to the developing countries .
in conclusion , i would again thank the house and the rapporteur , and i hope that , once the legal basis is established , our work will be able not only to continue but to improve .
thank you , mrs bonino .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
food-aid policy and management
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this report concerns the european union 's food aid policy and creates a new legal basis for that policy .
before discussing the report in more detail , i would like to add a few words on food aid policies , for they mean more than what we are defining and deciding here through the various budget lines .
what is the situation at present on the world market ?
there are more than 800 million chronically undernourished people .
the number of children who die every day is equal to the population of a medium-sized town in our community .
this number will rise dramatically .
it will rise dramatically and new famines will occur , caused by factors we do not generally tackle .
what are the causes ?
they are natural disasters , whose origins we often do not question , such as whirlwinds .
reference was made to climatic disasters in relation to the previous report .
that means that the policy pursued in this area ought to begin with the reorganization of industrial society .
we are seeing a growing number of wars .
over recent years we have always had more than 50 wars on this planet , with many people in the european union becoming very rich from arms exports .
i think we should stop these arms exports and the production of weapons .
it would be more sensible to safeguard jobs by reorganizing the arms sector and in any case we should ensure that arms exports are registered .
then there is indebtedness , debts from which our banks make good profits and that prevent the southern countries from being able to develop and therefore condemn them to famine and disasters .
we have the gatt negotiations , a ruthless bunch of people operating on a world scale ; because of the world-scale deregulation we have an increasing number of regions that simply cannot produce enough food for themselves .
that is our point of departure .
we have devised a programme of food aid policy here that is sensible enough in itself but that cannot really take effect unless we also adapt the other policy areas .
i think that must be said from the outset if we really want to clarify the scale of the problem facing us .
this new regulation is useful , this new regulation sets targets and encourages self-sufficiency .
that is a step in the right direction for the countries concerned .
the special feature - and this is something development politicians have been demanding for years - is that with this regulation we are dissociating food exports from the promotion of food production and distribution in the developing countries concerned .
i think this dissociation from the eu agricultural market represents major progress and is most important .
a further sign of progress is that we have incorporated in the regulation something development politicians have been demanding for decades , namely the support and encouragement for triangular operations .
it makes sense to rebuild this subsistence economy at local level and through regional markets , to ensure that one country can supply food to a neighbouring country suffering from famine .
precedence is being given to extensive farming .
what we need is a reform of the un world food programme .
it must go hand in hand with this programme which we are proposing as a legislative basis .
we have incorporated consultation and control mechanisms in the internal implementing regulation , which preclude any conflicting agricultural or development aid policy .
we were very concerned with the regional dimension , as we were to emphasize the role of women in production .
in many forms of society women play an important role in the field of agriculture , nutrition and food , and that needs to be supported through joint programmes .
as with the previous report , it is a pity that this parliament does not have adequate powers .
i think that for the future formulation of this policy we need a co-decision procedure .
that is a matter for the intergovernmental conference .
the council should get that into its head , but the citizens of our member states and the members of our national parliaments should also take it in .
they must try to convince their governments , to ensure that we can achieve genuinely democratic structures here .
i think we will be faced with major famines again , and for the reasons i cited earlier .
one first indication is the price of wheat .
new markets are emerging , china is buying up wheat , the price of wheat has doubled and supplies have therefore become scarce .
this is a challenge to us right now .
we can only change this situation if we change the international structures .
we can only have a genuine food aid policy if , among others , we reorganize agricultural production in our european union .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , how could one fail to agree with mr telk&auml;mper ?
you know the old refrain : the northern countries have for thirty years been living through a recurrent crisis of agricultural overproduction , but the world still has 800 million starving people .
how could one fail to agree with him ?
the main problem as regards starvation and malnutrition is certainly not the general problem of world production , but instead that of distributing food and sharing it among the inhabitants of the world .
what is there to add to that ?
mr telk&auml;mper has mentioned some very specific points about these recommendations and i am of course in agreement with him .
this point can never be sufficiently stressed . europe has tried successfully to make the promotion of human rights the cornerstone of its development policy .
might we do the same as regards the fight against famine and poverty by accepting that democracy will not be possible if there is not enough food ?
and i would personally see no objection , either , to the possibility of transferring the debt of poor countries to development schemes and the fight against famine and malnutrition , managed by countries to which they are indebted .
mr president , first of all i should like as usual to congratulate mr telk&auml;mper .
on development issues he is one of the safest pairs of hands as far as i can see .
i entirely agree with his analysis of the situation .
the fundamental rationale of all eu food aid policy must obviously be to guarantee that the food in question gets to the communities and regions where it is most needed .
however , while short-term food aid is vital to respond to emergencies and rapidly deteriorating situations , eu food aid policy must work towards long-term security in food supply for the countries in question .
the formulation of a long-term objective of food security must be strategically based , with specific targeting of aid .
this would involve a more regional approach to food aid , helping specific regions to build up their food-producing infrastructure .
support must be given to the small farmers and food producers in the regions in question .
part and parcel of such an approach will be the further development of sectoral policies including those for agriculture , the environment , health , family planning and education .
macro-economic policy such as structural adjustment programmes should be brought into line with the requirements of guaranteeing long-term food security for all .
securing guarantees of food supply will help to combat the corrosive poverty which exists in these countries and serve as a basis for long-term development and restructuring .
in essence we need an integrated approach , not a piecemeal one ; an approach that binds together and builds up existing programmes and policy initiatives in order to create a more effective whole .
if we are to seriously pursue our long-term aim of food security then clearly we need resources to match our aspirations .
let me say that the criticism that appears to be directed at mr telk&auml;mper is totally unjustified .
i support him entirely in his approach and i thank him for it .
mr president , in opening i wish briefly to refer to my speech earlier and to highlight the fact that this regulation on food aid requires the setting-up of a new comitology , committee 2 .
we cannot let this decision pass by without raising the same objection that we expressed earlier .
but let me be positive in supporting this report too , and in particular in supporting amendments nos 5 , 6 and 21 which have been accepted in full or in part in the common position .
these amendments provide welcome recognition that women play a vital role in producing food as well as providing it for their dependants .
often in crisis situations it is women who become the sole providers and they therefore deserve particular recognition and support for this role within our development programmes .
even before the crisis begins , women and other groups experience the different food entitlements which are common in many societies .
social position affects how quickly women suffer from malnutrition and from starvation . this is also true , of course , for other groups like the elderly , the disabled and children .
reproductive health and family planning are also an integral part of our approach in this field .
they are crucial if food security is to become a reality .
growing population in turn places an increasing burden on food supplies which , if crops fail , leads to crisis and starvation .
malnutrition in pregnancy causes high mortality rates and , by increasing the chances of vitamin deficiency , leads to disabilities .
all of these factors must be taken into account if we are to realize a true policy for food aid and sustainability through the passing of this regulation .
it seems to me that this dossier tackles an issue of great importance and , as the rapporteur himself indicated , it is an area which has , of late , seen major changes .
first of all , i would stress that food aid is a fundamental factor in long-term food security policy .
moreover , we need to increase our contribution by doing all we can to encourage endogenous development : i believe this to be another factor that gives rise to a very important line of action .
that is the current position and , that being so , the commission is able to accept the bulk of the amendments tabled by the house .
the commission accepts them in substance but would like to see them worded differently .
we now come most particularly to amendment no 25 - which seems to me to be the crucial point - concerning triangular purchases .
moving on to amendment no 33 , which basically concerns the common position , the commission currently believes that it has to abide by the common position which also represents the outcome of very difficult negotiations with the council .
thank you , mrs bonino . the debate is closed .
rehabilitation programmes for developing countries
together , the european union and the member states constitute the prime source of official development aid , more than the united states and japan put together .
mr president , rehabilitation is now , or should be , in my opinion , a major link in the development process .
war , civil unrest or natural disasters are affecting an increasing number of developing countries .
the european parliament , as well as the acp-eu joint assembly strongly supported the idea of a special economic rehabilitation and social reconstruction programme .
such a programme was considered necessary mainly because the community lacked a specific instrument which would deal with situations between purely humanitarian actions and medium to long-term aid .
that is the objective of the present proposal .
these concepts must allow flexibility - and that seems to be an ' in ' word here tonight , flexibility in development - and quick action without sacrificing the necessary coherence between the actions undertaken .
rehabilitation should enable the disaster-stricken population and conflictafflicted areas to contribute to reconstruction of the economy and the improvement of their living conditions .
basically , we need to create a framework of conditions to improve the production and services sector - the vital infrastructure - and the social , institutional and administrative conditions as quickly as possible .
the earlier we act , the sooner the population will be in a position to help themselves and , what is equally important , the conditions for medium and long-term development efforts enhanced .
as long as humanitarian aid workers ' lives and the results of the planned action are not at stake , rehabilitation measures should begin as early as possible .
this is important not only for the people directly concerned but also to prevent possible further spreading of conflicts that might otherwise continue merely because of the miserable living conditions .
lastly , i wish to suggest to the commissioner that the ' can do ' approach of echo should be adopted in this particular process .
i commend this report to the house .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the commissioner has given us a most able account of her difficulties with the council and i fully understand her .
we have the same problems , often even greater ones , and we just have to make the best of it .
but i note the great dedication of the few contributors - although the best - to this debate , which concerns most of the world and the poorest parts of it .
we are all convinced that it is the european union which directs the greatest residual attention to emergency humanitarian aid , to rehabilitation and to sure supplies of food .
these figures are extraordinary .
just now , we talked about the quantity of aid .
well , let me tell you that we , the european union , give ecu 500 000 per day to the great lakes region in africa .
we obviously find money for the great lakes region : goma , burundi , rwanda , but after the event ; we also find money for rehabilitation .
but for prevention there is never any money , never any attention , never any policy decisions .
at this very moment , burundi is going downhill but we are doing nothing , and one day , when the pictures and the tragedies reach us , we shall give yet another ecu 500 000 .
in the committee on development , we have talked a great deal about these three subjects , which are to the credit of our parliament , and which , i repeat , make me worry about what will happen .
when we were the european community , one of the great policies was that of development .
today , less attention and less money is devoted to this .
i am extremely concerned when i see that the european development fund is not included in the budget , and that less attention is given to such work .
we must not however forget , in spite of our difficulties , that we are still the wealthiest part of the world .
mr president , it is a sad fact that whatever continent one looks at there seems to be civil war and genocide with its appalling consequences .
half the world seems intent on destroying itself while the other half bears the costs of trying to bring about reconciliation and reconstruction .
the reality is that we spend billions of ecu each year just keeping people alive .
help has to be given to rebuild not just their physical requirements but also their institutional organizations to give them the ability to run their countries .
that is why i welcome this council regulation on rehabilitation and reconstruction and i congratulate mrs baldi and mr andrews on the work they have done in the committee on development and cooperation .
the scale of the task is enormous and must be tackled step by step , namely food security , shelter , structural institutions and employment .
i must pay tribute to the ngos on the ground without whose dedication very little would be accomplished .
the ngos ' workers often live in appalling conditions in fear of their lives , and yet by their work in the medical and social fields they are responsible for saving millions of lives .
any programme of reconstruction needs close cooperation between donor and recipient states .
while it is natural that tenders and the awarding of contracts should be open to member states and recipient countries , regional cooperation between developing nations is also vital .
if neighbouring countries can provide services or supplies this should be encouraged as it would bring further stability to the regions .
all this work will need careful planning and adoption followed by constant monitoring and naturally the committee on development and cooperation feels its members should be closely involved .
it is also important that , where possible , local partners should invest a financial contribution so that there is sustainability for the project after community funding has ceased .
if a project cannot be sustained without continual funding it should only be supported if it has humanitarian benefits such as food security .
this whole programme must be treated as a matter of utmost importance and urgency for the restoration of basic social facilities for millions of people in dozens of countries .
we trust and hope that action will be taken soon .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , bernard kouchner is of course right to say that cooperation with developing countries has long since passed its peak .
that is the general trend : less money , less concern .
the upshot of that is that these countries seek to gain the best foothold they can in world markets .
that is the new solution . and of course we are seeing the results of that .
last year africa attracted 1.5 % of world investment .
mr president , i wish first of all to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work .
i should nevertheless like to stress two points which could , i believe , hinder the progress of this programme .
the first relates to the cumbersome nature of the structures set up to assist the commission .
in my view , this problem also goes well beyond the single case of the text submitted to us .
the second point concerns the implementation of these programmes .
the european union should take the greatest care to monitor everyone involved in implementation .
ngos , enterprises and associations should , above all , be chosen from within the developing countries concerned and within countries of the european union .
too often , unfortunately , we find that community funds are being used by organizations which are in reality only facades for large american firms .
commissioner , on this regulation , in introducing new comitology we remain furthest apart .
council in this instance requires a 3a committee for all actions above ecu 2m , whereas you join with us in seeking a 1a advisory committee for all actions .
i have to put to you : do you have the courage to act on your convictions and on this parliament 's beliefs ?
i would ask you to respond specifically to that point in reply to our debate .
i am concerned that the common position says it has accepted amendment no 5 , but that once again disabled people have dropped out of the text .
in the development situation , as elsewhere throughout this world , the main problem for disabled people is in the attitudes and lack of awareness of other able-bodied people rather than any aspect of their physical and psychological impairment .
disability is currently an invisible issue in too many of our development programmes and making disabled people visible will require positive action , risk and experiment .
in developing countries people experience disabilities caused , for example , by landmines ; for every child killed by a landmine three more are permanently injured .
other disabilities arise out of malnutrition , for example blindness , and vitamin deficiency .
these disabled adults and children share the same need for employment and housing and in other areas of their lives which we seek to ensure through the rehabilitation process .
disabled people can then be enabled to become contributors to their communities rather than being forced into dependence .
we ask you to look again at the wording of amendment no 5 and we ask you to reply on the issue of comitology .
mr president , in the course of this decade we have seen a shift in the emphasis as far as global development priorities are concerned .
increasingly , we have funded military action as tension and conflict get out of control .
in the absence of timely political action , humanitarian aid then steps in to pick up the pieces .
but long-term investment in properly targeted development assistance seems not to enjoy that same priority .
we do not seem to be putting in first place the importance of targeting proper poverty-alleviation programmes .
i know that the commissioner would agree that humanitarian aid should not at any time be seen as a substitute for political action .
of course i support the principle behind the initiative we are discussing this evening .
financing operations to progressively take over from humanitarian action and paving the way for long-term development planning is very welcome .
the regulation shows , in fact , that the commission recognizes that there is a necessity for better coordination between available instruments and that the elaboration of a more holistic approach to development is also very welcome .
however , as mr howitt has said , we have to criticize the arrangements council is proposing for the implementation .
for grants of more than ecu 2m a type 3a committee is to be used .
the council should not be mistaken .
standardization is by no means synonymous with simplification .
this is certainly the case here where the most restrictive comitology possible is set in place and it will certainly prevent the commission from acting swiftly and effectively .
many of us will remember all too well the failure of the special initiative for african recovery .
it is quite clear that comitology played its part in what turned out to be a totally ineffective operation .
i shall not therefore spend time on those which we are accepting , given that , clearly , it seems to me to be of greater interest to seek to discuss those which raise a series of problems .
i wish , however , to spend a little time on some amendments which are more difficult as far as we are concerned , in particular those on southern africa .
it seems to us that all of those amendments already form part of the common position .
the commission agrees with you that international attention to this problem is daily waning , with all the political consequences that entails .
i wish to thank the commissioner , but there is one point that i should like us to look at again together .
that is why we wish to retain a particular interest in that region - because it is genuinely of great importance to us .
the commission agrees with you , mrs baldi , about the very special importance of that region .
our only reason here is to ensure the instrument we are discussing is consistent - the instrument itself and its content .
there is no political distinction between your concern and interest and ours - it is simply a matter of a lack of consistency in the instrument under discussion .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday , 24 may 1996 .
mr president , i should like to refer to the rules of procedure , more particularly rule 5 .
a greek or a finnish member , for example , automatically receives a huge travel bonus , business class , the minute he or she attends meetings in brussels or strasbourg .
our fellow-members mrs aelvoet and mr lannoye have also made statements to the same effect , which have received extensive coverage in the belgian press .
rule 5 of the rules of procedure provides that the bureau is to lay down rules governing the payment of expenses and allowances to members .
they are reimbursed on the basis of an air ticket or a first-class rail ticket upon presentation of the relevant ticket to the members ' allowances branch .
car journeys are reimbursed on the basis of the first class rail fare .
i ask you , mr president , whether or not the provisions of rule 4 of these rules on members ' expenses and allowances are being applied .
i am of course informed of remarks and public statements by our colleagues on the practice of members with regard to the payment of expenses and allowances .
i can tell you here and now that rules 4 and 5 of the rules of procedure will be applied , and applied to the letter .
moreover , the bureau recently decided that travel expenses would only be paid to members who actually attended sittings and only if they personally signed a declaration stating that the journey had actually been undertaken .
the bureau is prepared to examine proposals for further tightening of the controls .
i believe that sweeping allegations , which bring not only individual members but our whole parliament into public disrepute , are most unhelpful .
on a personal matter mr president .
my name has been mentioned here and i wish to make a reply .
mr president , am i regarded as doing different work from my neighbour , mr giansily ?
am i regarded as doing different work from my 625 other fellow-members here ?
but you are not bold enough for that .
proposals have already been made three times both by the committee on the rules of procedure and by others in this house and the bureau has never assumed its responsibility .
you will have to apply article 6 of the treaty .
mr wijsenbeek , allow me to advise you and all other members that the bureau took the decision i have outlined on the basis of the political responsibility it bears .
should you disagree with it , every group and every member is free to make appropriate proposals to the bureau , and i guarantee that we shall discuss them .
approval of the minutes
the minutes of the last sitting have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
mr president , my name has not been included in the attendance register in the minutes , but i was present .
you can check that by looking at the results of the roll .
i ask that the register be amended accordingly .
we shall correct that , mr malangr&eacute; .
( parliament approved the minutes )
mr president , i ask to speak under rule 108 of our rules of procedure , which states very clearly that members have the right to ask to make a personal statement .
that is normally allowed once the item under discussion on the agenda has been dealt with .
the item under discussion on the agenda was the speech by mr martens , who referred to a belga report but also mentioned statements .
i have the right under rule 108 of the rules of procedure speak in order to refute any remarks made about my person .
the statement i made and paul lannoye 's too were correct as regards the system applying today .
we have simply proposed another system .
i do not think it is right for mr martens to associate our names with statements by the belga press agency , which were partially incorrect .
welcome
we bid you and your delegation a warm welcome .
urgent political matters
the next item is the statement by the commission on urgent political matters of major importance .
before calling mr santer , i should like to remind you of the rules .
the rules are that after the commission statement questions may be asked .
each questioner is allowed one minute , and in view of the large number of questions to be asked i shall ensure that this one minute is not exceeded .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am here today to talk to you about a subject of the utmost importance to our union - the campaign against unemployment .
as you know , the council of ministers of agriculture was unable , last monday , to rule on the commission 's proposal that the embargo on british exports of gelatin , tallow and semen should be lifted .
the reason was that the council was unable to achieve either the qualified majority needed to approve the decision or the simple majority needed to reject it .
this is what the commission did this morning , adhering to the consistent line it has followed since the start of this crisis .
it follows that the commission cannot take a formal decision until immediately after that , in other words on 10 june .
as for the implementation of the decision , i would remind you that a number of very strict conditions have to be satisfied in order to ensure the protection of health .
those conditions relate to the methods of production , monitoring and control , and the identification of undertakings authorized to export .
as soon as the british authorities have made the necessary arrangements and the commission has been able to verify that those arrangements are effective , the partial raising of the embargo will become a fact .
the commission , then , has complied with its responsibilities .
it will continue to do so , with the aim of arriving as soon as possible at normalization of trade with the united kingdom in the beef and veal sector .
that is the message i delivered yesterday when i met with the british foreign secretary and minister of agriculture , mr rifkind and mr hogg .
but , talking about normalization , we cannot ignore the extremely serious situation that currently exists at the council because of the blatant and deliberate policy of obstruction being pursued by the united kingdom .
the commission debated this matter in depth this morning .
it expresses its grave concern regarding the obstacles thus created to the proper functioning of our institutions .
such attitudes have no place in a union based on law and solidarity - which , by definition , is reciprocal .
such attitudes are contrary to both the spirit and the letter of the treaty . with your permission , ladies and gentlemen , i shall quote from article 5 of the treaty , which reads as follows :
' member states shall take all appropriate measures , whether general or particular , to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of this treaty or resulting from action taken by institutions of the community .
they shall facilitate the achievement of the community 's tasks .
this morning , the commission held a discussion in depth of its ideas on employment .
what is our approach ?
first , the union really must make employment a matter of common interest .
so we must take action . but what action ?
let us take this fact as a starting point : the strategy set out in the white paper on growth , competitiveness and employment in 1993 is a good strategy , but its implementation needs to be improved .
it has to move into a higher gear .
growth is essential in order to create jobs . but that does not mean growth at any price .
it must be sustainable and based on monetary stability and a sound financial policy . in this sense , the single currency is the ally of future generations .
efforts at budgetary consolidation must be stepped up , and stepped up in a manner favourable to employment . those efforts , of course , are a matter for national jurisdiction .
but it is necessary for the member states to update their programmes and to do more to emphasize consistency between the various national measures in favour of convergence and the promotion of employment .
it is also necessary for that consistency to be evaluated at union level , and for the council to be able to issue more specific recommendations within the context of the broad guidelines of economic policy .
the lines of action i have listed are also designed to strengthen our competitiveness .
we have another trump card as far as competitiveness is concerned - our internal market .
we must fully exploit its potential - all its potential .
for the sake of clarity , a number of things need to be done before the end of 1996 .
but adopting directives will not be enough . those directives also need to be transposed into national law , and applied as such .
the administrative and regulatory constraints which exist in europe are giving rise to costs in excess of ecu 100 thousand million per year , to the particular detriment of small- and medium-sized enterprises .
we have launched an initiative designed to simplify the legislation . we are going to extent it .
how many times have the heads of state and government sung the praises of the transeuropean networks ?
what i want is to see these fine words converted into action and , once and for all , a decision taken on the proposals for supplementary financing made by the commission .
as i have said , we need to do more to help our enterprises , and especially the small- and medium-sized enterprises .
the adoption of the new action programme for small- and medium-sized enterprises before the end of this year would show that our governments are seriously pursuing that objective .
furthermore , the level of state aid is amounting to several tens of thousands of millions of ecus per year within the union .
we need to reconsider how this aid can best contribute to the creation of lasting jobs , while still safeguarding fair competition .
and we also need to ensure that our competitive enterprises have fair access to the export markets . trade has to be made a tool for the benefit of employment .
i have given you , then , a broad outline of the action to be taken for the benefit of employment in the macroeconomic framework and the context of the internal market .
i now come to the third aspect of the commission 's communication , which is certainly the most delicate and difficult : the reform of the employment systems in each member state .
obviously , and i emphasize it again , the essential burden of this task rests upon governments , national administrations and the social partners .
in order to active the national employment policies , we recommend that the administrative systems for employment should be reformed , for example by simplifying aid to recruitment or to the creation of microenterprises .
we recommend that the local actors should be mobilized , for example by the decentralization of employment systems and the promotion of local development and employment initiatives .
we recommend joint initiatives by the social partners on the integration of young people , and that programmes like leonardo and youth start should be seen as an inspiration for the development of new initiatives .
finally , we recommend the development of common guidelines on the future of social protection by way of the harmonization of direct taxation and of the replacement revenues .
as regards the major projects for the future , the pact explores new approaches to the organization of labour and of education / training as levers to create access to employment .
let me give you a few key phrases in this context . a conventional european framework for the organization and flexibility of labour : the social partners must commit themselves to this .
the consequences for labour of the information society : this needs to be dealt with .
education and training : a number of schemes need to be undertaken in connection with access and validation of skills . we are particularly strong supporters of the creation of a european apprenticeship and an erasmus apprenticeship programme .
the commission will be drawing up the new objective 2 programmes on this basis .
early in 1997 , the commission will decide upon the revision of the programme , taking account of that impact .
it is also necessary to emphasize the anticipation of industrial change and changes in employment by making it a priority to support the most seriously affected sections of society , and innovative schemes .
finally , in this context , we need to encourage local development and employment initiatives .
the commission will take particular responsibility for these priorities and for cooperation with the european investment bank in the new or revised programmes .
the full efficiency of the reforms of the employment system , like the efficiency of innovative steps by businesses , depends on the mobilization of the public and private actors on the appropriate territorial scale .
we do not want to create new structures .
but we do need to launch and develop a political dynamic at local level , based on realistic economic and job-creation objectives .
the european council in florence should give the political starting signal for a selection process to find pilot regions and cities willing to commit themselves to a local pact on employment .
you now know the rules , of course .
questions will be taken on the basis of requests to speak that are made in the course of question time and not on the basis of a list of speakers .
i now open question time with the president of the commission .
president santer , i very much welcome your statement today and your continuing efforts to promote the idea of added value at community level in the field of employment .
i hope you fare well in rome at the forthcoming tripartite conference .
i want to make three brief points on what you have said : firstly , some of us in this house are a little concerned about the commission 's recommendation on the broad economic guidelines .
we feel there is a little complacency and a lack of balance .
finally , you mentioned the essen follow-up process .
one of the important elements coming out of madrid was the idea of common uniform employment indicators .
could you tell us please what progress you are making vis-&agrave;-vis member states .
that is a very important democratizing element to the essen follow-up process .
on the other hand , of course , it is necessary for the actions we are proposing today to be translated into specific agreements , especially as regards the employability of the young .
it is necessary , then , for very specific commitments to be entered into by all those concerned , not only at government level but also at the level of the social partners .
furthermore , we are conducting a dialogue with the social partners on a number of these matters .
progress has been achieved in this respect , but to make that kind of progress on all the points arising out of essen is not enough .
it is statistical progress , but it needs to be given more substance if we are to make real progress along the road to the reduction of unemployment .
mr president , i should like to ask commission president santer what message your communication sends to young unemployed people .
i am quite well aware that employment can be created artificially but new jobs cannot be talked into existence .
i should therefore like to see more measures to ensure the necessary structural changes , more deregulation , liberalisation and the abolition of old national monopolies in europe .
mr president , in our communication we provided for a number of schemes relating to the employability of young people , placing more emphasis on a common initiative by the social partners for the integration of the young .
we are also going to submit to the social partners the entire complex of problems associated with the integration of the young .
and we are asking for the development of mechanisms based - as i have said just now - on the youth start and leonardo programmes .
this is an initiative to be developed jointly with the commission and member states .
president santer , i hope your perseverance will obtain concrete results at the florence summit .
and with regard to the training and education policy i have not heard anything about a proposal - which was in the white paper - about lifelong learning .
do you not think that the commission should tackle that subject of employment and the training for our human capital , which is so important for the future ?
mr president , mr bar&oacute;n crespo is right to stress this point .
it does indeed appear in our communication , and in the white paper which was presented by mrs cresson .
we must indeed place a very special emphasis on education and continuing vocational training , or the lifelong learning process .
in this context , you will find that our communication has something to say about education and training as levers to open access to employment .
i entirely agree with you that these elements are becoming a key factor in the framework of these activities designed to reduce unemployment , especially among the young .
mr president , i want to congratulate president santer on his continuing efforts to get national governments as well as the european institutions to give this serious problem the priority it deserves .
in doing that i hope we will not give the national governments an opportunity to create the impression that the responsibility for high rates of unemployment lies with europe .
since national governments control taxation policies , social welfare policies , working hours and rates of pay , obviously it is there that the greater part of the responsibility lies .
the president of the commission pointed out that the parts of the structural funds not being spent are an embarrassment since we need greater investment to create more employment .
would the president agree with me that perhaps the additionality clause in the regulations needs to be looked at ?
on the one hand we are saying to governments that they must reduce their deficits and taxation , on the other they must increase spending in order to match european money .
does he think that this policy needs to be reviewed and that an individual regulation to suit each member state is required in the spending of structural funds ?
i believe that these funds still offer a great many opportunities , because three-quarters of them are used in regions where two-thirds of our unemployment is concentrated .
in that same context , you also refer to taxation .
i can tell you that the commission has drafted a communication on taxation , in connection with which we are currently discussing the relations between direct taxation , indirect taxation and the tax on employment .
this , then , is an overall programme , and when it is studied is important not to take individual points out of context .
you are right to lay particular stress on the importance of the structural funds which , perhaps , are not being sufficiently used to reduce unemployment in the regions in question .
first of all , president santer , bravo .
you can attend the forthcoming summit meetings confident in the strong support of this parliament .
however , i cannot refrain from expressing my major fear .
all these measures are small-scale ones .
flexibilization , tax improvements , better training - all these things are necessary . the ideas are right .
what troubles me is the tempo , which will take between 20 and 25 years to eliminate european unemployment .
president santer , why do not you include a serious question to the member states , a suggestion that working hours should be massively reduced , which is the only weapon we have not yet used ?
mr president , prime minister rocard is certainly right to stress a number of matters which , indeed , must be included in our overall strategy if it is to produce concrete results .
on the other hand , it is appropriate to include a number of factors such as the length and arrangement of working hours , and we have examined this question in section 3 ( 15 ) of our communication .
we consider that this is a special project which needs to be debated , negotiated and discussed between the social partners , and i alerted them to the fact at the round table on 28 and 29 april .
this is an important debate which concerns all our member states , and not one in which the commission can impose a decision .
in other words , this is a whole group of problems which covers what you have called working hours .
we need to be innovative in this area , and i hope this is one of the major lines of thought which our social partners will be pursuing .
i was particularly interested in one thing president santer said , and i am sure everyone who works in the agriculture sector will be too .
he said great britain has , for the first time , come up with proposals useful for restoring confidence .
mr president , as far as employment is concerned , it is of course possible to establish certain links between bse and the culling of livestock .
a number of social problems have also been created , especially in rural areas and in the agricultural sector .
i am certainly not unaware of the scale of this problem as regards the matter with which we are currently concerned .
on the other hand , i must tell you that the matters proposed to us yesterday by the british delegation will the subject of further discussions .
what is at issue is a step-by-step approach to the ultimate lifting of the embargo .
so a framework has been established .
i believe this is the right approach , and indeed it is the approach which we have been constantly recommending since the crisis began , ever since 20 or 21 march .
the first essential is to restore consumer confidence so as to bring market stability via specific activities designed to eradicate bse - mad cow disease - completely .
the british delegation has made a number of proposals to us .
commissioner fischler will be presenting them to you tomorrow . he is the expert in these matters , not me .
my only regret , and i say this frankly before your parliament , is that we have wasted at least six to eight weeks before reaching any specific solutions .
that is my regret , and that is why i share your apprehension .
mr president , two short questions . yesterday the council of ministers , without the united kingdom , adopted the directive on parental leave .
the commission is very alert to competition problems .
does it not feel that the absence of the child-minding directive in a single country might distort competition between the states ?
my second question is this : our states are caught between two fires . one is compliance with the convergence criteria , and the other is the reduction of tax capabilities .
as you are well aware , the commission - in common with parliament - requested that the social chapter should be integrated into the treaty at the intergovernmental conference .
i believe this is the right thing to do , and we shall support it fully ; i hope that an agreement on this matter will be reached at the intergovernmental conference .
this programme contains lines of thought which commissioner monti has identified and which were the subject of discussions at the informal ecofin council held in verona six weeks ago .
this approach ensures that joint consideration will have been given to the balance between the taxes on earned and unearned income .
mr president , i should like to congratulate mr santer on putting such a high priority on unemployment .
but i am rather afraid that the confidence pact will seem to be an idol with feet of clay , because i still do not see any real pact .
i think several parties are needed for a pact and as far as i know the social partners are not really ready at this time to conclude a pact and the position with the member states is the same .
i should like to ask mr santer how he thinks of bringing about a really serious pact .
besides , my view is that the commission must set the example .
the leonardo programme has been a failure on a number of occasions as an example where cooperation is possible between social partners and the business world .
i think we cannot be serious if we approach a pact in this way .
this commitment to negotiations between the social partners could initially be reached on four matters , which seem to me essential , as of now . negotiations must begin .
we have the result of initial negotiations on parental leave .
we have need to go further .
one line of approach , it seems to me , relates to part-time working , which is atypical , and would in itself represent a significant support for the concept of the pact .
secondly , the social partners are going to try to produce a joint manifesto - that is what they have agreed to do - on the integration of young people in the employment market .
thirdly , they are going to produce a framework text on training , which is equally essential as a lever for providing access to employment .
and fourthly , they are going to produce a joint opinion on the structural funds .
all this in itself seems to me to represent a very decisive commitment by the social partners at that level .
mr president , as the third pillar in your proposals for improving labour-market policy you referred to the electricity sector , the creation of the single electricity market .
i should like to ask how you assess the value of the single energy market in terms of new job opportunities .
is energy , as a cost factor of location in europe , not perhaps being overpriced here ?
should not rather the alternative and regenerative forms of energy technology be developed and encouraged more vigorously , so that such innovations can lead to real new jobs in europe and new export opportunities for companies based in europe ?
have we not been grossly underestimating the importance of environmental protection as a means of securing and creating jobs ?
mr president , i can say that i am in agreement with what the honourable member has said where it is not in conflict with what i have just said .
what we want to do with the internal market is to take full advantage of all its potential .
that market has been created by a number of directives , but it is not yet functioning as an internal market , since some sectors are still protected .
we have decided to liberalize telecommunications .
we have now made proposals to the effect that the electricity market should also be liberalized , but that is not the same as saying that we are opposed to alternative energy sources .
quite the reverse .
what we are trying to achieve is a situation where this internal market really functions as an integrated internal market , on the model of the american market , which operates as an internal market with a single currency .
we have not yet reached that point .
that is why european business is still unable to exploit all the potential inherent in this internal market .
not taking any risks is the greatest risk , president santer , as you so rightly said .
so it is not a matter of merely producing piecemeal measures but of ensuring that we create a common framework .
we do not want any new structural-fund resources but rather more effective application of the existing structural funds .
we do not want to create any new local employment initiatives in competition with smes ; such action should be taken as a parallel effort accompanying in a fair and balanced manner our promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises .
is it not equally necessary to tell them that we must devote more of our resources to practical education and to the promotion of vocational training ?
but in our view this also means that we must not reduce still further the already meagre leonardo funds .
we must therefore make it clear to these countries that it is not a matter of pursuing new whimsical policies but quite simply of distributing more prudently the funds that are available .
mr president , i am in agreement with the honourable member , because - as i have been at pains to make clear - we are not intending to reinvent the wheel .
we want to build on the substance of the 1993 white paper on competitiveness , employment and competition , but we are not trying to extend our jurisdiction .
what we are aiming at is better allocation of the resources that will be available to us between now and 1999 , and this applies equally to the structural funds and to the transeuropean networks .
i am surprised , incidentally , that no member has yet mentioned the question of the transeuropean networks , a question that has arisen at every european council .
that is our approach , and it is within that framework that we specifically want to implement , step by step and in the context of an overall strategy , all the elements of the 1993 white paper .
mr president , i must ask commission president santer to elucidate two points relating to the communication concerning the employment pact .
you said that the commission is to launch a joint pact in which the parties will be compelled to participate in the confidence pact .
however , criticism is in fact growing among economists , among politicians and , above all , among the general public .
so , what kind of consensus is it , mr president ?
is there not rather a yawning chasm separating us from anything resembling consensus ?
mr president , as far as the first question is concerned , we certainly do not want to compel the social partners to reach an agreement - quite the reverse .
there is no question whatever of constraint , at any stage .
there is no question at all of constraint , quite the reverse .
this is a matter of considered approach .
i can assure you , the social partners whom i have met in all the member states , without exception , are ready to meet this challenge .
they are ready to commit themselves because they are the parties most closely concerned , and they are aware of the challenge that has to be met in the interests of tomorrow 's society .
as far as the second question is concerned , it is of course true that economic and monetary union is one of the crucial elements for completing the internal market .
i know of no other internal market in the world - as we are the largest - with 370 million inhabitants - that functions with 14 different currencies .
we need to realize clearly what that means .
that is the aim of monetary union .
monetary union as such is not an end in itself ; it is the instrument of a policy of economic and social development .
that is how we need to think of it . and that is the spirit of the commitment we must enter into .
we must do away with the idea that monetary union is the enemy of employment .
quite the reverse .
i speak as parliament 's rapporteur on the 1996 annual economic report and on the broad economic guidelines .
i notice that the president of the commission referred to reduction in working time , not adaptation of working time .
mr president , i do of course believe that these matters form an entity within the discussion and must be taken into consideration .
when you read our communication , you will find these matters examined in the context of greater flexibility for our employment market .
we believe that it is necessary to ensure that flexibility is reconciled with security - some people have called this ' flexisecurity ' .
i think this is a matter that needs to be taken into account .
it goes without saying that i am also in favour of reducing the cost of labour , but we shall then have to see how these costs are replaced by other measures , other means .
but the adaptation of working hours by using new forms of so-called atypical work is already becoming the normal , typical way of working in some of our member states .
mr president , president santer has set out an argument which at the end of the day , as far as i am concerned , represents a voluntary declaration , with specific objectives to be achieved .
and you yourself , today , are speaking in the name of competitiveness and proposing to combat unemployment in that name .
first , mr president , it is important to realize that competitiveness is not the enemy of employment .
quite the reverse .
unless you strengthen the competitiveness of a business , you will not increase the number of jobs in the medium and long term .
indeed , the objective today is to strengthen the competitiveness of european business so that it can create new jobs , jobs for the future .
that is the essence of our policy , which is designed to alleviate the sickness from which europe is now suffering .
we are suffering from having lost market shares around the world , because our companies are not as competitive as those in other regions .
that is why we have to boost competitiveness , but in conjunction with the transition to employment .
it is not competitiveness that is killing off jobs , but there is a need to find the link between competitiveness and the creation of new jobs .
that is what we are trying to achieve in chapter 3 of our communication , which i invite you to study very thoroughly .
mr president , my question relates to the swedish debate and the swedish government 's proposal for an employment union .
personally , i think it is an excellent idea .
mr president , i can tell the honourable member that we are in full agreement with the proposals made on this matter by the swedish government in the context of the intergovernmental conference .
i had the opportunity to discuss this subject with the swedish prime minister .
the commission supports the swedish proposals which are not in conflict with the objectives of convergence as laid down .
within that framework , we must strengthen and definitively establish , at the intergovernmental conference , the follow-up procedure regarding the five points agreed on at essen .
by doing so , we will achieve a better balance between the internal market on the one hand and the social aspect on the other , to live up to our citizens ' expectations .
the swedish proposals are on the same lines as the proposals we ourselves made for the benefit of the intergovernmental conference .
i welcome president santer 's discussion of the role of cities , towns and regions in the economic reconstruction of europe .
so much of our discussion about dealing with the unemployment problem takes place at the macro-economic level which seems very remote from the unemployed people we seek to help .
is your announcement of pilot towns and cities mere window-dressing or will it unleash the potential of those towns and cities throughout europe to contribute to the process of economic development ?
will it be like the urban programme and the urban pilot projects , with just twenty or twenty-five towns able to participate or will there be the opportunity for towns and cities throughout our continent to take part ?
will there be the objections we have heard from member states on the grounds of subsidiarity which means they want to hold on to the money and do not want to let our towns and cities take part ?
finally , will there be new money which will go to our towns and cities and which will help them unleash that potential to put people back to work ?
mr president , i do indeed believe that we should be moving more towards regional pacts and municipal pacts .
in a number of cases the member states have had highly encouraging experience of this , through a gradual process of decentralization of employment .
i hope that we will be able to obtain initial approval of these regional pacts when they are presented by the commission at the european council in dublin .
we shall be making appropriate proposals about this to you when the time comes .
i believe that the local development initiatives must be of overriding importance .
that is why we have also emphasized the decentralization of our training systems and the employment systems , which appears us to be essential in order to ensure the employability of certain categories of people , especially the young .
ladies and gentlemen , that ends question time .
i thank everyone who took part , especially the president of the commission , mr santer , who addressed us and answered our questions this afternoon .
i shall now take a point of order from mr holm .
mr president , that is the second time you have called me by the wrong name .
i have already corrected you in the bureau too , and i find it rather irritating that this mistake makes you pass me over at question time , despite my having corrected the error .
i believe it is reasonable to expect the members who are in the bureau to know each other 's names !
my name is voggenhuber .
i accept your criticism .
i am sorry , but in the papers i have here your name and the number of your seat do not correspond .
mistakes can easily happen in that situation .
i do apologize .
you have let some fifteen speakers take the floor .
i must have raised my hand some fifteen times and been amongst the first at least a dozen times ; i am concerned that you might be a little short-sighted in your right eye .
the ladies and gentlemen who have been watching me here over the past few months will know that i am not short-sighted on the left or the right side but on both sides !
agreement with morocco - human rights in morocco and western sahara
mr president , morocco is a very important state to us .
we need only look at the map to realize how important it is , with one coastline on the atlantic and another on the mediterranean .
there are also political factors .
throughout that entire area we should be defending the forces of moderation against extremism and strengthening them .
quite apart from that , we also have numerous cultural points in common .
anyone travelling across spain today on the way to morocco , through seville and on to marrakesh , for example , will observe that the kutubiyah mosque is very similar to the giralda .
the jewish , islamic and christian religions were represented there simultaneously , as can surely be recognized in the cathedral of toledo .
so we have various reasons for developing our common ground with morocco .
in addition , it is a fact that there are two states in the arab and islamic world which are very close to us .
one of them is the sultanate of oman in the southern part of the arabian peninsula and the other is morocco .
it is said time and again about morocco , of course , that there are human rights abuses in that country .
i do not deny that ; it is undoubtedly the case .
the fact is that there are various levels of culture and development .
we should not simply say that everything has to be done in accordance with our standard .
the crucial thing is how a country develops , and it must be said that morocco has made enormous progress , especially in recent decades , including progress towards greater democracy .
that is why i believe that morocco is really entitled to our attention , that we should make serious efforts to provide morocco with the necessary connections and give it tangible support .
the sahara question is also aired very frequently .
i think i am probably the only one here in parliament who can say that i made my first visit to the sahara more than fifty years ago .
there is no particular merit in that ; i am , after all , the grandfather of this parliament .
but it does enable me to say one thing , namely that i can see the developments that have taken place there .
when people speak today about voters and registration of voters , they should be fully aware of the situation .
there have been repeated calls to proceed on the basis of a particular register that was drawn up back in the spanish era .
that would be totally wrong .
many new settlers have arrived since then , and their contribution has been truly enormous .
here in europe we still consider it unthinkable to eject people who helped to build our continent .
we should bear that in mind in relation to the sahara too .
then , of course , the old arguments against islam are trotted out time and again , with repeated references to what happened in iran at the time of khomeini .
the various shades of opinion within islam must not simply be lumped together ; it must be recognized that there are various groups within islam and that many of them merit our respect .
there are , however , many who oppose it simply because they are basically racists but who do not have the courage to admit that openly .
this is a fine piece of camouflage under which they introduce this additional factor into the equation .
that is why we should really encourage morocco .
we should accept this agreement , which , incidentally , has been very well negotiated , and we should recognize in particular that if we want to work together there ought to be a certain spirit of friendly openness .
there is an old german proverb which says that flies are not caught with vinegar but with honey .
may i ask the house to take that message to heart and to open the door to the moroccans .
they really do deserve it .
i believe that , for all the reservations certain members of parliament may have - and most of those members are not well acquainted with the situation - we should show the moroccans that we are their friends .
we want to support the moderate islamic states , and above all we want to make the mediterranean a region of peace .
the commission thinks that no-one of good will can deny the substantial progress made in recent years on the subject of human rights in morocco .
the pace of the reforms , their content or their speed leave room for discussion .
of course that does not mean that it has reached a situation which can be regarded as perfect .
and the moroccan authorities themselves , in their political dialogue with the commission , acknowledge in fact that the desired level of observance of human rights has not yet been reached .
they know too that progress must be made in this matter .
this year , 1996 , is decisive for the moroccan constitutional system .
you know that king hassan ii has announced a package of measures concerning reform of the constitution with the object of bringing the moroccan democratic system up to a level which most of you would regard as appropriate .
so parliamentary democracy is , in this very year , 1996 , at the centre of the moroccan internal debate .
i have myself visited the moroccan parliament and have been able to appreciate the intensity of this reform phenomenon , which it is proposed to implement during the second half year .
there are two political approaches to this situation : one is to go on criticizing ; the other is to engage in dialogue and to promote this kind of change which is so fundamental in the moroccan constitution .
moreover it is necessary to vote in favour of the association agreement for another fundamental reason : one of the decisive parts of the association agreement consists precisely of all the provisions with regard to respect for human rights .
the second sensitive issue is the western sahara .
the commission has always contended that the initiative and leadership with regard to the western sahara is a matter for the united nations .
that has always seemed to us the natural setting in which possible negotiations should take place .
the commission regrets that security council decision , but it is a fact that minurso , further reduced , will continue its duties of monitoring the cease-fire .
i imagine that the european union 's position will depend on the final report which the secretary general of the united nations has to draw up , to be submitted , as you know , on 31 august .
mr president , we thank the vice-president of the commission , mr mar&iacute;n , for the detailed explanations he has given us .
the opinion of the committee on external economic relations is to a large extent based on some of the aspects he has mentioned , for example :
this agreement , as the vice-president of the commission has said , includes the conditionality clause on which all relations must be based , that is , on respect for human rights and democratic principles .
we are thankful for the effort morocco has made in this direction .
however , we are concerned about the impasse reached with regard to holding the referendum on the western sahara , because such paralysation might entail real risks for stability in the most western part of the maghreb .
the european union has demonstrated its political will .
for morocco this agreement is a fundamental political option aimed at anchoring its economy and society firmly to europe , but it must not be forgotten that there are also economic risks inherent in carrying out the agreement .
with all this in mind the committee on external economic relations has given its approval with an opinion in favour of the association agreement between the european union and morocco .
we must pay attention to the point made by both the commissioner and the rapporteur , stressing the basic geostrategic situation of the kingdom of morocco .
and we must appreciate the desirability of mutual understanding between two cultures - european and moroccan in this case - for establishing important collaboration .
there is a possibility of exchange of scientific information and of exchanges in the policy of training of research workers which i think might be enormously profitable for both the kingdom of morocco and the european union .
we must not forget sources of energy vital to the european union necessarily pass through morocco .
we must not forget that the european union has important responsibilities to ensure that morocco , which has managed to make moderation its trade mark , is also treated appropriately .
we therefore heartily applaud the association agreement with the kingdom of morocco .
we cannot agree with those who prefer to reject this agreement for purely political reasons , citing the democratic deficit of that country , the question of human rights or of the sahara .
morocco at present is calling insistently at the gates of the european union for help to achieve economic growth .
however , demographic growth there is unstoppable and , if it is not accompanied by job creation , the pressure of migration will continue to rise , with all the accompanying problems .
mr president , parliament 's committee on development and cooperation urges ratification of the agreement with morocco , as another important step in the new euro-mediterranean strategy identified at barcelona last november .
this involves moving to a new strategic equilibrium in the external relations of the european union after the priority given to the central and eastern european countries in recent years .
in fact the stability of europe 's southern flank affects the whole union , and not just the more geographically exposed member states .
secondly , the deadlock on the independence referendum for the saharan people . a few weeks ago the latest amnesty international report stated that the moroccan security forces in western sahara have carried out serious violations of human rights .
condemning this is not a form of racism . in addition , amnesty states that the moroccan government is showing no intention of investigating these violations .
another source of deep concern is the fact that the moroccan government is blocking the united nations security council 's peace process , specifically based on organizing a referendum on self-determination .
the committee also calls on the polisario front to seize the opportunity for peace that exists and continue along the path of dialogue and contact with the united nations .
however , whilst no question arises as to the raison d ' &ecirc;tre of that agreement , it must be mentioned that the sardine processing sector is a real martyr to that agreement .
welcome
i welcome them here and extend to them my best wishes for successful work with us .
agreement with morocco - human rights in morocco and western sahara ( continuation )
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the economic and geostrategic importance of the association agreement on which we are being asked to vote is obvious .
so i will talk about other aspects .
once again , we find ourselves in a position to measure our hopes against the hard yardstick of reality .
reconciling these factors is difficult . no one is perfect .
neither solution is entirely satisfactory .
in our case , these values and forms of behaviour took nearly 200 years to come into existence .
in the islamic cultural sphere , the movement to introduce democracy began much more recently .
we can reasonably criticize those who reject it , but not those who are merely lagging behind .
the current position is that the human rights situation in morocco is unsatisfactory .
there are many political prisoners . no one can be sure that torture is not continuing .
the course of justice is being obstructed in the search for certain missing persons .
the peace process in western sahara is deadlocked .
that is the immediate position .
in comparison terms , mr president , morocco has slowly become one of the least dictatorial of the arab states .
in the arab world , which has had a raw deal from history , the only territory governed by an elected democracy is the palestinian authority .
its closest rivals in the progression towards international standards of democracy are the two kingdoms of jordan and morocco .
are we going to treat morocco as if it was iraq ?
do we want to support the reactionary islamic forces within that country which are opposing closer links with the west , even trade links ?
we in the socialist group have been very hesitant about this .
eventually , we adopted the position i have had the pleasure of presenting to you .
we must vote in favour .
mr president , for us the approval of the euro-maghreb agreement under discussion today has the greatest importance .
on the other hand this represents a demand put forward years ago by the european parliament and particularly by its committees on foreign affairs and on development and cooperation .
the agreement we are discussing has an economic and commercial content , aimed fundamentally at the economic and social development of the kingdom of morocco and the growth of economic and commercial relations between morocco and the european union .
mr president , the agreement with morocco arrives third , after the agreements with tunisia and israel .
with this are being created the conditions to fill a void in these two policies for europe , a void which has been untenable up to now .
true , there is the painful aspect of human rights .
and it is right to demand that they be strictly protected and also demand the acceleration of the process of democratic reform .
we owe it to ourselves however also to take account of the fact that the persistence of conditions that are not at all satisfactory runs parallel to the existence of a risk of serious emergency .
i therefore associate myself with the opinion mr von habsburg has expressed in his excellent report and i propose , on behalf of my group , approval of the ratification of the association agreement .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we should all like to live in the kingdom of utopia so well described by sir thomas more , except that utopia is always taken to be something illusory .
for these reasons i think the agreement which the european union is intending to conclude with morocco , consolidating and developing what has already been achieved in the sphere i mentioned , is essential .
we shall therefore vote against this association agreement between the european union and morocco .
how sad it is to hear in this house that progress has been made because a few political prisoners have been released !
how sad to hear in this house that there is less infringement of human rights !
how sad to hear in this house that although democracy has not been established by a particular government and human rights are not fully respected , nevertheless relations with that government must be privileged !
mr president , the green group will vote against this proposal .
i myself shall do the same , not because i am an anti-arab racist but because in my own country i am known as perhaps one of the foremost friends of the arabs .
i cannot accept the inverted racism which means that the suppression of freedom in arab countries is acceptable on account of their culture and traditions .
those who take this line are no true friends of the arab world .
for us western sahara is a crucial point .
the question is when it will be appropriate to enter into an association agreement with morocco .
the security council recently decided to extend the minurso mandate in the hope that it will be possible to resume identification work .
in that connection the security council particularly stressed that saharan political prisoners in morocco must be released .
we in the green group regard greater cooperation around the mediterranean in a very positive light .
there should be no doubt about that .
however , we believe that right now it would be extraordinarily inappropriate to give king hassan and his regime political support by approving the agreement .
it would also be an insult to the legitimate battle for freedom being conducted by the people of western sahara .
mr president , michel rocard said earlier that we must choose between our unreasonably high expectations and bitter reality .
i often think that we find ourselves having to choose between commercial interests and democratic values .
it is indeed tragic that the european parliament , when push comes to shove , so often chooses commercial interests in preference to democratic values .
the fact is that there are two factors that can militate against the adoption of the text before us today .
the basic freedoms , those formal freedoms that our communist comrades used to talk about , are still granted grudgingly , if at all .
to be resolutely hostile to government policy is no sinecure , no kind of picnic at all .
all these things are still true but , to be a little more specific , they are becoming less and less true .
and we need to help our democratic friends in morocco to ensure that these things are no longer true at all .
we should note though , in passing , that those who vow to bring down the regime and the moroccan kingdom are not all apostles of liberty - far from it .
the second point which seems to be deterring some of our colleagues from endorsing the text produced by our rapporteur , otto von habsburg - who , incidentally , i must congratulate - is the matter of western sahara .
the ' green march ' and the de facto annexation of the territory more than 20 years ago have led to results that cannot be accepted as things stand .
clearly , it is necessary to consult the views of the people . but to accuse morocco of sabotaging the referendum process is simplistic , to put it mildly .
let us be close to the moroccans .
let us move even closer to them .
it may be good business , but it is certainly right .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , parliament has to be realistic .
since the first days of independence , morocco has pursued a dual objective : defending its own identity while developing in partnership with europe .
this bold and courageous choice was not , and is not , free of risk for the policy makers who made that choice and are still pursuing it .
the stability of morocco cannot be taken for granted : it is the product of the determination of morocco 's rulers , and our cooperation has its part to play there .
by supporting this kind of development , then , we shall at the same time be helping to combat illegal immigration .
development , stability , openness , progress towards democracy even if that progress is sometimes hesitant - all these trends at any rate deserve our encouragement and support .
we have an opportunity to express that encouragement and support clearly and specifically by approving mr von habsburg 's report and the association agreement upon which we are being asked to vote .
let us not miss that opportunity .
yet the association agreement you are offering us gives rise to serious reservations on our part , the same reservations that we have entered in all similar cases .
ladies and gentlemen , before we presume to give lessons to the king of morocco , let us start by putting our own house in order .
in many ways , there is more freedom of expression in morocco than there is in europe .
so the moroccans can do without your lessons on the right way to behave , as can we .
the main thrust of our reservations concerns the underlying nature of the maastricht system .
it is presented as being a stabilizing factor in moroccan society . if the european union were to produce that effect , it would be something new .
what about your political imperialism , the arrogance of our subculture , the destruction of our spiritual values ?
do you want to impose all that on morocco ?
the second reason relates to title vi and article 64 : the alignment of the rights of moroccan nationals with those of our own nationals .
clearly , moroccans do have rights abroad , just as foreigners have rights in morocco .
but it seems to us that those rights should be determined by ordinary international civil law .
we have just been talking about unemployment in europe .
as far as this is concerned , the corrective factors referred to in article 71 are unlikely to be much of a barrier .
thirdly , we have always believed that the european union should confine itself to a european political , economic and cultural area .
if not , and it is embarrassing to have to make such obvious points , it ceases to be a european entity and becomes one step on the road towards the construction of a global entity .
in conclusion , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , what we needed here was not a general free-trade agreement but an agreement on cooperation , close cooperation .
it is true that the mediterranean countries are as deserving of our attention as those of central europe , but you have not gone the right way about strengthening our links with this great country .
here morocco plays a very important part as a bridge between the maghreb and the union .
in the past few years a cautious beginning has been made in the sphere of democracy . commissioner mar&iacute;n has just confirmed that .
admittedly it is all a small start .
the human rights situation in morocco is still far from ideal , but , ladies and gentlemen , a rejection of the association agreement before us will certainly not bring respect for human rights any closer .
only a critical dialogue with all levels of moroccan society can bring closer the advancement of the state governed by the rule of law which we so keenly wish to see .
above all to approve it in order to avoid even the slightest risk of seeing morocco slide down into an algerian situation .
that must be avoided .
i have received two motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .
in the committee on budgets we gave an opinion favourable to the association agreement between the european union and the kingdom of morocco in a letter signed by the chairman of the committee himself .
for those reasons therefore this agreement may be approved .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the agreement we have been asked to approve today is an especially important one both for our member states and for the kingdom of morocco .
it is this last point , the creation of a region of peace and prosperity , that i would like to stress .
as far as the kingdom of morocco is concerned , we want to encourage it to pursue its economic reforms and political liberalization .
that is why , incidentally , the agreement includes a clause authorizing its suspension in the event of any violation of these fundamental principles .
mr president , it would not be reasonable , then , to expect the european parliament not to give its assent to the agreement between the union and morocco .
mr president , the euromediterranean agreements may help to strengthen cooperation with the mediterranean countries , and i am in favour of them .
but they must find expression in genuine cooperation , based on mutual advantage and free of any thought of domination .
i have to say that they are too much dictated by the ultraliberal logic of creating competition between economies and nations , based on free trade and the free movement of capital .
furthermore , the agreements cannot be confined to financial and commercial aspects , leaving aside the questions of democracy and human rights .
undeniably , significant results have been achieved by morocco in this field , thanks to the international mobilization of opinion to which this house made a powerful contribution .
prisoners have been released , missing persons have emerged from their secret prisons , yet there is still much to do before it can be said that human rights are really being respected .
the situation in western sahara , which was one of the main reasons this house rejected the financial protocol with morocco in 1992 , has not improved . the moroccan government is still pursuing its policy of obstructiveness .
unfortunately , it is enjoying the tacit support of certain member states and of the united nations , whose secretary general has just decided to suspend the process of elector identification .
but there are differences .
libya , for instance , is not one of the states involved in the meda programme .
morocco differs from the other mediterranean states in that it has occupied the western sahara .
the european parliament has always taken a clear and unequivocal position on morocco and the western sahara .
the realization of the sahrawi people 's right to self-determination has always been a matter of priority for us .
we bear special political responsibility here too .
the sahrawi people have lived in refugee camps for 20 years .
that is the result of an irresponsible policy pursued in the postcolonial era .
that we should give humanitarian aid to the refugees and to the refugee camps is therefore a dictate of our humanity and part of our historical obligation .
but before we can sign or approve this agreement here today , we need a political solution for the western sahara , and that means moroccan withdrawal from the western sahara .
the peace process was a good start .
the ceasefire agreement was important .
but the referendum is also important to us .
some people are still saying that dialogue is needed .
we can see how dialogue works in the wake of the agreement with turkey .
there is dialogue . there are spanish and french tourist organizations represented in morocco , there are fisheries , arms exports , police training in germany .
we want peace in the mediterranean basin , but only on condition that morocco demonstrates real commitment to it .
otherwise we advocate waiting until the referendum has actually taken place .
but that must not prevent us from drawing attention to the human rights situation in that country .
i am thinking above all of cases of persecution of religious minorities , particularly christians .
only recently we received information about that from the european evangelical alliance .
that is remarkable because religious freedom is basically guaranteed in morocco , which has also signed various international human rights conventions .
there therefore appears to be a serious discrepancy between the national authorities ' policy of tolerance and the application of that policy by the local authorities .
it must be discussed with the national authorities .
in addition morocco must show signs of greater cooperation as regards moroccans wanting to return from europe to their home country .
returning is not at present an attractive prospect since the moroccan authorities do hardly anything in the way of reception and guidance .
in spite of what i have said we shall give our support to the association agreement .
i must say very clearly that the most important thing is its historic significance .
the fact that this agreement is going to have to be ratified by the 15 parliaments of the member states of the union may give us an idea of its parliamentary importance .
but , ladies and gentlemen , let us give it a chance and let us have patience to sort things out .
we are speaking about an agreement which has not yet come into being .
it is an agreement looking towards the future .
everything in it relates to commitments for the immediate short- , medium- or long-term future .
it is an association agreement designed to bring about a different state of affairs .
let us not fall into the trap of turning this into a test for good behaviour .
on the contrary , it is a question of making this association agreement what it is : a means of overcoming the past and taking a step towards a new situation in the future .
how odd that the extreme parliamentary groups on both sides should finally agree on the same position , by different routes but both of them on a negative vote !
let us look towards progress !
let us vote in favour !
mr president , this agreement with morocco is a good example of lack of transparency .
in addition , in the case of this agreement there are other weighty reasons for rejecting it .
to start with political reasons , notably the systematic procrastination and undermining of international decisions on the independence of the sahara ; it also has a profoundly unbalanced economy .
we reject the hypocrisy of those who state that these are economically unimportant sectors .
mr president , we all want to strengthen our links with morocco .
we admire the courage and energy of our many moroccan friends , including the moroccan mps who are with us yet again in parliament , with whom we have a very active dialogue .
i should like to congratulate mr von habsburg , our colleague who describes morocco as a plural democracy .
he has again shown he is a good friend of the king of morocco and , unfortunately , an apologist for the illegal occupation of the western sahara by morocco .
this parliament has consistently deplored that illegal occupation which has resulted in loss of life , political prisoners , torture and suffering for some of the most vulnerable people in the world for far too long .
in seeking closer links with morocco for our mutual benefit , this parliament is entitled to expect morocco to show respect for international law , for human rights and for self-determination for the people of the western sahara .
( applause )
mr president , i shall vote , with conviction and hope for the future , in favour of this report .
in view of spain 's subsequent experience i am in favour of this agreement and of support for the most active sectors of society .
of course i feel , like so many others , frustration at the present situation of the conflict in the sahara .
but i think that this agreement is one step further in that most important process initiated in barcelona and we must welcome that .
we need this stability ; we need economic , institutional and cultural ties with the mediterranean . that is true .
and especially with morocco , that is even more true .
i would like to dwell on the two points which are causing a problem . first human rights , and then of course the reference to turkey .
we are not all that sure , ladies and gentlemen , that we did the right thing when we voted in favour of turkey 's entry into the customs union ; we are not sure .
a fortnight ago we were very dubious , and every day we worried that we may have been wrong .
the situation is not the same for those who know the moroccan people .
no , it is not the same .
let us bank on it being very different .
then , of course , there is also the matter of the saharans .
i have no great enthusiasm for the way they are being treated , i must say , by algeria and in the camps with which i am familiar .
i have no great enthusiasm for it - quite the reverse . but i know that they fought courageously .
i know that some of them are deeply sincere , and i know that causes a problem .
let us put our trust in the un .
let us keep the pressure on .
this referendum is necessary .
let us not abandon the saharans .
certainly not !
i am taking this gamble , yes , because i believe that there are times in politics when we should follow the dictates of our hearts because our heads are not sure of the way .
that is why my vote will be in favour of the moroccans .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
non-admission of croatia to the council of europe
the next item is the statement by the council on the non-admission of croatia to the council of europe .
the european union agrees with the council of europe 's approach .
in fact , the positions of the fifteen states of the european union , members of the council of europe , have tended to be coordinated in support of the position the council of europe has taken .
mr president , it will not surprise this president-in-office of the council that i entirely agree with him .
my group was indignant about the proposal from the assembly of the council of europe to admit croatia , albeit conditionally , as a full member of the council of europe .
in our view croatia , or must we say the croatian government , does not at present meet the criteria .
not long since , the president refused to accept the democratically elected mayor of zagreb and did everything in his power to prevent the appointment .
the independent media are seriously hampered in croatia , and as has been said , the situation of the refugees and the minorities is very unsatisfactory .
there are thus reasons enough for keeping up the pressure on the croatian government .
that actually applies as well to croatia 's role in the peace process .
as long as full cooperation with for example the war crimes tribunal at the hague is not established and the crisis round mostar is not settled , europe must not be in a hurry with its recognition of croatia .
my group supports the policy of the council of europe 's committee of ministers to defer a decision about the admission of croatia .
we welcome the response of the european union . we are also glad that the political committee of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe supports this proposal .
we shall follow developments closely and we ask the council of europe to keep us informed of its findings in the coming months .
and more generally we shall follow closely the council of europe 's admission policy .
previously we debated the admission of the russian federation to the council of europe .
i also think it is disturbing that the european parliament and the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe came close to adopting opposite views on this matter .
that is a pity because the council of europe may in a sense be an antechamber for the european union in particular where assessing human rights situations is concerned .
if this parliament and the assembly of the council of europe are going to interpret criteria differently we shall have a serious problem .
i hope the content of the european parliament 's resolution will cause our colleagues there to think again .
we in the european people 's party and the group of the european people 's party support croatia and its people , as well as its parliament and government , in this aspiration .
on the other hand , we know that the only way to their goal involves complete democratization .
like all other states of central europe , croatia must establish the same democratic rights and rules of play that apply in the countries of the european union itself .
croatia has already made great progress towards becoming a democratic and pluralist society .
in the peace process it has taken a moderate line , and its position is now one of commitment to peaceful solutions .
the economic and social groups - employers , trade unions and the other associations - are free and active .
croatia , in our opinion , is pursuing a prudent economic and monetary policy .
most of the conditions are in place for reconstruction to be carried out in a climate of stability .
however , now that hostilities have largely ceased , we want the croatian government itself to keep all the rules of democracy .
freedom of the press and respect for democratic decisions and election results at all levels are indispensable prerequisites .
we are opposed to discriminatory treatment of croatia in the domain of human rights .
we should regard it as hypocritical , for instance , if the council of europe were to admit russia despite the war in chechnya but ultimately refused to admit croatia even if the croats fulfilled the required conditions .
for the municipal government of zagreb too , a solution must be found which is politically sound and which respects the outcome of democratic elections .
the european union , for its part , should do everything possible to ensure that the resources available under the phare programme are committed at long last to the specific aims of developing the economy and democracy .
to sum up , we believe that the ball is now in the croatian court .
mr president , in recent years this parliament has pressed the governments of the union to intervene to re-establish peace and respect for human rights in the countries of former yugoslavia .
so it is urgent to make this stand and it is right to make it firm and clear .
we are in favour of conditional cooperation with croatia , which must provide further guarantees of the irreversible democratic development of its institutions .
all this means the croatian government needs to show further signs of respect for democratic principles .
when this parliament approved the extension of the phare programme to croatia , it was unanimously made conditional on respect for democratic principles .
so i believe the council , and especially the commission , should not hesitate to demand the suspension of phare if zagreb continues in the direction it has taken .
on this last point i ask the president-in-office of the council to make the position clear to ensure that later , as we all hope , we can proceed to the agreements .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the green group entirely agrees with the council of europe 's committee of ministers in their decision provisionally to defer acceptance of croatia as a member of that council .
there is indeed every reason for doing so .
more than a year ago it was already decided in this parliament by a considerable majority that there were serious problems in connection with democratic execution of policy in croatia .
first i would cite the independent media which certainly suffer under croatian government repression .
so that is why we say : we agree about looking very carefully at developments in the future .
but croatia 's application needs to be assessed on its own merits . otherwise the credibility of the council of europe would be still further impaired .
it is generally known that the protection of fundamental freedoms in croatia still leaves a good deal to be desired .
the media are under severe restraint and the independence of the judiciary is not guaranteed .
in addition president tudjman 's conduct is controversial and there is little cooperation with the international tribunal on war crimes .
but the state of the peace process in the former yugoslavia above all makes us cautious for the present .
croatia 's membership of the council of europe would favourably encourage a change of conduct , but in view of the sluggish process of implementation of the dayton agreement we think accession would at the moment be premature .
compliance with croatia 's application might moreover act as a precedent with regard to bosnia and what is left of yugoslavia .
so , although we think that croatia must be able to join the council of europe , we can agree with the decision to defer it provisionally .
mr president , my understanding was that as a general rule our parliament was against exclusion , but there is one area where europe favours exclusion - the exclusion of croatia .
as far back as 1991 europe 's leaders had refused to recognize the independence of that country , which was then freeing itself from the federal and socialist yoke of yugoslavia .
they did not allow that nation to join the international community until january 1992 , when a third of its territory was occupied by the yugoslav federal army .
today , croatia has gained its freedom , but it is still not in good odour with this house or with the council of europe .
indeed , the council of europe is refusing to allow croatia to join the club . the reason cited is the croatian government 's failure to respect human rights , in particular freedom of the press .
as if those principles were applied in every one of the thirty-nine member states !
is freedom of the press , or even freedom of elections , better respected in russia than in croatia ?
it 's doubtful , to say the least .
as if that were not enough , the journalist in question is seriously ill .
these appalling events happened not in zagreb but in paris .
so perhaps it is time for european governments to respect human rights at home instead of being so fussy about what happens elsewhere .
i should also like to mention the subject of the minorities .
the problem of the treatment of minorities in croatia is serious and must be solved urgently in relation to those who have left .
moreover i think that the involvement of croatia in herzegovina and in support for the bands of mafiosi and ultra-radical fascists operating in the region of herzegovina will not escape anyone who knows bosnia .
croatia has a direct responsibility for that and only by the will of croatia can the present situation be prevented from dragging on .
finally i should like to say that equally firm , but different , measures will have to be applied to serbia .
mr president , it is a pity that mrs aelvoet had to finish before she needed to .
with us membership of the council of europe has always been something of a hallmark for a state where the rule of law prevails , a genuine democracy .
we find it particularly disappointing and it is also particularly displeasing to us , to the european union , that the council of europe no longer acts as that kind of hallmark .
that is why we as a group take such an interest in paragraph 5 of the resolution in which the council of europe is requested to state what its accession policy actually is .
if there are alterations we should be glad to hear of them .
to some extent when it comes to enlarging the european union we are a little dependent on the policy they follow .
then we naturally think of turkey , of russia and sometimes of other countries too .
we always have mixed feelings about croatia .
on the one hand there are politicians who are clearly on our side , people who are genuinely from a state where the rule of law and a democratic environment prevail and then there are others .
so we continually have problems with croatia because we do not really know what choice they are actually making .
mr president , there is increasing confusion in this chamber and parliament 's credibility is evaporating fast .
then there are the many commitments made by tudjman and the president of the croatian parliament and never respected , for example , its unwillingness to cooperate in arresting war criminals .
turkey 's customs union with europe has not been assessed with equal seriousness and objectivity !
but unfortunately these are not the only contradictions in this parliament : human rights come second to the interests of the few and i am afraid hypocrisy triumphs .
mr president , the decision to postpone admission of croatia to the council of europe is important and correct .
it is important that the countries which are admitted to the council of europe respect the fundamental rules and principles which the institution is in fact there to safeguard .
croatia at present does not do this .
anything else would completely undermine the council of europe 's credibility .
there are also extremely worrying developments in croatia as regards press freedom .
in practice , the government is attempting to silence those critical newspapers which exist .
this applies to novi list , which is published in rijeka , the only independent daily newspaper left .
it applies to the satirical weekly paper , feral tribune , against whose staff legal proceedings have been brought for criticising the president , something which is illegal under section 77 of the croatian criminal code .
such provisions are totally inappropriate in a democratic state .
article 10 of the european convention on human rights stipulates that freedom of expression shall be guaranteed .
croatia is unfortunately not complying with this provision , and we therefore support the decision not to admit the country to the council of europe at present .
mr president , along with mr mendiluce pereiro i went to bosnia last week to study the situation for myself .
we travelled by road from croatia into the state of bosnia .
as we entered bosnia we saw a huge election poster for president tudjman of croatia .
at first i thought this was a mistake but the deeper we went into the bosnian state the more we saw of these huge posters .
they symbolized the extent to which president tudjman is prepared to ignore the dayton accords and is prepared to fulfil his own agenda in undermining the peace agreement in bosnia .
obviously the international community cannot ignore such deliberate defiance .
i support the decision taken by the council of europe .
we want to see the return of refugees and we want to see free and fair elections .
the essential prerequisite for free and fair elections is a free media .
this is manifestly not in existence on the croatian side .
therefore i support this decision by the council of europe .
mr president , croatia is an emergent democracy , and that is why we support the demands made by the council .
allow me , however , to address the president-in-office of the council and to put to him the urgent plea that the council apply the same yardsticks , the same criteria .
i was the rapporteur on romania for the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe .
the list of unfulfilled demands made by the council of europe was far longer than the list referred to here for croatia .
yet romania was admitted , and of course is now under obligation to meet these requirements gradually .
the same terms , i submit , must be granted to romania .
the same criteria must be applied here , and that is why mr oostlander and mr schwaiger have both cited point 5 of the resolution .
there is no point in trying to be more catholic than the pope here .
thank you for those speeches . i have taken note of the points made and the presidency will make sure the council is informed .
i just want to emphasize two points here .
to do this we must be capable of sustaining and assisting the process .
we feel we have a duty to do everything possible to ensure that these rights can be guaranteed , assured and achieved .
i think we should take the same attitude towards every country engaged in transition .
i have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .
the debate is closed .
the vote will be taken at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
elections in albania
the next item is the statement by the council on the elections in albania .
members are naturally aware of the progress of events so i do not need to go over what has happened in the last few weeks in albania .
this series of contacts has allowed us to bring together a number of points which are set out in the statement issued by the italian presidency last friday on behalf of the european union .
so even if the climate was much calmer , there is no doubt that the second round was nullified by the abnormal situation .
in short , the completion of the first and second rounds of the election has not resolved the crisis situation in albania .
some parties entered appeals at an early stage involving 41 constituencies and , according to the latest information received today , further appeals entered in the last few hours involve 97 constituencies .
more importantly , the central electoral commission seems to have autonomously decided , according to the news received today , and independently of the appeals , to carry out a general review of the counts in all the seats .
it seems to me that these considerations lead to two conclusions , which i set out here for members .
we need to understand what is going on and what is likely to happen , so the view i have expressed today will have to be updated later .
the elections in albania were a fiasco .
we were afraid from the beginning that the government was not dealing absolutely gently with the opposition and there were many signs of that .
i think we may say that the albanian government may also be held responsible for the way in which those elections were conducted .
there were serious irregularities . we heard of intimidation and any protest at the way things were going was put down with violence .
we think the elections were simply not fair and most observers agree .
political life was made impossible for the opposition .
it is understandable that they are prepared to not work in a fraudulently elected parliament .
president berisha may be held personally responsible for this tragedy .
he creates the impression that he is busy trying to consolidate an autocratic regime as if albania had not had enough of that .
with that he is forcing his country afresh into isolation .
the council 's first appraisal is very reserved .
they want to wait to see what official reports bring in the next few weeks .
so the council is not willing to go further in its assessment than is the case today .
that is also why we are getting no answer to all our questions .
it must be made clear to the albanian government that its conduct has been entirely unacceptable .
it has ridden roughshod over european standards . we must also , i think , be entitled to draw conclusions from that .
we hope president berisha will do so too , otherwise i foresee a very difficult period in relations between albania and the european union .
we ask the commission and the council to make this view clear to president berisha in unmistakable terms .
the elections must be held again to rectify the situation which has now arisen .
a call for dialogue between the parties is to our minds a weak response .
mr president , unlike mr wiersma i am quite favourably impressed by the answer from the presidency of the council . i think it is very fair to wait and see what developments the next few days bring .
this council presidency has clearly pinpointed the sensitive areas and has spoken of the need for a possible partial re-run of the elections in some districts .
there are indications that the council may also quite likely be able to give a more detailed commentary at the next plenary part-session as mr wiersma asked .
of course albania has been a problem for us all for a long time .
true , it is a small country , and it is close at hand , but as regards development it is still a country which is a long way down on the list of world powers .
naturally that goes hand in hand with a very badly developed public administration .
we must take that into account .
when we see how the parties over there stand against one another , government parties and opposition parties of various shades , we can only be surprised about their destructive attitude towards one another .
we see that the idea of the public interest on which a different view might perhaps be taken , actually hardly exists .
that of course does not mean that we must resign ourselves to it .
i wonder whether it would not be useful for the commission to give parliament a policy report with regard to a country like albania .
but in that sphere too - we have just had the experience with croatia -it is particularly necessary for phare democracy funds to be used to the best advantage .
i should be glad to hear the commission 's view and possibly those of the council as well .
i think that we owe that to the albanian people and that it is the only proper way to proceed .
at the same time certain voters , known to be members of the governing party , received multiple ballot papers . opening hours for polling stations were extended during voting and then changed by the various chairmen .
what i want to say is that there is no question of resolving the matter with just four constituencies .
the whole election should be re-run , yet we do not even know who will control the electoral commission , if it carries out a review in all the constituencies .
that is why i am asking for pressure to be put on albania to re-run the elections and the greens will table a motion along those lines at strasbourg .
so it is important for the political dialogue to be geared precisely to understanding what is going on .
so we need to begin a careful evaluation , be present on the ground and see if there is some way we can intervene .
so that is what we think is important , before making any choice , ...
( the president cut the speaker off )
mr president , i have listened to honourable members but , if i may say so , i have the impression that honourable members did not listen to me !
so i would like to take a few minutes to confirm the position i have maintained on behalf of the presidency of the european union .
whether or not there was ballot-rigging is not in question .
it says in my report - and i said so in my speech - that the elections were marked by widespread and general ballot-rigging , and voting and counting irregularities .
our problem is not to decide whether the elections were properly conducted or not , because i do not think they were properly conducted .
the problem is to find the most effective and appropriate strategy now to end this crisis .
i do not want us to be judges as well as politicians .
it is not up to us to pass sentence , it is up to us to find a solution to a very serious crisis .
i think it would be legitimate to say that the best thing to do is re-run the whole election , but the question is how do we get a decision to re-run the election ?
that is the real question !
it is not enough for us to say that the election must be re-run .
when i spoke of political dialogue i was not using that formula to suggest a generic methodological formula valid for all occasions and all political situations .
no !
and personally i think one of the things to be discussed in this setting is precisely whether it is possible to agree a re-run of the election .
but the political problem is not just to form judgements or set up objectives , it is primarily to establish the route to certain objectives .
i do not think it is our role to minimize criticism of this election but , at the same time , we must implement effective and necessary strategies to help overcome this crisis .
so i think it is important to see what happens in the next few days .
mr president , since mr oostlander has addressed himself to the commission i should like to mention one or two points in answer .
those are two pieces of information which i wanted to give , but i should like to end with a general political reflection .
there must naturally be no doubt at all that the further development of relations between albania and the european union depends essentially and crucially upon the quality of the democratic process .
it must be made clear to albania that naturally the european union cannot go further with that project unless that distorted situation which now undoubtedly exists is set democratically to rights in one way or another .
the debate is closed .
common transport policy - action programme 1995-2000
madam president , i would like to thank the members of my group , union for europe , for giving me two minutes more than i was allocated so that i can explain this report more fully .
the progress europe has achieved throughout its history has been founded on the quality and extent of its communications networks .
transport demand has experienced virtually uninterrupted growth since the 1970s ; with the creation of the single market and the free movement of persons and goods , it is destined to grow even more .
without an efficient , accessible and competitive transport system , the european union as a whole will be unable to pursue its social and economic development in a harmonious and balanced manner .
in short , the basic aims of the european union will be unattainable .
thirdly , it deals with reducing traffic congestion , particularly for road traffic , and alternative means of access and mobility in the urban areas , where better public transport is a very high priority .
fourthly , there is a need to develop a genuine transport culture , promoting educational programmes in schools on the use of means of transport , safety and respect for the rules .
i think this report represents a firm and precise starting point for the future of transport .
actually it is a report about major harmonization of the infrastructure of our european union , about priority political choices , rules and conduct in the area of transport .
madam president the objectives of this action programme must be to offer basic mobility to all citizens without damaging nature and the environment .
from this definition it is clear that our current transport policies are unsustainable and need a radical shift in direction .
yet this communication adopts a business-asusual approach , regardless of the dangers of current trends .
the environment committee is particularly concerned about the impact of road transport on the environment .
at present , cars and lorries are responsible for about a quarter of the european union 's co2 emissions .
clearly what is needed are eu-wide targets for the reduction of co2 emissions in the transport sector .
to be fair , the commission does talk about the necessary shift of traffic from the roads .
but integrating the environment into transport policy must be more consistent and more focused .
principles already in place , like the polluter-pays and precautionary principles must be part of all transport legislation .
one way to ensure such integration could be to annex an environmental impact sheet to all new transport proposals outlining what environmental problems are at stake and what actions can be taken to solve them .
all the commission has for the period 1997-2000 in this action programme are three proposals on air transport and one on maritime transport .
this neglects the fact that the impact of road transport on the environment is one of the most serious problems being faced by the european union and it will get worse if nothing is done .
however , the planned environment proposals are very welcome , as are the recently published green papers on the citizens ' network and the internalization of external costs .
the latter proposal , in particular , should make it possible for less polluting forms of transport to compete on a more equal footing with polluting ones .
radical and far-sighted policies are urgently needed in this sector and unfortunately there are not too many signs of those in this communication .
my committee therefore gives it qualified support .
madam president , on behalf of the committee on budgets , may i express our gratification that the proposals made by the committee on budgets are reflected in the present resolution .
we welcome parliament 's endorsement of the 14 priorities , because the trans-european networks naturally have two key functions .
first of all , the commission believes - and we agree - that they are an important aspect of employment policy .
secondly , they should help to reinforce europe 's appeal as a business location .
so it is important that we concentrate on these and do not dissipate our energies .
the second thing i welcome as an austrian is the plan to extend the envisaged high-speed paris-munich rail link to vienna .
we think , however , that it will be desirable to make a more specific approach with the inclusion of a comprehensive statistical background which in our opinion is inadequate .
as regards the financing of the trans-european transport networks , its importance is universally recognized by us all . the networks are an essential feature of the realization of the internal market .
their impact on employment and the social problems with which we contend every day are taking on a decisive importance .
as regards the internalization of external costs , that is , in our opinion a matter of high priority .
the ideas outlined in the green paper on this subject show clearly what possibilities there are and they must be followed by concrete measures at the appropriate levels as soon as possible .
madam president , i will concentrate on social aspects of this report .
like the previous speakers , our committee is very concerned about the very cautious nature of the report , which was not wide-ranging enough taking into consideration that the common transport policy is very important for the union .
we are particularly concerned about working time and how it affects the transport sector .
that was a long time ago , in fact it was 18 months ago mr flynn first promised us this .
he promised us it about january 1995 and we are now in june 1996 .
our committee now feel that it is time that the commission galvanizes us into action in this area .
we are also concerned about the tens which other people have mentioned .
we are worried about the fact that the edinburgh facility , the economic investment fund that was established in edinburgh , has remained a dead letter .
this has impeded transport development , particularly infrastructure development schemes such as the west coast line in the united kingdom and the electrified line into glasgow airport .
many of the other good ferry services we could have linking cross- channel states of the community have remained another dead letter because there has been no funding .
it is important that the commission put some pressure on the council to ensure there is adequate funding in this area of infrastructure .
transport is very important for the european union , to make sure that there is genuine freedom of movement and people and goods can go freely about the union .
the best way to do that is by good transport links .
but we also have considerable deficits .
i shall try to focus again on something my honourable friend mr mcmahon mentioned in passing in the opinion he drafted for the committee on social affairs and employment .
we expect the relationship between harmonization and liberalization , which is still out of balance , to be kept under constant review .
i intend to emphasize very clearly at every opportunity that our pleas to this effect should be addressed primarily to the council rather than the commission .
we do , however , ask the commission for its continued support in this matter .
our social standards are still not safeguarded ; indeed , social standards are slipping , are constantly being forced downward .
we need consultations ; we need the development of consultative mechanisms so that management and labour can come up with effective legislative solutions .
the results of these discussions will naturally be fed into the preparatory phase , as well as into the agenda itself , of the third pan-european transport conference , due to take place in helsinki in 1997 .
it is a good basis .
safety problems and the quest for environmentally acceptable solutions are actually a matter for all transport operators .
i touched briefly on external relations , and i should like to add something to that .
i consider it very important that the commission should be given mandates to represent the european union in negotiations with third countries on transport matters and that this should be done more quickly than has hitherto been the case .
in particular , of course , i am thinking of air transport negotiations with the united states , for which i was appointed rapporteur .
wherever possible , then , we want to move away very rapidly from these bilateral structures and to see the commission sit down much sooner at the negotiating table to look after the interests of the entire european union .
our honourable colleague mr k&ouml;nig referred to the trans-european networks .
mr k&ouml;nig , we have made far less progress in this area than you seemed to suggest .
another meeting of the conciliation committee is currently taking place between delegations from parliament and the council .
the council has scarcely budged , and at the moment the whole scheme is tending to look like a dead letter .
i should very much regret that , but the council has to realize that there are powers of codecision involved here ; it has evidently not understood that yet .
but over and above the 14 projects , which we in parliament certainly support , we wish to have an additional list of priority projects .
going beyond the work of the conciliation committee , we naturally also want to develop a financial basis at long last .
on that we are agreed .
one of the problems at the moment is the siege mentality adopted by the council .
the further development of a transport policy for the whole of europe is being curbed rather than encouraged by the council .
without parliament and the commission the situation would indeed be bleak !
we require investments totalling hundreds of billions , but only a ludicrous few hundred million ecus are earmarked in our european budget .
so we must continue to assume that these tasks will primarily be undertaken by the member states .
mr parodi 's report marks an important step in the series of reports on this subject and in the ongoing development of a pan-european transport policy .
in relation to sea transport , i would like to draw my colleagues ' attention to the request that we take positive measures to promote the european fleet , including the setting up of the euros register .
i would also urge that the action programme take in those measures to enhance ferry safety , allowing landbased infrastructures for satellite systems enabling a rapid response when vessels run into difficulty .
this would enable vessels to enter a harbour to find a safe haven and would strengthen port-state and flag-state control and the designation , where appropriate , of sensitive areas .
in the field of railways , we would like to see a better development of the european railways .
we call specifically for the railway market to be opened up to new , private railway companies , thereby enhancing consumer choice .
turning to safety and the fitting of seat belts , we would emphasize especially the importance of fitting threepoint seat belts on coaches and buses , as well as roll-over bars on coaches and mini-buses .
in the field of air transport , it is particularly important to have a unified system of air traffic control .
we should bring to an end state aids to airlines and particularly call on commissioner van miert to insist on the one-time , last-time principle being applied to state aids in the airline industry .
in paragraph 56 , we believe that the rapporteur meant to push for an external relations policy for air transport and i hope that he can support our amendment along those lines .
as other speakers have mentioned , we support the tens enabling a greater use of public and private partnerships and an imaginative approach to financing such schemes .
we in the european people 's party commend the report to the house , we congratulate the rapporteur and thank the commission for this initiative .
it is consistent with the past , as mr l&uuml;ttge has reminded us , but i think it also projects the new paths for the future .
from the many stimuli it offers , i choose one , the one the rapporteur placed , perhaps not deliberately , at the end of his own presentation : finance .
carrying out projects is fine and exciting , but how can that be done without the necessary funds ?
there are already grounds for satisfaction about the approach to the project in the preamble , but there is also concern because it stands on feet of clay .
in other words only 0.85 % of the funds described as indispensable is being provided .
the european citizen can hardly fail to be a little confused when presented with promises impossible to keep .
that is why the commission , parliament and the council must make it clear how the money will be found and how the famous partnership , claimed as the definitive answer , is going to be constructed .
i remember commissioner kinnock telling us one day to convince our citizens that participating in the creation of these networks is a bargain .
well , i think we need to look at this invitation again with great realism and great honesty , and first set ourselves definite , clear and transparent guidelines .
madam president , i am a little disappointed in both the commission action programme and the report .
there are a few things left out of the commission 's action programme .
i think the association with environment policy is incomplete and in addition where security for example is concerned i think the response to the security problems on road transport and also on air transport does not go far enough .
where the environment is concerned i cannot find even a reference to the aims of co2 reduction as the european institutions themselves have previously laid them down .
how can you maintain now that you are trying to create a sustainable mobility if in an action programme like this you do not even refer to aims of that kind and indicate how they must be achieved .
mr parodi 's report touches upon it but unfortunately the report has become so convoluted , such a long string of demands and wishes that we can no longer pick out the priorities .
that is a very great pity because then it cannot be seen just where parliament 's main criticisms of this action programme lie .
madam president , the commission 's action programme is so general and comprehensive that there is little in it with which i can disagree .
that is the strength , but also the weakness , of this document .
too many general statements with very little commitment and too few specific priorities .
admittedly the problems of transport are complex and very diverse .
in all fields of policy numerous legitimate aspirations need to be expressed , but that must not prevent priority choices being made or some parameters being drawn .
the parodi report rightly mentions this .
so after the pan-european transport conference in helsinki next year the commission will have to draw up a new action programme and lay down clearer priorities .
in that connection i should like to point out three areas for attention .
in the first place the enlargement of the union which will result. we expect , in a great increase in traffic .
the union must address itself to that as a priority in collaboration with the countries of central and eastern europe .
secondly , with a view to the enlargement and because of the increasing traffic within the union itself , the proportion of transport by rail and water must be considerably increased .
inland navigation , coast-wise trade and rail will have to acquire a much stronger market position .
measures for discouraging goods and passenger transport by road including the charging of external costs are insufficient where there is no good alternative .
opening up the railway market and continuing construction of the trans-european networks are therefore necessary .
thirdly , in view of the strong growth of air transport the union will have to do its best to arrange taxation of aircraft fuel on a world scale .
finally mr parodi is to be congratulated on the extensive piece of work he has put before us .
i am afraid , however , that there is a risk that sight will again be lost of the priorities since the report is so extensive and so complete .
madam president , in its communication on the common transport policy action programme for 1995-2000 the commission has certainly heralded a step towards a comprehensive transport policy strategy .
the concentration on four lines of action is indicative of the desire to take an integrated approach to transport legislation .
what makes this all the more gratifying is that members who serve on the competent parliamentary committee sometimes feel they are dealing with a motley assortment of unconnected legislative bills .
transport , and this can never be repeated too often , cannot be compartmentalized into separate modes .
it must always be seen in its entirety and subordinated to overriding strategic aims , such as the reduction of environmental pollution .
these remarks assume particular significance if we look at the social dimension and the question of working hours .
each of us knows that compliance with legally prescribed driving and rest periods is patchy .
this not only harms and endangers the drivers in question but also involves constant subsidization of an environmentally detrimental form of transport .
the legal remedies available to us at european level appear modest when compared with the powers available under classic competition law and with those vested in directorategeneral vi .
the communication from the commission envisages the line of action entitled ' taking account of the social dimension ' as amounting only to continued consultation of management and labour .
however , to rebuke the commissioner for such inadequacies is to miss the point , for the real problem is that the member states are continuing to hide behind the mask of subsidiarity .
but the consequences of this policy - or , to be more precise , this lack of policy - affect the whole internal market and distort competition between modes of transport .
and so in conclusion i wish to voice my doubts as to whether the commission can ever achieve the aim it has formulated in the white paper by environmentally compatible means .
madam president , in many respects the report which we are currently debating is a positive document which takes the offensive .
it is necessary if we are to solve europe 's traffic problems in the future , not least in view of the extensive enlargement process which lies ahead .
we also therefore have reason to be thankful to the rapporteur , mr parodi , for the work he has done .
one major challenge still faces us , however , and that is to find an appropriate way of combining increased traffic with a better environment .
the un has declared today world environment day .
this debate and the decision we are about to take should reflect this fact .
the environment is the biggest issue facing mankind as we approach the next millennium .
nothing can be more important for us than to solve the environment 's various problems .
road transport is indisputably to blame for many of the different problems affecting the environment .
in several countries the only effect this is having is to ensure that nobody can afford to buy new , more environmentally friendly cars .
as a result the cars in circulation are simply getting older and older as time goes by - and from the environmental point of view , worse and worse .
this is nevertheless the policy we are pursuing in a great many countries today .
this assumes that we have the courage to establish the objective and formulate the requirement that in the future cars will be powered by something other than today 's internal combustion engine .
it will presumably be battery power or some form of hybrid engine which will have to be made available commercially instead .
this in turn presupposes purposeful research to enable the various problems to be solved .
what we really need today is to direct all action towards a time when the problems will have been solved .
if we allow the european motor industry to gear itself to this and also make available the necessary resources for research , i am convinced that this will work .
it would , madam president , be one of the best investments we could make for the next generation .
it should also be mentioned in this context that it is absolutely essential to secure pan-european funding as soon as possible for the brenner tunnel and its feeder lines .
the three participating countries - austria , germany and italy - cannot raise this money alone .
the stoicism of the people living in this part of the alps has limits that must not go on being transgressed indefinitely .
the realization of the brenner tunnel project in particular will not only mean economic and ecological progress for the directly affected regions but will be of enormous benefit to the entire union .
madam president , i would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on a fine report .
the trans-european networks are certainly extremely important to the future of the european union , especially to peripheral areas of that union , and i want to deal with that in more detail in my speech here this evening .
good infrastructure within the european union is important and air and sea links are imperative .
in northern ireland we totally depend on the links from our ports to the mainland of the united kingdom .
all our imports and our exports depend on an efficient roll-on , roll-off infrastructure .
sea transport is our road and bridge to mainland united kingdom and further to mainland continental europe .
we must not be disenfranchised by unfair support to other parts of the european union and to other member states through cohesion fund support , as is happening at the moment .
i welcome the inclusion of seat-belts because this is a very necessary safety measure for buses and coaches within the european union .
when we speak of harmonisation of fuel and vehicle taxes , i have some concern .
i believe we must have a level playing field but we must harmonise at a realistic level .
flags of convenience in our shipping industry have haunted us for years and we have never achieved a solution .
this is a very serious problem and it will not disappear .
we have not been prepared to date to face up to the consequences of increased safety on our sea routes .
finally , i welcome the fact that mr van miert is the commissioner here this evening .
many years ago , when he had the responsibility for transport , i led a deputation of westminster mps to see him .
when we arrived at his office it was found that northern ireland did not even exist .
there were no links from northern ireland to mainland united kingdom and europe .
i would like to play tribute to him tonight because after our visit to him , he ensured that we had links from belfast and larne and the other ports .
i am very grateful to him for that and i have no doubt the commission will continue to pay heed to the necessity and the importance for northern ireland of these links .
but let me start by sincerely congratulating mr parodi and the committee on transport and other committees which have collaborated in this report on the commission 's action programme .
it has become a very extensive document which demonstrates the thoroughness with which not only the rapporteur but also other members both in the committee on transport and other committees of parliament have studied the commission 's programme .
the report , then , contains a wealth of useful suggestions and constructive criticisms which the commission will naturally take into account in its deliberations .
i must of course point out that not all objectives can be realized in the short term and that the development of the community transport policy is a long-term operation .
moreover we know from experience that at one time parliament itself had to go to the court of justice to get things moving .
since then we have certainly been able to achieve something , but the momentum which we had seven or eight years ago seems today unfortunately to have been rather lost .
inevitably it is impossible within the compass of this short debate here to go into each separate suggestion , observation or criticism in mr parodi 's report .
the action programme was set up in accordance with an endeavour by both parliament and the council to set up a multiannual legislative framework programme for transport .
that endeavour was in turn a result of the discussions on the 1992 commission white paper on the future development of the community transport policy .
as you know , that was the period for which i still had some responsibility .
you will still remember that a very interesting report on the subject was drawn up by mr porrazzini .
in setting up the action programme the commission 's intention is simply to present a number of possible actions .
the parameters for the policy and strategy were in fact already laid down in the white paper .
it is true that the main areas of our activity are sketched out in greater detail in the action programme for the sake of clarity .
i have noticed that too in most meetings ; actually we are not so far apart .
it is more a matter of appreciation , of emphasis .
it seems to us impossible to discuss further in the framework of this debate all questions noted in the report .
i should like to refer to various points made , but unfortunately we do not have the time .
so i shall be very brief , but there are individual points which must be mentioned .
that is naturally a serious message from parliament but i should like to ask you and urge you to preserve some sense of reality , we cannot go on piling up reports and programmes .
we must also try to be practical and to move ahead .
the report also repeats the idea , long held within parliament , that our general policy and our specific proposals must be based on a better statistical foundation .
naturally we agree , but you know how hard it is to get reliable material from the various member states .
in some sectors the position is better .
i am thinking amongst other things of sea and air transport , and as that material becomes available it will naturally be used by the commission .
then i should like to make an observation or a reflection with regard to various critical asides on the social and employment aspects of transport policy .
but unfortunately we have had to recognize that on that plane too the willingness of the council of ministers and a number of governments was minimal .
may i remind you that years ago the commission took the initiative of trying to harmonize flying time and rest time for pilots , but we came back empty-handed .
but unfortunately that too is a long time ago .
we should have been able to do a great deal more if only we had had the necessary budgetary resources put at our disposal to support specific projects .
but we must keep hammering away at it .
naturally the position is the same with the trans-european networks .
here i assume that no-one in this parliament can reproach the commission with not making the necessary efforts .
here too moreover i should like to sing parliament 's praises .
that was how we received our first funds .
parliament together with the commission have always had to fight the council to get the money needed .
with the prospect of the summit meeting of the european council at florence you know how hard the commission and its president in particular will be hammering that point home again .
i can only express the hope that mad cow disease will not put a spoke in the wheel again to delay the matter for us once again .
i should like to conclude with that , ladies and gentlemen .
certainly there would be other things to say , but i think i can leave it at that .
i should like to thank all those who have spoken for their contribution , and once more , on behalf of neil kinnock , i should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .

driving licences
mr president , this directive can be summarized in a few words .
at first reading , the european parliament approved the commission proposal of 16 january 1995 on the alternative plastic credit card model driving licence , making eight amendments .
at the request of the holder , this new heading could also contain information not connected with the licence , like blood group , willingness to donate organs , holder 's nationality , etcetera .
the scheduled date of entry into force of the directive remains 1 july 1996 .
in substance , the council has accepted three of the european parliament 's eight first reading amendments .
the rapporteur is therefore proposing not only to retable some of the amendments from the first reading , but also to alter some passages where the council has changed the initial proposal .
amendment no 2 makes it compulsory again to mention the member state issuing the licence , which the council felt should be optional .
amendment no 3 merely slims down the council 's proposal by removing the first part .
finally , amendment no 4 reinstates the prohibition against member states adding taxes to the licence fee .
mr president , the proposal to introduce a european driving licence in the form of a plastic card of credit-card dimensions is basically a sensible and practical idea for all concerned .
the licence card is actually intended to facilitate the free movement of european citizens and to promote the mutual recognition of driving licences .
but after examining the council 's common position , i cannot help thinking that the council wants to take systematic action to prevent any progress towards a stronger common identity within the european union .
almost every article contains one of the words optional and non-compulsory .
these words , though quite innocuous in themselves , nevertheless mean that it is being left to the discretion of each member state to do what it wants when it wants .
a directive , however , is meant to establish the framework for a national law , and such a framework should not be turned into an elasticated stretch cover by means of the words optional and non-compulsory .
the common position is indeed a prime example of the council 's inability to arrive at proper joint decisions .
only when it comes to disregarding the proposals of parliament does the council seem able to draw on vast reserves of solidarity .
the commission 's proposal for the optional - and i emphasize optional - incorporation of a microchip into the card was also rejected and has been replaced by a new space on the card .
the basis of the proposal for the credit-card model , however , was the potential controlled use of future information technology .
through its decision the council has now brought more bureaucracy and expenditure upon itself , because once the conditions for the introduction of the microchips have been negotiated , the new driving licences will have to be exchanged again .
strangely enough , the council , and above all the german minister of transport , had rejected ten-year validity in favour of unrestricted validity with a view to saving time and money .
i wonder how mutual recognition is meant to work in europe on this basis .
the problem must be resolved , even if we have to wait until an action for discrimination is brought before the european court of justice .
i take the view that the term ' european driving licence ' is a case of fraudulent misrepresentation .
the committee on transport and tourism has adopted four amendments for the second reading .
my group will support them .
the directive , as we know , is due to enter into force on the first of july this year .
its stated intention is to wait until the plastic card is introduced .
first of all , such a document offers the basis for national driving licences that are comprehensible and recognized throughout europe , which means greater security for licence-holders .
secondly , it facilitates any spot-checks that may be necessary and thereby enhances road safety .
thirdly , it guarantees greater flexibility of use while reducing the risk of licence forgery .
fourthly , it satisfies the desire of many people nowadays for effectiveness and efficiency and for practicality and flexibility in the use of things and in dealings with authorities and institutions .
that is precisely why i expect many member states to take the opportunity to introduce this type of model driving licence as quickly as possible , even though it is unfortunately not compulsory .
i should like to congratulate the council on its decision to side with parliament in opposing the commission proposal to limit the validity of the licence to ten years .
this decision gives user states the chance to decide themselves on the term of validity of the driving licence , which , though drawn up in accordance with the eu model , is still a national licence .
at the same time , the group of the european people 's party not only favours a far longer term but actually supports unlimited validity .
this would help to save money and to minimize bureaucracy .
the introduction of a separate space in which the issuing country may make optional entries is in line with the wishes of parliament .
the option of including bar codes and national symbols - which , of course , must not impair comprehensibility and mutual recognition - accords with the legitimate interests of the member states .
let us hope that this also contributes to speedy implementation .
i propose that we support mr farassino and his report .
mr president , we have to be strict about not allowing member states to collect tax on driving licences annually .
i also support mr farassino in urging that a reference to the flexible use of driving licences and to the prevention of forgery should be included in the directive .
it would also be sensible to include information on the driving licence about consent for organ donation .
i failed completely to understand why a centralized monitoring system in the form of a register of penalty points should be introduced in connection with driving licences .
restricting the duration of licences to ten years would also increase bureaucracy unnecessarily .
the requirement laid down in the directive that lorry drivers who wear glasses should lose their licence after 1 july has caused great amazement among the finns .
the wearing of glasses or contact lenses with a strength of + / -4 does not in any way hinder their driving .
there are proportionally more long-sighted people working as professional drivers than in any other profession .
i would like to ask the commissioner how this error will be rectified .
parliament will have to request immediate negotiations between the bodies concerned in order to correct the directive in this respect .
mr president , with the prospect of more people moving around the european union more freely , my group and i welcome the harmonisation of driving licences .
this proposal from the commission , with the sensible amendments from the rapporteur , will take the harmonisation process forward by requiring a common code system for conditions under which any driver is authorised to use a vehicle .
in the european union we have already had mutual recognition of driving licences for some time now .
but that has not meant that every police officer in every member state inspecting those licences fully understands what is communicated or written on them .
the new licences will make certain that police officers will be able in the future to appreciate and understand the information contained in them .
the driving licences are certainly going to be of value to road safety .
they will certainly enhance the feeling of the right of movement by eu citizens and they will also certainly benefit disabled drivers .
the licence also contains a micro-chip and it is this that has caused the greatest debate among the members .
as well as codifying conditions under which the owner can drive , the micro-chip could store useful information as suggested already concerning the willingness to donate organs , as well as medical requirements and needs of the driver himself .
i can understand and appreciate the fear that might be felt among certain people that this card would develop into an id card , via the back door .
to offset that danger , the rapporteur and the commission have agreed to a special committee , which will examine the confidentiality and security implications of the micro-chip .
in the meantime , i certainly welcome the rapporteur 's report with the hope that the commission will give that report their full support .
i also look forward to more people , even from the island of the united kingdom who have the habit of driving on the wrong side of the road , driving even further on the continent of europe .
so let us regard this proposal as a first step in the right direction , though not perhaps the last .
but driving licences are also part of our citizens ' everyday lives .
we therefore hope that all the member states will agree on a sound compromise between data protection and the sort of information that contributes to safety in general as well as to the safety of the individual .
it does seem to me , however , that the most important of the amendments is the fourth , the aim of which is to outlaw the imposition of annual taxes on driving licences .
if this amendment is not accepted , we run the risk of seeing the european driving licence pressed into service as a means of levying new vehicle taxes , which could also vary between countries .
the beneficial effect of the introduction of a european driving licence would , in my opinion , be completely overshadowed by these disadvantages .
that is why we also support mr farassino 's proposal , and we hope that he will obtain a majority here in the house for all his amendments .
mr president , despite the unresolved issues , i believe that we can generally be satisfied with the work done on this directive .
the commission , with its credit-card model , has put forward a foresighted proposal .
it represents a successful compromise between harmonization and respect for the specific characteristics of our member states .
every citizen of the eu who lives for more than three months in another member state will come to appreciate the advantages offered by this directive .
and from a parliamentary point of view , we too can take pleasure in the fact that some of the results of our work are reflected in the common position .
licence-holders who so wish , for example , will now be able to have their blood group and allergies entered on request and make a voluntary undertaking to donate organs .
anyone who remembers the first reading here in the house will know that even this dictate of common sense did not pass unchallenged by some members .
but let us hope that today at least we shall make the rapid administration of first aid our prime concern rather than exploiting the all-too-serious subject of data protection for the purpose of panicmongering .
mr president , let us begin by heartily congratulating the rapporteur , mr farassino , on his report .
naturally it is not the first time this matter has been discussed here in parliament , but we are in fact close to taking a further step in the right direction .
as a result of that rule the driving licence can even be used as an identity card , but only , i repeat , if the holder agrees .
i would point out too that in the common position it is expressly stated that these additions can in no way make any alteration to the use of the new model as a driving licence .
as honourable members are aware , special space is to be reserved on the card with a view to the possible introduction in the future of a microchip or similar computer device .
the commission intends to set up a working group to study this question and in the light of its conclusions we shall consider whether or not to make a formal proposal .
i hope that as a result the disquiet expressed amongst other things by many members at first reading will be allayed .
another contentious point in the discussion was the length of validity of the card , which the commission had proposed as ten years .
like a small majority in parliament i regret that the council has unanimously removed that provision .
but i thank parliament for giving the commission its support at first reading .
as regards the amendments tabled for this second reading , i must inform honourable members that the commission cannot entertain them .
three of the four amendments proposed by the committee on transport are identical to those already made at first reading , when the commission said that it could not accept them .
the commission also explained the reasons on that occasion and i am quite ready to do that again briefly .
a member state will in any case have to be mentioned since the initial for the country must be printed on one side of the card .
amendment no 3 aims at deleting the words ' european communities model ' on the licence .
however , the position is that mutual recognition of driving licences is ensured by those words . for that reason we cannot accept that amendment either .
the subject of amendment no 4 , namely cost of issue , falls , as members know , exclusively within the province of the member states .
unfortunately no other answer can be given to the honourable member who spoke more particularly on that point .
that will be dealt with later , but all in good time .
in conclusion i should like once again to thank mr farassino and his colleagues from the committee on transport .
i hope that the whole matter will now be settled quickly even though honourable members still put a question-mark in here and there .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
inland waterway transport
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a council regulation on my report relates to the free provision of services in the transport of goods or passengers .
the intention is to create a legal guarantee of free access by transport undertakings in the community member states to inland waterway transport .
the commission considers that , since austria joined the union , a new arrangement is required .
this is because austria has concluded bilateral agreements with germany and the netherlands . they make access to the international inland waterway transport market more difficult for carriers in that sector who are based in other member states .
these bilateral agreements are therefore incompatible with the principle of the free provision of services .
not only that , but they imply a discrimination based on nationality .
austria 's membership of the european union thus offers an opportunity to do so .
the initial commission proposal was adopted unamended by parliament on first reading .
i fully endorse this proposal .
and , once again , i thank the rapporteur and parliament for their solid support .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
green paper on innovation
we in this house have debated the questions of competitiveness , development and employment on very many occasions , but only rarely have we focused on the importance of innovation in the pursuit of those three objectives .
in order to be relevant and effective , the research and technological development policy of the european union should not , i believe , seek to define technological priorities for industries that operate in rapidly changing global markets .
nor should it become a form of hidden state aid for sectors that cannot effectively compete in such markets .
the innovation process is more complicated than that , and we in the european union should ask ourselves whether the existing research and development policies and structures are based on an up-to-date understanding of the subject .
and therefore a strategy focusing on the dissemination of research results must support research that is inter-disciplinary , application-orientated and network-driven .
it must develop regional networks of non-industrial and industrial institutions and elaborate visible aims to help society understand the research and technology process and to become involved .
in that context , three routes of action in the commission 's proposal deserve special mention .
secondly , the furthering of the mobility of researchers as an important means of diffusion of innovation via the strengthening of links between the innovation programme and activity four of the fourth framework programme .
this route of action must include more industrial research laboratories in its fourth activity .
yet the investment structure with regard to the fostering of innovation in the european union is so underdeveloped that the subject is an important public policy issue .
one of europe 's main weaknesses , in fact , lies in a failure to translate technological research results and technical know-how into commercial success , chiefly because of the ineffectiveness of the financing system .
by establishing a more effective structure the innovation programme does help , but there is a manifest need for more concerted and systematic action by the commission to improve the financing sector .
without things of that sort i think that the union will fail in its activities .
and i believe that the effectiveness of the union 's research and technology policy demands the promotion of collaboration and coordination via integrated strategic diffusion of the results of research and technological development .
i would like to begin by congratulating mr argyros on this excellent report and the work he has put into it .
it is a credit to this house .
millions of years ago the dinosaurs died out because they could not adapt fast enough to a changing world .
today the same fate faces european industry if we cannot make change our ally .
innovation is the lifeblood of the new global economy and our only hope for survival in a hostile economic environment .
but the picture painted by the european commission is none too bright .
clearly the european union lags behind its major competitors in almost every field ; research and development , the dissemination of information , attitudes to training , the business environment and so on .
the picture is made bleaker still by the attitude of member states such as my own where innovation is sacrificed on the altar of short-termism .
a lack of long-term planning and an obsession with dividend payouts to shareholders mean that innovation is left a long way down the list of priorities .
europe 's role in curing this disease is strictly limited but that is why we have to make sure that what we do , we do well .
above all , we have to bridge the gulf between business and science , not only in terms of disseminating information but in building a working partnership between innovators and industry .
the two are not chalk and cheese . they should be flip sides of the same coin .
making this a reality begins at the most basic level .
these are the foundations for an innovation-based society and industry .
the commission 's proposals and the recommendations in this report could kick-start this process .
in particular , through the creation of a sectoral taskforce , they provide a basis for bringing science and industry together in a goal-driven team .
they also mark a move away from the old subsidy-based approach .
our task must be to make sure that the member states show equal determination to fulfil their part of the bargain .
action in europe is no excuse for complacency at home .
mr president , i would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur , mr argyros , for an altogether excellent report and for the fact that he paid considerable attention to the viewpoints of the social affairs committee .
i shall restrict myself to the social issues .
the relationship between society and innovation is a symbiotic one .
on the one hand , the way a society is organised plays a major role in determining whether innovations come into being at all .
on the other , innovations can in themselves change society .
this is the way it has always been .
they can also play a significant role in the future too .
i am often asked whether innovation will create new jobs .
i usually answer that it depends on whether one takes the short-term or the long-term view , whether one sees the issue in its narrowest sense or more broadly .
narrowly speaking , and in the short term , innovation in a limited field can of course result in fewer jobs .
however , history shows that societies which have been open to innovation have always been the most competitive societies , societies which have been able to carry on and create new jobs .
i am therefore convinced that a society which favours innovation also creates jobs .
finally , a word about business and employees . it is sometimes said that employees and co-determination for employees are a burden on industry .
where innovation is concerned this is definitely not the case .
in companies where employees have considerable influence and co-determination is important it is much easier to foster attitudes which are favourable to the implementation of innovations .
this is why co-determination and employee participation is incredibly important in a society which seeks to be innovative .
mr president , we have to face the fact that the community 's competitive position in relation to japan and the united states is going backwards and not forwards .
we must also face the fact that the evidence is clear that it is not a failure in research which is the problem but the failure to apply the research to products and processes .
this is not an assessment which is new to us on the committee on research , technological development and energy .
we have been aware of this for some time and , indeed , we can claim that it was at the insistence of parliament that the innovation part of the framework programme has been increasingly important in recent years .
in fact , as we know , within the current fourth programme innovation is a fully-fledged programme in its own right .
the commission 's green paper is a welcome document .
it recognizes the need for some new thinking to encourage the innovation processes .
proposals for action at community level are now awaited from the consultation process which the green paper has initiated .
i wish to congratulate the rapporteur , mr argyros , on the quality of his report and the very strong efforts he made to take into account fully the opinions of other committees , as mr andersson has acknowledged .
the rapporteur subsequently went to the bother of tightening up the resolution to make it much more focused and that was unanimously approved by our committee .
because of this the socialist group fully agrees with the resolution and we will vote against any amendments .
over the years community research has created a great reservoir of ideas .
the task now is to ensure that this knowledge reaches every manufacturing and service business .
production processes and services activities have to be broken down into their components and analysed for methods of improvement .
that is the culture we have to encourage .
it is truly a formidable challenge to the concept of the information society .
actions at community level will be useless unless there is a strong link with regional and local technology and innovation centres .
member states have a key responsibility to promote these centres and , where appropriate , the structural and cohesion funds of the community should be used in support .
the big idea concept will not solve our problems . a multitude of small applications probably will .
in backing this report , the socialist group calls on the commission to incorporate the ideas which have been expressed in the resolution and in the explanatory statement into the action plan which we await with keen interest .
this problem is currently the main concern of the european union .
jobs will only ever be secure if we establish ourselves in a leading position in the technologies of tomorrow .
in this respect , i believe that three particularly important points are made in the green paper .
first of all , there is the dissemination and exploitation of research results .
in addition , it is naturally essential that research findings should be presented in an informative and intelligible manner to the general public and that a technology culture should be promoted .
at the same time , i am aware that these two efforts cannot be centrally directed but must come from below , so to speak , beginning in school .
secondly , in the european union we have 15 research policies , many of which are formulated in isolation .
if our innovative capacity is to be enhanced , closer cooperation at national and union levels is necessary .
this necessary competition is not simply a matter of duplicated effort at twice the cost but also releases creativity and ideas for the future , and they are just what we need !
coming now to the commission 's green paper , i note that it contains much valid analysis and thought : some traditional , some innovative .
i recognize the potential of this approach and i am sure we will continue the debate and exchange of views with commissioner cresson when it comes to refinancing the fourth framework programme .
for the moment , we approve and encourage the commission 's efforts in the green paper .
but novelty should not deter us from taking the most traditional , familiar and yet necessary measures : development of a european capital market for small firms , simplification of administrative formalities , researcher mobility .
the most important message of the green paper is that the commission , like a number of member states , is extending technological policy into innovation policy .
in itself it is a readable document with a good analysis and lines of action which seem likely to be effective .
the headpiece put on it with the task force is rather incomprehensible to the liberal group .
close coordination of research efforts is necessary . but that must not entail covert sector support .
for liberals that is something akin to swearing in church .
the development of generic technologies useful for many sectors can actually increase the competitive capacity of the whole european union .
secondly , the distribution of powers between national authorities and the european authority according to line of action is arguable .
innovation policy including technology policy needs to be developed and implemented at national level unless the extent of the problem or of the scale is of such a nature as to require an approach at european level .
innovation policy for the small and medium-sized businesses seems to be pre-eminently a task for the national authorities .
besides , small- and medium-sized businesses are not a homogeneous group of undertakings but an extremely diverse group .
a different approach according to the target group is desirable .
so i am glad that my amendment on that has been taken up .
from various enquiries it seems that with small- and medium-sized businesses one working year 's research and development provides twice as many innovations as in big business .
but the number of innovations successfully introduced on to the market is pitifully small .
the percentage of success for europe as a whole is only 20 % .
that is primarily due to strong selectivity on the technological sides of innovation and insufficient attention to market aspects .
my group hopes that a fundamentally different approach to the problems of innovation will lead to a new and effective policy with , as its aim , wide scope for innovative firms and new opportunities for employment .
innovations obviously have a positive impact in many ways , but not necessarily a positive social impact .
innovations can help to create new jobs and entire industries , but the opposite can also be the case . research into the social impact of innovations should therefore form a part of innovation policy .
an increase in production efficiency as a result of innovations should also be beneficial to employees , for example by leading to shorter working hours and a redistribution of tasks .
it is also important to emphasize , as the committee has done , that only in organizations with well-developed communication producers and high levels of employee participation can the opportunities provided by innovations be exploited effectively .
mr president , i should like to begin by thanking mr argyros for a very good report , which i largely support .
i have nevertheless tabled three amendments , as i believe there are a number of things mr argyros has forgotten .
my first amendment concerns environmental taxes .
these are three areas in which the member states of the eu today lack proper innovation which would help them cope with environmental problems , growth and unemployment .
the union should not risk falling behind on these important issues because of a fear of innovation and change .
it is also absolutely essential that risk capital should be made available for innovators .
i propose that the nasdaq model should be used to achieve this .
my final amendment is aimed at the inclusion of young people too in a european network , whereas the committee today only proposes women .
thank you .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the will and the ability to innovate are the keys to the economic and social future of the entire community .
europe in particular has to remain a leading player if it is to safeguard its international competitiveness , not only in terms of economic performance but also in the exploitation and widespread application of new forms of technology .
for one thing , i advocate more vigorous support of the scientific and technological option assessment unit ( stoa ) .
i regard this as an absolutely essential point , because technology assessment helps to broaden the range of instruments available for technological forecasting .
the more complex scientific and technical developments become , the more important it is to explain the consequences of new technology to the public and to assist meps in their decision-making with the aid of stoa .
stoa should cooperate closely with the institute for prospective technological studies ( ipts ) , and the ipts should be assigned a key role in improving the coordination of european technology assessments .
one of the main aspects of innovation is the question of security and access to information .
at the euratom conference on the control of nuclear material in novosibirsk , which i attended yesterday , it became clear how important innovation is in the domain of control .
it is also important to be aware of the need to promote initial and advanced training in this domain .
innovation in the field of human resources must take place through the development of the existing programmes , such as socrates , leonardo and tacis .
i also call on the commission to create a european network of women self-starters .
we are undergoing a comprehensive structural transformation from industrial society to service and information society .
the service sector is a women 's domain .
the number of women who have started businesses has increased considerably .
the most important enabling measure for women self-starters is state-aided professional consultancy .
a special coaching model would be highly desirable , in other words advice provided over a lengthy period by a consultant for particularly innovative self-starters , be they men or women .
consideration should be given to the establishment of intersectoral , supraregional and european coordinating agencies for business start-ups .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would first like to pay tribute to mr argyros for the quality of his report .
this report comes at the end of the consultation period which has provided an opportunity to an unprecedented debate on innovation throughout the european union .
the consultation process , for which more than 30 , 000 copies of the green paper were distributed , involved a series of 17 national conferences attended by nearly 5 , 000 executors from business and public authorities .
i should like to comment on the main suggestions contained in parliament 's motion for a resolution . first , the dissemination and exploitation of research and technical development results .
parliament calls for more support for the innovation and mobility programme , and suggests the creation of a dissemination and exploitation task force .
i thank parliament for this support for programmes which the commission proposes to reinforce in the fifth framework programme .
parliament wants there to be greater awareness of the ' innovation ' process , with the preparation of innovation indicators and a rolling review of best national practices in the encouragement of innovation .
the debate centred on the green paper has highlighted the need for deeper knowledge of innovation and the present shortcomings in this area .
the commission will in future be preparing a regular report on innovation in europe and on the policies that support it , drawing on completely reliable indicators .
parliament recommends improving the orientation of research .
i shall come back in due course to certain observations in this chapter , especially those regarding the social aspects of innovation and the task forces .
the fourth concern expressed in this chapter is support for the various forms of cooperation between the innovation actors .
collaboration between complementary professions and occupations , which is one of the basic mechanisms of innovation , will have to be reinforced in the fifth framework programme .
parliament expresses a wish for improved cooperation and coordination between national and community research policies .
as you know , i fully share this concern .
at the time of my inaugural address , i clearly stated to you my intention of using every opportunity afforded by the treaty in this area .
this coordination exercise was systematically launched in the fourth framework programme , since every programme committee is required to devote a proportion of its working time to it each year .
this first stage relates to the pooling of information on existing policies and instruments .
in this context , i must recall that taxation is a national prerogative .
the union therefore has little power of its own to influence policy in this area .
the review recommended by parliament , and previously proposed in the green paper , is one of the measures whose feasibility is being examined by the commission .
as for the financing of innovation , this is one of the priorities which emerges from the consultation , and the commission intends to advance in this area , within the limits imposed by subsidiarity .
the action to be drawn up for the autumn will include a section entitled ' finance and innovation system ' , with four objectives .
all the necessary conditions for the success of such markets , such as the federation of new markets or the asdaqs , need to be in place .
particular aspects need to be considered on the legal and fiscal framework conditions and the provision of training in the necessary new professions , such as that of financial analyst .
thirdly , the conditions for access to long-term loans needs to be improved . finally , the interfaces between technological innovation and the financial world need to be improved .
this is where parliament 's suggestion of technical ratings come in .
this idea , already carried out in belgium and the netherlands , could if successful be adopted by other countries . and the commission may , in that event , be able to assist its dissemination .
the commission also has to ensure that the existing instruments are fully utilized . the commission departments , together with the european investment fund , are exploring ways of steering the latter 's instruments towards innovation .
and a seminar on the subject has been arranged for 25 june .
i would recall that , as far as patents are concerned , our position is less favourable than that of our main competitors , who have the advantage of being subject to unified patent law .
which is more than we can say .
the community patent convention has not yet been ratified , despite the agreement concluded in 1989 .
also , it has been suggested either that the convention should be simplified or that such a drastic measure as reintegrating patent law into community law should be introduced .
the prospects that such a proposal will be adopted - as you know , it will have to be adopted unanimously - by the council seem poor at the present time .
but we cannot leave things as they are .
another point that was mentioned , and an important point , concerns the need to encourage innovation by small and medium-sized enterprises .
the commission is well aware of the potential represented by the smes in the areas of innovation , job creation , flexibility for the economy , and growth .
it is equally desirable to take account of the diversity of these enterprises , and hence the need for policies adjusted to the different categories of sme .
many of them simply want to improve their products or processes by using the most appropriate new technologies , without necessarily having the desire or ability to conduct independent research .
the action taken to assist enterprises of these types is mainly designed to strengthen their capability to absorb new methods and leading-edge technologies .
all these activities aimed at the smes are not , however , always very clear to them .
their clarity and effectiveness need to be strengthened on the occasion of the fifth framework programme .
i also consider it essential not to underestimate the potential represented by large undertakings in the field of research and innovation .
support for collaboration between large undertakings and smes is therefore a line worth pursuing .
among the many recommendations and new ideas that it presents , the report expresses the desire that consideration should be given to means of steering the structural funds to innovation .
the mid-term revision of these community support frameworks , currently covering the period 1994-1999 , can provide an opportunity to emphasize this orientation .
the report also suggests the establishment of a network for women who set up in business .
the commission entirely agrees with parliament regarding the need to take account of the social dimension in innovation policies .
i myself wanted the final socioeconomic research programme to include a section on training and one on exclusion .
this social concern , like environmental protection , education and health , prompted the choice of themes for the first task forces .
as regards involving workers in the process of innovation within enterprises , my conviction is that this practice must become more widespread and become one of the basic principles of human resources management and the quest for quality .
regarding education and continuing training after initial education , i believe we are equally convinced that this is the crucible in which individual capacity for innovation has to be forged .
it must therefore play the greatest possible part in the acquisition of skills , such as creativity , a taste for experiment , and the aptitude for communication and teamwork .
technical education and vocational training must not be devalued , but the acquisition of a basic general culture is essential to facilitate the lasting suitability for new functions which innovation requires .
in any case , it is an illusion to believe that a satisfactory education can be acquired once and for all in the early years of life .
training becomes a necessity that lasts all one 's life .
a great many proposals on this subject are included in the white paper on education and training . the implementation of the socrates and leonardo programmes will incorporate specific measures to encourage innovation .
although the responsibility for this is primarily national , it is important that a stimulus should be provided at community level .
that is why , together with my colleague martin bangemann , i launched the initiative entitled ' learning in the information society ' .
i now come to the subject of the task forces .
this is a subject which was extensively debated on the occasion of the review of the proposal to extend the fourth framework programme . that debate enabled the situation to be clarified .
i believe , in particular , that the two objectives aimed at by the creation of this instrument have been identified .
i have noted that parliament regrets the insufficient attention paid to innovative sectors such as the information society , biotechnology and environmental technologies .
i would remind you that it is not the purpose of the green paper to undertake an in-depth study of specific technological or sectoral themes .
nevertheless , i do of course recognize the importance of the information society and the promise held out by biotechnology and environmental technologies .
the rapid utilization of all the potential opened up by the new information technology is certainly one of the major sources of innovation , both for business and for the public authorities and services .
the setting up of the task force on educational multimedia and the initiative to be undertaken in the area of the information society form part of this logic .
that , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , concludes the comments i have felt prompted to make by this very comprehensive and dense report , benefiting as it does from the opinions of several committees .
innovation is a crucial issue for the economy and for employment , and it has indeed been treated as such .
i can only welcome that , and i have no doubt that this political conclusion will shortly be confirmed at the florence summit .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , madam commissioner , the euret programme is the first specific programme for research and technological development in the field of transport .
it started off in 1991 under the second framework programme .
the transport sector is pre-eminently a sector requiring a european approach .
research on and the introduction of new techniques and technologies are of decisive importance for solving the european transport problem .
the start of european research in this field in 1991 must therefore at least be referred to as late .
so it is no wonder that there is no european vision in the direction of r & d in the field of transport by land , sea or air .
the report before us today is an evaluation of the euret programme prepared by a panel of five independent specialists .
this evaluation was only started a year after the programme was due to come to an end. moreover at the insistence of the commission the evaluation had to be prepared within six weeks .
it therefore lacks depth . the experts say so themselves .
every member of this parliament has the right according to the treaty of rome to work in his or her own language .
nevertheless that right is regularly trampled under foot by the commission .
the way in which the evaluation of the euret programme has been approached is not acceptable to your rapporteur .
it would have been possible to start with the evaluation before all projects had been wholly completed .
it is true that an interim report was made in 1993 but even that report came out a year later than had been envisaged .
it referred to all the gaps in the control and management structure of the projects .
nevertheless there was no adjustment .
the final report on the euret programme was drawn up only after the specific transport programme in the fourth framework programme had been approved .
the final evaluation of euret thus failed in its mission . it made no contribution to the fourth framework programme .
the committee on research therefore hopes that the experts ' recommendations will at least be used in the implementation of the specific programme and in the drafting of the fifth framework programme .
according to the panel 's recommendations the commission needs to take appropriate steps to arrive at joint or at least coherent aims with regard to research and technological policy and the common transport policy .
the 1995 external monitoring report also calls on the commission for a more specific vision in the field of transport .
cohesion between the programme 's various areas of research and collaboration with other dgs in this field is essential .
overlapping must be avoided .
sustainable mobility can be achieved only if the proper strategies are developed .
the fourth framework programme is directed particularly to transport efficiency and only marginally to prevention and changes in modal distribution .
tele-working therefore needs to be encouraged throughout europe because that is a specific technological application which may reduce mobility .
a further aim of many member states is to reduce environmental pollution such as the emission of various harmful substances , by means of energy efficiency .
research can make an important contribution to the development of environment-friendly technology in the transport sector .
for that too a european vision with a planned approach would not be out of place .
clean engines which use considerably less energy and therefore burn more cleanly would make the car more acceptable as a means of transport .
for that a european directive on maximum emissions is needed .
finally my last point . in 1994 when the period envisaged had expired , a further ecu 8 million was spent on extra appropriations in order to ensure that a number of projects within euret were continued .
can the commission say how that ecu 8 million breaks down ?
and what was the percentage contributed by member states to these projects ?
in conclusion , mr president , transport , together with energy , the environment and town and country planning , is a crucial sector for the european economy in the coming century .
well-regulated transport means energyefficient , environment-friendly transport with the infrastructure geared to town and country planning .
it would be sensible if the commission were to develop such a vision in consultation with the european parliament .
the positive obverse side of european research lies in innovation .
but the reverse side of the coin is the project which we are discussing at the moment on the evaluation of a series of programmes related to transport .
experience in this respect has been problematical but the research which is at present under way and which is due to continue , is very important .
transport is increasingly one more structural variable on top of so many other social , economic and all sorts of other variables .
it has not been possible for the recommendations of the group of experts to be incorporated in the fourth framework programme , and that is really serious .
i hope there will be no repetition of this and that studies on transport will nevertheless continue to be an important feature of subjects for research .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to make it clear that i am replying here on behalf of mr neil kinnock , who is currently travelling on official business .
the euret programme has replaced the union 's original research programme in the transport sector .
that was a trial .
to judge by the general tenor of the evaluation report by the independent experts , that trial has been considered conclusive .
like the evaluation report , the report prepared by mrs plooij-van gorsel acknowledges the important contribution made by research to the definition and exploitation of an efficient european transport system which at the same time respects the environment .
i welcome that .
mrs plooij-van gorsel does however make various critical remarks regarding the content of the evaluation report and the way in which that evaluation was undertaken , and those remarks are reflected in the motion for a resolution .
rather than considering them all one by one , i would like to comment briefly on some of them .
that is only partially true .
the first period for submitting proposals for the new programme in fact ended on 15 march 1995 .
some of the recommendations made by the experts were thus able to be taken into consideration .
overall , however , the commission shares the feeling that the evaluation report on euret was not available at the time when it would have been most useful .
nor was it the only one to be in that situation , because of the provisions adopted in the third framework programme .
this situation was rectified with the fourth framework programme .
in the adoption decision , it is clearly stipulated that the evaluation reports must be available and disclosed to the european parliament before the commission presents its proposal for the fifth framework programme .
the question of the coordination and complementarity of the european and national efforts , mentioned in sections 5 and 6 , also has to be considered in a qualified manner .
a minimum of coordination was guaranteed , as is always the case , through the agency of the programme committee .
here again , especially , i can reassure you .
in the follow-up to the commission communication , ' achieving coordination through cooperation ' , the crest had its coordinating mandate strengthened .
ad hoc groups , broadly supporting programme committees , were set up .
they were intended to make it possible to ensure good coordination and optimum complementarity between national and european activities .
as to the problem of administrative expenditure , mentioned in section 13 of the motion for a resolution , it must be considered in the light of all the different aspects .
of course this figure is higher than the average , too high , and in future we will need to ensure that expenditure in this category does not rise to such a level .
but the programme was a small-scale one and , as you know , there are fixed costs that cannot be reduced .
it is more difficult , therefore , to keep the administrative costs of smaller programmes at the ideal level .
above all , this was a first programme , so that this expenditure can be regarded as investment outlay .
thanks to this above-average effort , the administrative costs of the ' transport ' programme amounted to only 4.9 % of the total committed credits .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
cooperation in research and technological development
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this report is being presented on an evening when we have just discussed the excellent report by my colleague mr argyros , and my own report is naturally complementary to his .
the aim is to define , for the first time , the principles of a strategy for scientific and technical cooperation between the european union and the rest of the world .
this attempt had never been made before .
contacts were made haphazardly , as it were , between the european union , especially the commission , and its permanent representations in third countries .
there was no defined strategy .
in fact , i could ask no better proof of this than the confusion - the unacceptable confusion - that exists in the commission 's report between scientific cooperation as such and technological cooperation .
and , as in the commission report , which might have been discarded if parliament had not been there , the projects are not identified .
and it is nevertheless necessary to maintain and recognize those fields of excellence that are specific and particular to the european union .
we can wave our arms around as much as we like , we shall achieve nothing .
this approach calls for a number of task forces , which have been defined .
next , it is important to initiate targeted projects for monitoring space and the earth , for telecommunications and multimedia and , especially , for biology too , particularly in the field of genome research .
also , one point that has not been touched upon either in the communication on innovation or in the commission communication on cooperation with third countries is scientific and technical surveillance .
this can provide a basis for defining a genuine policy of cooperation with third countries , designed to bring to the fore a europe of competences .
as regards the last amendment put forward by mr holm , i have to confess that i do not understand it .
it seems to me that he is firing at his own side , since research into the elimination of fissile materials will in fact lead to dangers of proliferation .
a breakdown on the basis of policy objectives ought to be considered for the fifth framework programme .
that is the thrust of the three amendments proposed by the committee on external economic relations to strengthen mr pompidou 's text further , and i congratulate him again on an excellent report .
mr president , let me first thank the rapporteur , dr pompidou , for the excellent report that he has produced .
i also thank him for the special attention he has paid to the priority given by the development committee to the need to intensify the cooperation between the european union and developing countries in research and technological development .
i would also like to thank the secretary-general of the acp , dr carl greenidge who during an interesting hearing presented to the development committee the acp perspective on the most important issues .
his contribution helped us to identify the needs of the developing countries .
there is an increasing demand for cooperation on the part of the developing countries because of their awareness of the fundamental importance of being involved in the rapidly increasing innovation that is taking place in research and technological development .
some of the areas of specific interest that have to be addressed include food supply , health and environmental protection and energy issues .
these can make an important contribution in relation to new employment opportunities , to remove the many development bottlenecks and to overcome the marginalization of developing countries in global agricultural production and manufacturing .
food security and the health sector represent the main priority .
the need to strengthen cooperation between developing countries is urgent as underlined by the alarming report from the world health organisation on the increasing spread of epidemics and resurgence of diseases in new , resistant forms .
a global emergency has been declared by the world health organisation on tuberculosis , which has killed millions of people in recent years .
famines which were relatively rare in africa in the 1960s , re-emerged as endemic in the 1980s and 1990s .
according to the food and agricultural organisation , 44 out of 52 african countries are presently threatened by severe food shortages .
devoting resources to getting more food to a given area is therefore of high priority .
a few guidelines should be essential to our cooperation with the developing countries , if we are to implement a research policy that truly serves development needs .
the development committee was very happy to commend this report , as do i here tonight .
for many years , indeed , we have seen the economic structure , the financial system and even environmental hazards assuming global dimensions .
it is not only astronauts who see the world as a single entity .
the world itself is developing an increasing number of common visions .
but the coordination of many activities into one global action must not blind us to the fact that continental , national and regional conflicts are on the increase .
some of them , as you know , are discussed here in the house too .
the cold war may be over , but real wars , conflicts between groups , regions and states , have not subsided .
in addition , we are increasingly conscious of differing attitudes on to ethics , tolerance and human rights , as well as to environmental matters and technological safety .
these have become more visible , especially against the background of global competition .
the global scientific society must follow the global economy .
what i mean to say is that it is extremely important for us to develop , nurture and intensify a dialogue between the various cultures on values , on basic attitudes .
we shall be supporting the resolutions tabled by the committee on research , technological development and energy .
cooperation and the exchange of knowledge in research and technological development are a sine qua non for research workers .
they presuppose , of course , adherence to basic principles , and especially the protection of intellectual and industrial property .
these agreements must promote the exchange of knowledge , via the use , especially , of global information technology networks .
the involvement of the european union 's neighbours , namely the countries of the mediterranean basin and of central and eastern europe , the baltic countries and the newly developing countries of the former soviet union , is important .
in closing , i should like to say that this report to a large extent covers the points to which i have referred . it gives me pleasure therefore to congratulate professor pompidou on his truly excellent work .
mr president , i should like to begin by complimenting mr pompidou on his report and in particular the distinction he draws between scientific cooperation and technological development is excellent .
universities have been cooperating on scientific matters for a long time past .
even before there was any mention of an information society the universities already had euarn ( european academic research network ) .
new advanced applications often come from the academic world , where there is good collaboration in the field of information technology .
now all european national research networks , associated in dante , have applied for a project ten 34 which aims at linking all these networks by means of 34 megabyte optical fibre cables .
it will be possible to carry out experiments and to develop european standards which we are so looking forward to .
so it is incomprehensible for the liberal group that this project , which can really help us in the competition stakes has already been blocked by dg iii and dg xiii in the commission for a year past .
i hope that in the future the commission too will learn to cooperate so that international cooperation will be possible in the academic world also .
mr president , as a number of speakers have already stated , it is a very important and good report that mr pompidou has produced .
i tabled several amendments in committee which mr pompidou and the committee endorsed .
however , there is still one thing on which mr pompidou and i do not agree , and that is my amendment concerning plutonium .
what we want to see is not the proliferation of plutonium , of course , but global cooperation to resolve the problem of plutonium and other fissionable material .
in the union alone there are today 340 tonnes of plutonium , which makes the resolution of this issue of the utmost importance .
this can be done in cooperation with other countries which unfortunately also , like those in the union , have large quantities of plutonium .
plutonium is dangerous and this is an issue which affects me as a young person a great deal because i know that something could happen involving it .
international cooperation on this subject is therefore of the utmost importance .
thank you very much .
mr president , the two reports we have dealt with this evening - the argyros report and the pompidou report - are very closely interrelated .
that is also demonstrated by the almost identical lists of speakers .
as this debate draws to its close i really wish to confine myself to a very few remarks .
first of all i should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very clear report , which has brought a great deal of order to a number of instruments that had never before been properly collated .
the devil , however , is so much in the detail here as in the implementation .
for example , we are going to need clear statements on codetermination and on the possible cofinancing of research projects by third countries .
there must also be decisions regarding the right to use the results of such research and regarding entitlement to subsequent profits .
that brings us to the question of intellectual property .
the absence of harmonized rules governing intellectual property is not unique to europe .
we shall also have to incorporate the national rules that already exist , of course , into international agreements .
we shall have to guarantee compatibility .
but we also need compatibility between all the factors associated with venture capital and with mixed public / private funding .
a great deal has been said today about all these points .
such harmonization will serve us well when it comes to cooperating at international level .
parliament has always shown a special interest in this question , and has undertaken various initiatives in this field .
this report and this motion for a resolution are a logical continuation of those efforts .
mr pompidou 's report comprises a very valuable attempt at clarification , and the motion for a resolution - while broadly supporting the commission 's approach - introduces a number of ideas which undeniably deserve consideration .
overall , then , the commission can only express its agreement .
without going into detail about the very numerous articles contained in the resolution , i would like to make a few brief comments on three points .
the resolution calls on the commission to specify the arrangements for cooperation , by distinguishing between the various types of collaboration and the major categories of countries .
i can tell you that a seminar on international scientific and technological cooperation , attended by representatives of all these bodies and of the commission , will be held during the second half of this year .
finally , the resolution rightly emphasizes the need for closer cooperation between the activities of the union and those of its member states in this field .
work on this question has begun .
the hope is that it will shortly result in the establishment of an initial basis for improved coordination , and i shall be sure to keep you informed of the developments that occur in this field .
the commission intends this importance to be clearly reflected in its future actions .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
financial instrument for the environment ( life )
mr president , in italy the name life is currently being used by a group of secessionist tax refusers , so its reputation is none too good .
to achieve this result , the life rules need to be clarified , gaps filled in and obstacles eliminated .
that means that we must be very cautious in awarding these funds and ensure that the money is spent on useful projects .
in the past there have been repeated complaints of a lack of transparency in the awarding of funds .
the main root of the problem has been that no precise criteria for the selection of projects were laid down in the original life programme .
so the primary objective of the revised life proposal under discussion today is to establish such criteria .
today 's text considerably improves the catalogue of elimination and evaluation criteria for life applications .
on behalf of my group i very much welcome that .
how the evaluation criteria work in practice remains to be seen and will have to be reviewed in due course .
given the shortage of funds , that is something we simply cannot afford to do .
that is why i say that the best available technology must be used as the basis of evaluation when it comes to selecting projects for the further development of existing technology .
the common position on the directive defines the term ' best available technology ' , which means that an agreed basis for the use of the term is already in place .
some countries do need to catch up , and instead of being content to go on letting them lag behind we should ensure that their technology reflects the state of the art by providing them with the necessary funds .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , it is fair to point out that community policy on the environment has been carried out ever more comprehensively and effectively .
the proposal for a council regulation on the establishment of a financial instrument for the environment - the life programme - which we support , forms part of this policy .
i should like to believe that the member states will take proper advantage of all the aid this regulation offers them .
mr president , many thanks to mrs marinucci for her very good report that we have been discussing here .
' environment ' , it seems , is but a word , an empty shell .
ecu 600 million had almost been voted by the council .
a majority of the ministers were on the point of agreeing , when things suddenly took a turn for the worse .
petty jealousies , concern that too much money might be poured into the south , finally won the day , and agreement was reached on ecu 450 million .
does this amount really reflect the wishes of the european people ?
what is more , this amount of ecu 450 million has been earmarked for a multiannual programme .
this is downright scandalous , mrs bjerregaard !
there am i , on the one hand , protecting the livelihood of tobacco-growers , while on the other hand they probably have no clean water to drink and too little pure air to breathe .
the one is really no substitute for the other .
i should also like to mention the commission 's laxity with regard to the investigation of the misuse of life funds in italy .
why has it taken so long to institute proceedings ?
this reticence on the part of the commission is losing us a great deal of money every year !
lastly , i wanted to mention that the inclusion of the countries of central and eastern europe is very important to us , because environmental conditions in some parts of those countries are disastrous .
but if that is mentioned as a priority , commissioner , we must also be prepared to find the necessary resources .
where will you obtain the money for such priorities ?
i am interested to hear that .
mr president , we shall support mrs marinucci 's proposal for presenting these seven amendments again .
we should like to draw attention to two of them .
i could mention many : do&ntilde;ana , las tablas de daimiel , santo&ntilde;a and so on .
on the other hand amendment no 5 proposes more funds .
the problem always lies in the scant resources allocated for dealing with a programme like nature 2000 .
dg xi itself has sent us today a very interesting bulletin , no 1 , in which it is clearly shown how many countries there are which have still not started to designate their special areas for conservation .
this very week in my country , in the island of lanzarote , which is a biospheric reserve , military installations have led to the disappearance of a plant which is unique in the world .
the only place in which it lived was the risco de zamara in the island of lanzarote .
mr president , madam commissioner .
life has proved to be a successful environmental policy instrument , not least as far as finland is concerned , judging by our experience of one year of membership .
the proposed budget of ecu 450 million for the entire second stage of life is , however , totally insufficient , especially if the intention is to broaden the scope of the instrument .
as far as the share allocated to third world countries is concerned , where the problems are severe , the amount is really negligible , a mere five per cent .
the effectiveness of life should be safeguarded .
in other words , efforts should be made to ensure that projects are implemented as planned , but monitoring problems should be solved other than by means of increased bureaucracy .
since the aim is to improve the procedure for project selection by laying down new criteria to govern eligibility for financial assistance , the entire application procedure should be made as clear and as open as possible .
projects should have genuine merit .
with respect to industrial projects , particular attention should be given to whether the project really is innovative . they should promote the development and application of the most useful technology available .
a clean , viable environment is fundamental to the future of mankind .
we will not achieve real and lasting environmental improvements until such time as a sufficient number of people are aware of the real state of the environment and are willing to assume responsibility for it .
this is why i consider it very important that the results of these projects are communicated efficiently , so that the information can be circulated as widely as possible .
mr president , first of all i should like to say that the commission much appreciates parliament 's speedy second reading of the council 's common position .
i am happy to note that we are approaching the target in the best possible conditions .
it may be regarded as being the bright spot for the european environment and for the fruitful development which life is trying to promote thanks to a creative strategy in which new methods and technologies are used .
personally i am quite pleased with the commission 's common position , which is the result of lengthy discussions and which represents a compromise which the commission can use as a working basis in the period 1996-1999 .
of course it is not a perfect compromise since the council has not included some of the improvements which parliament had proposed and which the commission had accepted .
but that is not so serious , since the most essential is included , and as the rapporteur , mrs marinucci rightly said , the text resulting from the common position has turned out clear and positive .
the commission thinks that the greater part of the amendments - and there are in fact only a few - put forward here in second reading , point in the right direction .
the commission actually accepted the first four in november last year and incorporated them in the modified proposal in january .
amendment no 6 , tabled by mrs marinucci , is new and explains what is , in the commission 's opinion , a quite essential point .
i share mrs marinucci 's view that with no reference basis , the most suitable projects may be selected by a transparent application of the criteria in the regulation .
the choice of the criteria to be taken as the basis , together with the procedure for selection of projects is the only way to avoid misunderstandings at the implementation stage .
i therefore undertake to draft a statement from the commission to the council on the basis of amendment no 6 in order to call attention to parliament 's wishes .
so i can say that the commission accepts the principle of the amendment but will in due course give it a suitable form .
amendment no 7 can of course be accepted in the light of that statement replacing amendment no 6 .
mr president , i shall urge the council to look again at the aspects raised by the amendments in the hope that it will accept this in principle , if necessary with certain adjustments in drafting .
i must on the other hand admit that the commission does not regard amendment no 5 as being a step in the right direction .
with regard to form the commission cannot agree with the idea of stating a specific amount in the document .
with regard to content the commission does not think that it will be possible with the present budgetary perspectives to go further than the council 's proposal to consider the situation afresh in 1997 .
in my opinion the essential factor is that the council has recognized the disproportion between the interest in life and the budget available .
that shows in a way that the council shares parliament 's view , as expressed here this evening , and that the council is trying to improve the situation as far as possible .
the commission will therefore submit a remodelled proposal to the council as soon as possible with a view to approval of the second stage of life in june .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
( the sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m. )
extraordinary council meeting of 3 / 4 june 1996
the first item is the statement by the council on the results of its extraordinary meeting of 3 and 4 june 1996 , followed by a statement by the commission .
but i would first like to mention the approach taken by the agriculture council in its discussions since the british government laid the official information on bse before it last march .
the council has expressed its determination to take all necessary measures to ensure the protection of public health .
as emphasized in the texts approved at the council meetings of 1-3 april and 29-30 april , the priority has been to ensure a high level of health protection on the basis of the available scientific data .
following this decision , the united kingdom adopted a series of measures to eradicate and prevent the spread of bse throughout its territory , and the commission has been monitoring the implementation of these measures through repeated inspections .
a report on the commission 's last inspection mission to the united kingdom , conducted from 28 to 31 may , was presented to the council on monday 3 june .
the council decided that all the new documents received should be thoroughly examined by the relevant community departments .
essentially this involved permitting exports of three by-products : gelatine , tallow and bull semen .
this proposal reached the council after the standing veterinary committee failed to provide an opinion on 20 may .
on the basis of the current rules of procedure , the council could then approve the proposal from the commission by qualified majority , amend it unanimously or reject it by simple majority .
in fact it was on this last item , - semen exports - that there was strongest resistance from some delegations , and that meant there was no qualified majority .
in fact this is the criterion underlying the commission 's whole approach to lifting the ban progressively , only as and when the scientific evidence justifies it .
you will be aware that the commission adopted the proposed measures yesterday and they will come into force as from next monday , 10 june .
the united kingdom is visiting the various capitals to this end. the british delegation was received yesterday evening by the italian foreign and health ministers and by myself .
the united kingdom has a very detailed framework programme for the eradication of the disease and is seeking a commitment from the european partners to examine and approve it quickly .
the italian presidency recommended thorough examination of the document by the european commission and the appropriate community scientific and technical bodies .
this will take place over the next few days with a view to providing firmer scientific and inspection data on which to base a gradual and justified series of measures leading to a possible lifting of the ban .
it has been impossible to take important decisions for the operation of the single market in the areas of development policy , social affairs , the economy and finance because of the united kingdom 's non-cooperation policy .
the president-in-office of the council and commission president santer have stressed in an official letter to prime minister major that there is no justification for such behaviour .
we also confirmed this yesterday evening to the british foreign and agriculture ministers .
encouraging signals are now being received from the british government and we look forward to definite confirmation .
given the urgency the council decided to ask the european parliament for an opinion on this proposal in the next session of 17-21 june .
we must all work together to send a message of confidence to the world of the producers and to the consumers .
so i feel sure the european parliament , which is the most genuine expression of public opinion , will support us on the road we must travel together .
in particular , i should like to report on the events that have taken place in the last few days and over the past week .
the commission , as you know , took a decision yesterday about gelatine , tallow and bulls ' semen .
in taking that decision , the commission was fulfilling its responsibility to take steps that will help to normalize the situation in the european union .
the commission decided on these measures long before the british announcement of a non-cooperation policy at european level and believes it is necessary to hold fast to this course despite any acts of political escalation .
however , as the president of the commission , jacques santer , explained to the house yesterday , the british policy of obstruction is making the work of the commission increasingly difficult .
before dealing with the substance of yesterday 's decision , i should like to report briefly on the other developments , one at a time .
one thing that seems important to me is that last week from 28 to 31 may the second inspection took place in the united kingdom .
the main purpose of the inspection was to check on the implementation of the programme for cattle older than thirty months , cattle which must not enter into the human or animal food chain .
in addition , observance of the ban on feeding animal and bone meal and progress in the introduction of a new system of animal identification were also checked .
the programme for the slaughter and disposal of animals over the age of 30 months is now fully operative .
by the end of may , around 80 000 animals had been slaughtered under that programme .
the programme presents an enormous challenge to all concerned , and especially to the authorities .
the inspection team noted in its report that the british authorities were making great efforts to establish appropriate procedures for the proper implementation of the programme and to effect improvements which initial difficulties had shown to be necessary .
there are still problems , however , with regard to individual aspects , such as coordination problems relating to certain bodies involved in the programme and problems with the settlement of compensation claims .
the products therefore have to be kept in storage until they are finally incinerated .
i therefore believe that an organizational streamlining of the programme is desirable and would help the uk authorities to solve the present verification problems .
the united kingdom has also now been making great efforts to enforce the feed ban .
i hope that the waste-return programme currently under examination , whereby feed residues from feed mixers and similar installations are taken back and disposed of , will provide additional safety .
two sets of talks were also held last week , one with representatives of the portuguese authorities and the other with representatives of the british authorities about their respective slaughter programmes .
as a result of this preparatory work , it should be possible at today 's meeting of the standing veterinary committee to discuss the portuguese slaughter programme in detail and , if circumstances permit , to adopt a decision .
at the end of last week , the united kingdom presented the commission authorities with the draft of a very comprehensive slaughter programme comprising just over 120 pages as well as an extensive technical annex .
this programme was also distributed to the member states through the council .
the programme will now need to be discussed and examined in detail , and that will also be done by the standing veterinary committee today .
the opinions of the member states on this programme are expected to be delivered at that meeting , and i hope that we shall be able to make appropriate progress today in this area too .
but let me now deal briefly with the three products to which i referred at the start , namely gelatine , tallow and bulls ' semen .
as you know , back in early april the council adopted conclusions in which it asked the commission to have its scientific committees examine the list of products covered by the export ban .
this was done at various meetings held by a highly diverse group of committees in the course of april .
the scientists there reached the conclusion that bulls ' semen posed no danger and should therefore be removed from the list of banned products .
their conclusion on gelatine and tallow was that the establishment of safe production processes which guarantee deactivation of the bse pathogen can eliminate any health risk connected with these products .
in its conclusions at the end of april , the council then asked the commission to submit a proposal for a set of rules covering the aforementioned products in line with these scientific findings .
the commission responded to this request and on 15 may presented the standing veterinary committee with a draft opinion .
this was discussed in detail , but the veterinary committee has yet to deliver its opinion .
this meant that the procedure was to be continued , which was done yesterday .
the commission duly took the decision , empowering the president and myself to implement it on monday , following the expiry of the statutory period during which the council may take the decision .
let me explain briefly the ins and outs of this decision .
it is not the case that the export ban on these products expires on monday , so to speak . with regard to bulls ' semen , we have no objections on the basis of the scientists ' opinion .
for that reason , bulls ' semen can once more be sold within the european union .
as for gelatine and tallow , in our regulation we have defined a safe process by which these products must be manufactured in future .
it is also necessary , however , that companies which intend to produce gelatine or tallow obtain a licence .
this licence will be issued by the british government .
only when the production process has passed this inspection will the commission give the go-ahead for the marketing of the product in question .
( applause )
what is to be done ?
but we cannot give in to that , we must make the right signals .
now , was yesterday 's decision by the commission on the partial lifting of the ban right ?
it opens a window of opportunity , breaches the solid wall which would not serve the citizen well because it suggests ulterior motives .
i know there is strong anti-british feeling in the countryside , but isolating the united kingdom is no way to handle this crisis .
the problem is a collective one .
but we are also telling the british government and above all the british people that political opposition to europe is no way to deal with their problem .
hindering europol or the fight against racism is not going to gain them more attention for their legitimate national interests .
lifting the ban , by whatever means , will not restore consumer confidence .
the more the table is thumped , the more obvious it is that there are no other arguments on the table .
all this can be done . it is reasonable , and shows political sense which is also common sense .
but if political situations can be created for purposes of domestic political window-dressing , europe will be in a permanent state of gelatine .
minister pinto has brought us positive signals today and i do not think it is irresponsible optimism to say that more europe is needed , not less europe .
many will say that the plan of action to exclude from the human food chain all parts of bovine carcasses which could convey infection , if it were transmissible to man , should have started five years ago .
well it did , because all ruminant material which could convey bse to cattle was excluded six years ago .
all cattle suffering from bse have been slaughtered to date .
that is 190 , 000 of them since 1992 , costing ecu 180m .
a further ecu 63m has been spent on research and administrative controls have cost a further ecu 43m .
the budget for research in the united kingdom has been increased and the meat hygiene service budget also increased by &pound; 39m for additional control .
these measures have had a clear impact ; the number of confirmed cases has dropped since 1992 from 36 , 000 to 8 , 000 and it is still declining .
i invite everyone to read and consider the further action programme , all 121 pages of it , and to consider what has happened .
since 29 march , 81 , 648 cattle have been slaughtered under the government 's scheme of carcass disposal .
last week , the total slaughter exceeded 25 , 000 and that includes the cold storage and 1 , 500 further emergencies .
in addition , 20 , 000 calves have been slaughtered since 29 march , 4 , 000 a week .
we are very grateful to the commission for the compensation and the added intervention and support measures which i hope have been agreed .
with a framework plan of action for tightening measures for dealing with bse , i hope we can now remove the crisis of confidence and restore normal trading as soon as possible .
mr president , we understand that lord plumb has to put a good face on a terrible story ; we feel for him .
mr president , i presented the truth .
mr president , mr president-in-office , commissioner , these first speeches could actually make us feel moderately optimistic .
but the fear is too great for us to surrender right away and lower our guard immediately .
this is no time to get carried away by optimism .
well , between contamination and non-contamination lies an even more terrible evil and it strikes at the consumer .
it is doubt , and while there is doubt they will not buy meat , and we all know what repercussions follow .
personally - but i think my group will feel the same as me - i am puzzled about the partial lifting of the ban on gelatine , tallow and bull semen .
lord plumb will forgive me , but i am a little sceptical about the guarantees the british government is offering on the licences for these exports .
if these licences are presented , i would ask the commissioner to supervise the situation very carefully .
the events of the last few days , the opposition and obstruction minister pinto has condemned , are a clear expression of the attitude the british intend to bring to this matter .
the problem is very complex and involves scientific , agricultural , economic , psychological , political , institutional aspects .
the way the situation has developed through the relationships between various institutions is not very clear , not very transparent , not very convincing .
so how and what do we decide ?
solidarity with those affected , yes , but consumer protection and public health must come first .
commissioner fischler has talked about this and given assurances .
now i want to ask him if there are sufficient resources to guarantee this action .
we hope so !
then there are the economic measures .
ecu 650 million is not very much : a lot of people have said so and i agree .
it would make matters worse if it were badly distributed .
and there is some concern in countries like italy , spain , greece and portugal which are net importers of calves .
for instance , italy produces 20 % of bullocks and according to early indications would only receive 6 % of this special intervention .
mr president-in-office , commissioner , we shall be on the alert to make sure that insult is not added to injury !
mr president , the embargo on british meat and derived products has achieved three things .
and it has obliged the united kingdom to adopt a number of measures at last . but it will still take some time before consumers ' confidence is restored outside the united kingdom .
even if the ban were completed lifted , most people would still not be ready to eat british meat .
now that the commission has decided partially to lift the embargo i call upon the commission to make sure that no member state independently introduces new import barriers .
let the commission also ensure that similar safety standards are applied in the whole european union .
but , mr president , i want above all to speak of the political background to this crisis .
the british ship of state is a rudderless vessel which has run aground on rocks of its own making .
there is a bitter irony behind the many inconsistencies in the british position .
after blocking 30 measures in less than three weeks perhaps we should even thank britain because london has demonstrated how necessary it is to replace the unanimity rule by majority voting .
but , mr president , above all i should like to express today my deep concern at the emergence of a venomous nationalism in the united kingdom .
there is mention of a wave of insults against germany and german citizens . that wave fills me as a citizen of the netherlands and as a european with disappointment and shame .
how easy it is , 50 years after the second world war to summon up a xenophobic storm and to wallow in chauvinism .
how easy it is to call up once more the demons of intolerance and prejudice which have so often disfigured european civilization .
( applause ) how easy it is , ladies and gentlemen , for a government to encourage nationalism instead of resisting it .
there is no honour in that strategy , ladies and gentlemen .
each of us , as politicians is faced with a choice .
we can exploit prejudices or we can help to spread tolerance .
we can excuse prejudices or we can oppose them .
we can preach nationalism or we can strengthen the rule of law within the european union .
the conservative party has made its choice .
that party has chosen nationalism as its electoral strategy .
the conservative party is no longer the party of responsible government and of one nation .
the conservative party has become the english national party .
( applause ) some courageous individuals such as emma nicholson , have made their choice .
they have left the conservative party to join the only british party which consistently follows a pro-european line .
it is time for those of her colleagues who share her concern to follow her example .
by letting party interests prevail over the country 's interests the conservative party has shown clearly where it stands .
it is time for my conservative friends in the european parliament to do the same .
let them put principle above party .
let them choose an england in the heart of europe .
let them choose the only british party which is not ambivalent about europe .
let them join the british and european liberals .
it is time to make their choice .
( applause )
mr president , perhaps there is no need for me to mention the wrong approach taken by the british government but you will perhaps allow me an observation on the functioning in this case of the community institutions .
the underlying problem with bse is that political decisions have been subordinated to economic pressures in the united kingdom .
the disease originated with the introduction of meal of animal origin into animal feed and a change in the industrial processes to which it was subjected .
both of those factors yielded considerable profits and it is highly significant that when it was shown that meal of animal origin was responsible for bse the multinationals pulled out of manufacturing animal feed so as to avoid responsibility .
but if blocking the community institutions does not count as political pressure i cannot imagine what does .
the commission claims to have scientific evidence in this connection , but it is not publishing it or passing an appropriate opinion on to the relevant scientific bodies .
mr fischler has just referred in his speech to the debate in the veterinary committee , which ended without any positive statement that the ban could be lifted .
there are surprising arguments in the media .
i cannot understand what the fact that the disease is not transmitted through the genes has to do with gelatine or tallow .
we also hear about the report provided by an association of gelatine makers on the safety of those products .
however , in the commission 's earlier decisions it was stated that in the present state of knowledge there were no known processes which could fully guarantee to render the infective agent inactive .
it must be made clear that decisions are based on rigorously scientific grounds so that it may not be thought that economic interests and political pressures are taking precedence over protection of the public health .
the line taken in the cap has led to certain problems .
the quest for competitiveness at any price encourages the introduction of methods and techniques whose long-term consequences are unknown .
the cap was set up at the beginning of the 60s to guarantee europe 's food supply .
mr president , there is no anti-british climate , either in the house or in our group .
there is , however , a british government which is irresponsibly banking on political and administrative pressure and creating an atmosphere in which nationalist chauvinism can rear its head again , which we should scarcely have thought possible .
and there is a british government which , by means of this political and administrative pressure , is preventing the necessary measures in the united kingdom that could lead to effective suppression of this disease .
mr fischler , this morning you have again been speaking of ' could ' , ' should ' and ' ought to ' with reference to the measures that the british government must introduce .
you do not tell us what the british government has done , because it has to be assumed that , apart from exerting political pressure , it has not done very much .
it is true that the suppression of bse cannot be restricted to the export ban alone .
it is a european problem , as we have always said , not an english disease , so we all have responsibility to bear .
but at a time when political pressure is being applied , a decision to relax restrictions sends the wrong signal and has nothing to do with scientific findings or responsible behaviour !
and how you want to explain the lifting of the ban on bulls ' sperm , when it is perfectly clear that the disease is transmissible from one generation to the next , is beyond me .
i believe it is time to return to an objective discussion focused on bse and to explore seriously every possible scientific avenue .
our group originally wanted to approve this joint resolution .
we assumed that the commission had not yet reached its final decision .
we enquired about the scientific findings in order to substantiate our decision .
but now you have crossed the rubicon .
the die is cast .
that is why our group can no longer subscribe to this resolution .
we retract our signature .
we are opposed to a relaxation at this point in time and on the basis of the available findings .
mr president , i am glad this debate is taking place now .
as you know , our group and the liberal , democratic and reformist group wished it to take place during the last part-session .
it is certainly not before time .
this is a crisis which affects the whole of europe .
i am a citizen of the united kingdom but i think it is totally shameful and irresponsible of the uk government to try to paralyse the entire decision-making mechanism of the european union on this issue .
of that there should be no doubt whatsoever .
it is even more galling when we think that this was supposed to be the great year of advance for europe .
with the intergovernmental conference we were going to try to bring europe closer together .
instead , what we are getting is a series of petty veto measures - even measures which the uk itself argued for in the past are suddenly unacceptable and vetoed .
so you find the hapless uk minister for overseas development having to veto aid to rwanda which she believes in . what a position for any government to put its own ministers in !
i say to the uk government that enough is enough is enough !
we have had the partial lifting of the ban which i welcome .
i was glad to hear commissioner fischler 's statement .
it is time now for the uk to say this phase is over .
they must re-think very seriously .
die bild-zeitung reproduced an article from the sun which gave its readers twenty ways to annoy the germans , would you believe !
one of them was to burn the german flag and to send the ashes to chancellor kohl .
what sort of message is this to be sending across europe , in particular when england is to host the euro 96 football competition which will produce all kind of tensions ?
i say to the house that the uk government has unleashed a tiger .
it will regret this and all of us in this house certainly deplore these activities .
there is , however , some good news .
that is the verdict of the scottish voters on this anti-european hysteria which has been whipped up by the conservative government .
the scottish farmers are very worried .
i spoke to one this morning who said they had given up hope .
he said the crisis was supposed to be about helping the beef farmers - the aberdeen angus area which i represent - and they were getting absolutely nothing .
some farmers have benefited but some have lost business and received no compensation .
the beef farmers are asking where the action is to follow the rhetoric .
they are not at all impressed by what they have heard from michael forsyth , the secretary of state for scotland who controls the scottish agriculture minister .
i trust that he will be sufficiently touched by and sensitive to our legitimate questions not to confirm that decision on 10 june , whatever the political consequences may be .
to err is human , but to persist in error is another matter .
mr santer also told us that his only regret was that it had been necessary to wait six weeks in order to find a solution , alibi , compromise .
six weeks to make sure that the experts were infallible .
six weeks to make sure that the gates of paradise were open to all , to take an economic decision against the interests of nature .
commissioner , do you think that is reasonable ?
if your heart fails to rule your head today , fear will soon do so .
while we wait for that inevitable day , for which you will accept responsibility , let us stop expecting the worst and start hoping for the best .
morale will benefit , and so will our health .
commissioner , can you conscientiously take the consumer hostage now that he is refusing to consume high-risk products , having felt they represented a danger to his health ?
can you , once again , leave it to european and national aid to make good lost revenue , soothe spirits and prevent liquidations and the resulting desertification of the rural environment ?
you are well aware that this aid will be criticized by observers of the european union 's agricultural financing .
we will not escape that criticism , and that goes for parliament too .
and , as always , the farmers will be in dock .
all that remains will be to dream up a system of compensation between production operations to make quite sure that farmers are divided on the subject .
everyone will lose out : the tax-payer through the state , the farmers through their professional solidarity , and the administrative machinery as far as its operation is concerned .
that is why my group opposes the lifting of the embargo and , consequently , will vote in favour of the resolution , provided it is amended .
mr president , the lifting of the export ban on beef derivatives is a significant step forward .
equally , i am pleased that the british government is at least showing some signs of constructive behaviour by apparently supporting the association agreement with slovenia .
that slightly modified stance needs to be taken much further .
the saddest aspect of this whole business is the way the british government has encouraged an unprecedented xenophobic , jingoistic rhetoric and practice .
surely such language has absolutely no place in the european union or in any civilized society .
the use of racist language and innuendo is a political tactic which will have a lasting and detrimental effect on both britain and the european union .
it must be our task as democrats and as parliamentarians to do all we can to end this crisis .
it must be our task to ensure that the ban is lifted .
it must be our task to help ensure that consumer confidence is restored as quickly as possible and to ensure that , above all else , jingoism is never , ever , heard again in the european union .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the cattle disease bse has not only provoked a crisis within the european union ; above all , it has led to a significant loss of consumer confidence .
anxious consumers mean a reduction in sales , and that in turn means lower prices for beef producers .
we are locked into a cycle here which has already produced unforeseeable effects and which we urgently need to bring under control .
but the best way for us to do that would be to restore confidence in european meat production .
we should therefore take a first step towards that goal by rigorously culling the bse-infected herds .
consumers must ultimately be able to find out where their meat comes from .
the danger at the present time is that hasty measures will be taken through force of circumstances and will sap consumer confidence still further .
this could be the case if the export ban were lifted without appropriate prior guarantees that the animalidentification system will work , for example , or that the ban on feeding with bone meal will not be contravened .
in addition , continuous monitoring by the eu will be necessary in future .
this is also the context in which the austrian position in the council should be seen , for at the present time we feel that the uncertainties are still too great .
it is in the interests of no-one to maintain an indefinite export ban on british cattle , but it is surely in the interests of everyone that safety and quality of supply should be ensured .
let us not only regard the current problems as a disaster but let us also see them as an opportunity to take the proper steps in the right direction .
mr president , i wish to restate here this morning my confidence in commissioner fischler 's handling of the bse crisis .
i welcome the partial lifting of the ban .
the decision is based on scientific evidence and will bring some movement in the beef sector which is very welcome at this time .
however , i urge the commission to bring to fruition the compensation package promised to beef producers .
i also restate my view that the compensation proposed is totally inadequate and must be immediately increased .
beef producers were already facing heavy financial losses before the bse crisis .
i regret that the overall impact of the crisis on consumers and farmers is not improving .
the latest statement , for example , by a british scientist that the disease is transmitted by cows to their unborn calves is creating further doubts in the minds of consumers .
where is it all going to end ?
there are people out there with all kind of agendas and nobody knows exactly where the truth lies .
we need urgently to concentrate on the public health considerations and what the position is there .
my understanding is that there is no proven health risk and surely it must be possible to have a factual and credible statement with regard to this .
in the meantime britain continues to treat the community with arrogance and contempt .
it created this problem and europe is now having to pay the price .
if consumer confidence is to be restored , britain must implement an eradication programme that will leave no doubts in the minds of consumers .
that is what the european community is committed to funding and it is not unreasonable to expect a satisfactory response .
as i have stated here on previous occasions , this crisis is having a greater impact on irish beef producers and on the irish economy than any other member state .
i would like to hear commissioner fischler this morning confirm the effectiveness of ireland 's control programme which has been in operation since the first case was identified a few years ago .
let me justify that assertion .
if i say that it is too soon for the ban on these three products to be lifted , i am not denying that there may be conditions under which a very high level of safety can be guaranteed .
but the fact remains that the conditions for lifting the ban at the present juncture have not yet been fulfilled .
but the mechanism has been thrown out of balance .
success has not yet been achieved , nor can we be certain that the three products are absolutely safe .
that is why the ban on these products has been lifted too soon !
the commission should know that it has , to some extent , been left holding the baby .
the commission should know that .
i believe we have really reached the point at which the bse crisis may become a crisis in the european union .
the british government has to take a considerable share of the blame - of that there is no doubt - but the actions of the commission and of some council members are fomenting this process .
where health is concerned there can be no half measures !
that is the foremost precept of the european union and surely also of the british government .
health is paramount .
nothing , but nothing , is anywhere near health in the list of priorities - just health , health and health again !
only then , well down the list , come national sentiments and national sensitivities .
that applies to the continent as well as to the british isles !
my fear is that the council and the commission are frittering away the trust of european people in the european union , and parliament should have no part in this squalid process !
mr president , the bse crisis is now ten weeks ' old .
it is the fruit of a reckless statement to the house of commons which had no scientific basis .
since then the european beef industry has been brought to its knees .
farmers , especially those in major exporting areas such as ireland , have suffered tremendous losses .
many are now close to bankruptcy .
consumer confidence in beef has been severely undermined and consumption levels have declined by anything up to 30 % .
we now need immediate and well-focused action to restore consumer confidence and eradicate the bse disease .
in the last few days , following many meetings , including briefings from uk ministers , we have seen some positive developments .
the british government now assures us that the rules on the disposal of offal and contaminated feed have been strengthened , are being rigorously enforced and are now watertight .
at last the british government has produced a fairly detailed programme for the eradication of bse .
although this document is far from perfect it is going in the right direction .
in addition the commission has produced a new programme to compensate farmers for some of their losses .
there are , however , some negative developments .
the british decision to disrupt community business is wrong .
it is counterproductive and it has made a bad situation very much worse .
it is bad for britain , bad for europe and will only prolong the crisis .
this display of lawlessness at the highest level of government is unacceptable in a union based on the rule of law and solidarity .
this is a lesson in how not to resolve conflict within the eu .
the other major downside is that ten weeks have gone by arguing about peripheral issues such as the ban on derivatives while ignoring the real fears of consumers and the plight of beef producers .
in areas such as ireland farming incomes have been decimated through no fault of the farmers concerned .
the british government has failed since 1989 to recognize the gravity of the situation .
we are now reaping the harvest of its inaction .
it must now sit down with the commission and examine the eradication programme and adopt a set of measures to eradicate bse and restore consumer confidence .
consumers must once again be convinced that beef is a wholesome food .
the current diet of misinformation and distorted facts must cease .
the challenge for all of us now is to demonstrate to consumers that the british government has finally become serious about the eradication of bse and it must now go about the task with commitment and determination .
finally , the commission must urgently re-examine the proposed compensation package for beef farmers .
any help is welcome but the current package will have to be substantially increased if it is to address the real losses to the people involved .
mr president , lord plumb is an able advocate - nobody denies that .
he told us movingly about the work going on in the uk to deal with bse .
sadly he omitted to tell us how the mess was caused in the first place .
he did not tell us who was responsible , who had been reckless with consumer interests and who had been reckless with the health interests of the population in the last fifteen years .
however , not even lord plumb 's advocacy - mr de vries will be very happy to hear this - can save the british conservative party from their own fate at the hands of the political equivalent of bse .
only a programme of electoral culling can do that .
it is more than two and a half months since the british minister told the house of commons of the possible link between bse and cjd .
ten weeks later it is only this week that we have received a plan to deal with the problem .
incredibly , in spite of all the warnings , from here among other places , the government had no contingency plan when the minister made the statement in the house of commons .
now we have two ministers touring the capitals on what they call a charm offensive .
they do not include lord plumb because he is far too committed a european for that .
but two ministers - i am not sure , incidentally , which one is charm and which one is offensive - are touring the european capitals .
it is a bit like sending saddam hussein on a peace mission .
for what they are not doing is concentrating on the eradication of the disease , concentrating on issues of consumer health and consumer confidence .
in this parliament we need to reorientate the debate to concentrate on public health , to recognize that there are still mysteries surrounding this disease .
we do not know about transmissibility and we do not really know about its origins .
far too much of this debate and far too many of these concerns have been hidden behind a shroud of secrecy in the council and elsewhere .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the working group on agriculture of the european people 's party held a hearing in february 1991 in the presence of mr meldrum from the royal veterinary institute in london .
as a consequence of that hearing , the european parliament adopted a resolution on 12 march 1991 urging the british government to ban human and animal consumption of beef from herds suspected of carrying bse .
in the years that followed parliament adopted further resolutions .
there was virtually no response from the british government .
mr meldrum told us in 1991 that the feeding to ruminants of bone meal from infected carcasses had been prohibited in 1988 and that by 1993 - five years after the prohibition - the disease would be eradicated .
sadly , commissioner , things worked out differently ; the disease has survived , and farmers can only look on helplessly as the greatest of all food scares deters consumers from beef consumption .
carelessness and ignorance have prevented resolute and timely action to eliminate the disease .
in this way the british government has put its own farmers and its own consumers in a critical economic situation as well as endangering their health .
this situation has now affected the whole of europe .
farmers and consumers are deeply disappointed at the ineptitude of the british administration !
( applause ) the protection of health takes priority over the lifting of the export ban , as mr santer said yesterday .
the decision to buy a product is taken by the consumer .
the consumer wants to know where gelatine and tallow , as products or as ingredients in other products , come from and whether they are harmless .
i ' m telling you that straight !
( laughter , applause ) to combat a swine-fever epidemic in germany and in belgium , hundreds of thousands of healthy pigs were put down .
the farmers were up in arms , but they were not asked .
only when it was officially established that the disease had been eradicated was the export ban lifted in both countries .
only then could free trading be resumed .
if we did not have the single market , the british government would be left to carry the can for this whole debacle .
mr president , i think the attitude of the united kingdom on this question is not only regrettable but fundamentally reprehensible .
in a community based on the rule of law such as the european union it seems that there can be no justification for pressurization and such blocking tactics as we have seen .
that attitude might - though i hope that it will not - sway the member states , and even of the commission , but in no circumstances could it help to restore consumers ' confidence .
it therefore seems to us essential that the commission should place all the information available before the european parliament and before public opinion .
we also need close commission monitoring of the measures taken by the united kingdom .
we think it is important that the commission , after examining the united kingdom 's measures , should see that they are strictly complied with so that they may be effective .
only that will really help to restore consumers ' confidence .
it seems to us that such changes do not help to restore consumers ' confidence either .
finally i should like to put a specific question to the commissioner : has the resignation of a highly-placed spanish official in the directorate general for agriculture anything to do with this matter ?
that is all very well and we support these measures , although we might have wished they had been taken some years earlier so that the problem could have been stopped before reaching its present scale .
here the union 's solidarity in the face of this serious crisis is demonstrated .
one member was saying that in a similar matter - african horse sickness - her country was left to cope alone , and that should not be the position either .
the ban is to be lifted on trade in gelatine , tallow and semen .
as regards the first two - gelatine and tallow - we are speaking of cosmetics , food , soft drinks , chocolates , sweets , sausages , doughnuts and so on .
it seems , according to what the commissioner has just said , that technically control by sterilization methods is guaranteed .
but i have my doubts about semen since the measures we have heard about , such as sterilization , as the word indicates , would leave it useless .
commissioner , the health of consumers is the first consideration .
we must not play with these things .
we must control the problem we are speaking of and above all follow things up in the country of origin to prevent possible escalation of the problem at union level .
mr president , in everyday life if not in european politics the penalty for blackmail is imprisonment .
the british government , which is blocking all european decisions in order to obtain the abolition of the ban on tallow , gelatine and bulls ' semen , is rewarded by having its demands met .
so no-one must be surprised if it acquires a taste for that and continues with its policy of blackmail .
now it has already announced that it will continue blocking all european decisions until there is also an agreement on total abolition of the export ban on british meat .
the extent of the present crisis is clearly the product of thoughtless deregulation and maladministration on the part of the british government .
why has no publicity ever been given to that import ban , commissioner fischler ?
why has that never been contested as import bans are normally contested ?
mr president , i would like colleagues to focus on what we do now and next week .
this is an appalling problem , it can be solved and the resolution of it lies in our own hands .
we now have an eradication plan on the table and the derivatives ban has been lifted , courtesy of the courage and persistence of commissioner fischler .
yesterday , president santer asked for a de-escalation of the british policy of non-cooperation with europe .
last night he got it from the british foreign secretary in rome , announcing that we would not veto the association with slovenia .
what we need to do now is concentrate on establishing a framework for the progressive lifting of the main ban .
the british government is not asking for dates , it is not asking for anything to be taken on trust ; it is asking merely for the establishment of a framework .
that can and should be delivered .
it would be easier for it to be delivered if people abandoned some of the rhetorical tricks they have been using this morning .
this is not clever , what we need is a resolution of this problem and that means an early negotiation of a framework .
if colleagues in this house start quoting the poisonous drivel from the sun and attributing it , however indirectly as mr macartney was doing , to the actions of a party they oppose , that is dangerous .
it sticks and plays precisely to the nationalist demon that lurks in all countries and in all parties .
i beg us all not to do that and concentrate on completing a perfectly simple negotiation on the framework for raising this ban over time when it becomes scientifically justified .
mr president , i am sure you will join me in thanking the commission for their continued effort towards finding a solution to the on-going crisis in the beef industry .
only through dialogue will solutions be found which are satisfactory to all those who , through no fault of their own , have become involved .
it is in the interest of all parties and member states to ensure that consumer and animal health throughout the community are safeguarded and we have a responsibility to do so .
for that reason i wholeheartedly agree with mr collins who has pointed out that a number of questions remain unanswered .
for example , questions about epidemiology and transmissibility .
the urgent need for increased and coordinated research has so far been largely ignored as efforts have been concentrated on emergency solutions to a crisis situation which should have been avoided .
not only must we also establish an information programme for consumers but the means should be made available to answer the questions that need to be answered before consumer confidence is restored .
the final point i would like to make is one which i have made before and will continue to make .
whilst i welcome the aid package which has been proposed by the commission , assistance has only been extended to farmers and the slaughter industry .
the plight of others is being ignored .
to date , 36 , 000 people in the united kingdom , employed in the beef industry , have lost their jobs and many others are likely to do so .
some of those people are with us today in the visitors ' gallery .
the united kingdom recently handed back ecu 200m , which was earmarked for the agricultural processing industry , to the commission .
i call upon the united kingdom government to spend that money for the purpose it was intended ; to help those employed in rural industry .
i urge the commission and parliament to ensure that they do so .
our task is to bring an end to the crisis for all those affected and not , as the british government seem to be doing , continue down paths which deepen rather than solve problems .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to deal very briefly with some of the interventions we have heard , because i think it is important to spell out the basis of the commission 's deliberations .
moreover , i believe the situation is serious enough without the addition of any distorted representations , which i should like to dispel .
with regard to bulls ' semen , i was asked where there had been a scientific decision or recommendation on this matter .
i believe that this constitutes a clear recommendation , and we have acted upon it .
and by the way , mr funk , we too are shrewd enough to work out that we cannot sterilize bulls ' semen if it is to achieve its intended purpose !
among other things , item 3 of article 1c states that , after consulting the member states in the framework of the standing veterinary committee , the commission will determine when dispatching can begin .
in other words , the date from which tallow and gelatine may actually be exported again has not even been set .
i therefore marvel at all those who already know that the ban is being lifted too soon .
i believe we must remain consistent and logical here , otherwise we run the risk of not being taken seriously .
i was also asked how further controls will be organized once the first checks have taken place .
one thing is already clear to all of us in the commission : the health and safety of consumers must be the supreme imperative .
these intervention measures , of course , primarily help the processing industry ; they also help the abattoirs and those who work there .
fifty thousand tonnes of intervention stocks cost ecu 120 million .
in april and may alone we bought up 115 000 tonnes of intervention stocks and have just put a further intervention of 50 000 tonnes out to tender .
all of these measures added together naturally produce a considerably higher amount , more than double the 650 million debated here .
i should also like to add that we have three more projects in the pipeline .
but one thing is clear .
we must surmount these acute difficulties now .
the debate is closed .
i have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .
the vote will take place at 11 a.m .
financial services and movement of natural persons
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this report outlines the results of the wto negotiations on financial services and on movement of natural persons in the framework of the multilateral trading system .
the gatt agreement signed in 1994 by 76 contracting parties had hitherto applied only to trade in goods and has now been supplemented by a general agreement on trade in services ( gats ) .
in december 1994 the european parliament gave its assent to the results of the uruguay round .
gats is an integral part of the legal framework of the multilateral trading system .
it covers the entire range of services , including financial services .
as is the case with trade in goods , the basic principles are those of most-favoured-nation treatment and national treatment .
it was clear from the very beginning that services markets could only be opened up in stages .
the commitments arrived at in the uruguay round therefore represent an initial , in some cases cautious , step towards the liberalization of trade in services and need to be supplemented by further negotiating rounds .
with regard to the overall content , it may be said that in many participating countries the business prospects for foreign banks have been improved .
financial institutions and insurers can upgrade their operations , either through branches on the spot or through cross-border transactions .
the attitude of the united states remains disappointing .
several u.s. withdrawals from various negotiations in recent times makes one wonder where u.s. trade policy is headed .
although not all the results of these negotiations have lived up to our expectations , we can still give our assent to the results as a whole .
and i do mean ' assent ' literally .
the commission had proposed that parliament merely be consulted on the conclusion of the negotiations , a proposal based on the first subparagraph of article 228 ( 3 ) of the ec treaty .
it would be illogical if assent procedure were not applied in this case .
whoever gives assent to a procedure is also entitled to give assent to any subsequent changes in the procedure .
i believe this represents an inadmissible attempt to curtail the rights of the european parliament .
the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights , which was consulted on this report and delivered its opinion , endorses our position and also pleads the case for assent procedure .
we are grateful to the draftsman , mrs schaffner , for her report .
i should like to conclude by making a few remarks on the timescale within which the european parliament has had to deal with this matter .
the negotiations were completed at the end of last july .
the results are to enter into force no later than 30 july of this year .
following the end of negotiations it took nine months for the commission proposal to be tabled and a total of ten months before it was referred to parliament .
it is neither comprehensible nor acceptable that it took so long to draw up a 16-page proposal , with the result that parliament has had scarcely more than a month to discuss it .
how can a proper balanced process of parliamentary deliberation be implemented under these circumstances ?
the fact that we have managed to do this and to subject the proposal to serious examination is due to the speed at which the committee on external economic relations has been working .
i should like to thank all of my fellow members for helping to put this through so quickly .
let me say to the commission and the council that this highly disrespectful treatment of parliament cannot be tolerated or accepted much longer .
i ask the house to approve this report .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , in this case , as so often these days , we have good news and bad news .
the good news is that the proposal was referred to parliament and the committee at all .
our thanks go to the commission for that .
the first reason is that it is the extension of a treaty - gatt - to which we had to give our assent .
it is the logical sequel and the logical consequence of this that all further negotiations resulting from the treaty should be subject to parliamentary assent as a matter of course .
the second reason is that gats is an international agreement , and international agreements are now referred to us .
there is another piece of good news , thanks once again to the commission .
this is the second time i have thanked you today , because you have really done some excellent work .
you undoubtedly prevented the collapse of the talks during the negotiating rounds .
we know how difficult the americans were as negotiating partners , in the talks on the telecommunications element of gats as in other domains .
here too , you negotiated exceedingly well , for which i offer you our special thanks .
this should send a signal to the united states , urging it simply to regard liberalization as a philosophy that should be followed throughout the world .
the united states has almost always been the leading exponent of free trade , but now it is abandoning the principle wherever awkward situations arise , and that must not happen !
the americans really must see the process through and stop merely pushing national and regional interests .
that also applies , incidentally , to our debate on helms-burton .
i ask the united states to take this message to heart .
mr president , i rise with mixed feelings to speak in this debate as regards both the procedure and the substance .
we naturally welcome the fact that the council has consulted parliament on the agreement negotiated in the framework of the world trade organization .
but we are disappointed that the council has preferred the consultation procedure to the assent procedure .
we are also disappointed that once again the council is allowing parliament such a short time for giving its views .
that is becoming a habit .
it has taken some ten months for the council to consult parliament .
now parliament has very few weeks if the date on which the agreement takes effect is to be observed .
as regards the substance i shall be very brief .
i refer to our colleague mr kittelmann 's excellent report .
but i should like to express the hope that the concessions in opening up the markets will increase the commercial opportunities for banks , financial institutions and insurance companies .
it is a pity that the united states has felt unable to take part in the agreement .
that will not perhaps have any dramatic effects as regards our relations with the united states , but it undeniably reduces the credibility of the world trade organization .
in conclusion i should like to say this : parliament must be consulted according to the assent procedure whenever agreements concerning the world trade organization are involved .
that is moreover the view of the committee on legal affairs too .
we may therefore hope that parliament will accept mr kittelman 's two amendments contained in his report .
finally one last observation .
parliament must protect its institutional position not only within the european union but also within the world trade organization .
i think parliament must therefore do everything necessary in order to be represented by a delegation at the ministerial conference in singapore in december next .
it would be inconceivable if parliament were unable to attend .
mr president , the agreement on financial services was adopted almost a year ago and has only now been referred to parliament , shortly before the deadline .
we know that it had been a bone of contention for years .
we know that many developing countries had very serious objections to this agreement and to one-sided liberalization of trade in services in general .
among their objections was the fact that , although the agreement was intended to create freedom of movement for major banks and insurance companies , it contained no provisions on the free movement of persons .
a concession has since been made to the developing countries , but this does not alter the fundamental issue .
we also know that the united states has not acceded to this agreement , so a major international trading nation is missing .
what we do not know , however , is how this agreement will affect employment in europe and in the third world .
the wto is conducting secret diplomacy , and the european commission seems bent on outdoing it for secrecy .
not even the competent parliamentary committee was duly informed .
two years ago we were already sounding warnings to the effect that the wto would mean less democratic control by parliaments and citizens .
to rush through in this way , without time for careful scrutiny , an agreement with such far-reaching implications for people 's lives cannot be justified to the voters who gave us our parliamentary mandates .
that is why we shall not vote for this agreement .
nor can i share the euphoria about the liberalization of world trade that is prevalent in parts of this house .
on the contrary , i fear that if we continue to pursue this ambition we shall liberalize ourselves to death .
mr president , the liberalization of services would be a significant step towards the worldwide liberalization of trade if the united states did not refuse to approve it .
the agreement that was achieved certainly offers easier access to new markets for european businesses .
that will have some beneficial effects , especially in the fast-growing markets of the developing and newly developed countries .
however , without the approval of the united states , which leads the field in international competition , the liberalization of service markets has been severely disrupted , to put it mildly .
when this decision is implemented , great care will also have to be taken to abide by the principles of mostfavoured nation treatment and national treatment .
otherwise the agreement could very quickly turn out to be an exercise in self-deception .
liberalization also presupposes scrupulous observance of the legal provisions governing the capital and liquid resources of financial service enterprises .
the point that this council proposal would have benefited from better cooperation and above all from parliamentary assent has already been adequately expounded .
as you all know , in july 1995 , the european community made a decisive contribution to the conclusion of these negotiations .
the excellent results obtained under the community 's leadership have confirmed europe 's position in the world trade organization , which will need to be further consolidated in the future .
the proposal for a council decision , which confirms the commitments made by the community , is the final step in these negotiations .
the deadline for acceptance of the legal instruments implementing our commitments is fixed for the end of this month .
here i must sincerely apologize for the fact that the proposal for a council decision has been presented to you at a relatively late stage .
this was principally due to the various procedural stages , such as the legal verification of the timetable for the commitments which we had go through in geneva .
as i have already said , the council decision , proposed by the commission , will allow the community to confirm the results of the geneva negotiations .
i wish to specify clearly that none of these commitments involves any amendment to the acts or legislation in force in the community but simply reflect the current degree of liberalization on its territory , without going any further .
the co-decision procedure under article 189b , mentioned in the kittelmann report , applies only when an international agreement gives rise to the amendment of an act adopted according to the procedures provided for in that article .
this does not apply in the present case , so article 189b cannot be invoked .
i also want to clarify some points that were made on the connection between the conclusion of this negotiation and the results of the uruguay round .
the uruguay round package presupposes the creation of a new institutional framework with binding legal rules and disciplines .
the assent of the european parliament was asked for on that basis .
that is how the world trade organization was created and is now operating .
but the position here is different : as the introduction of a new institutional framework or new rules and disciplines was not provided for , the criteria under article 228 ( 3 ) ( 1 ) do not apply .
finally i would like to emphasize , mr president , that the commission has thought long and hard about the type of opinion parliament should be asked for .
for the reasons i have just given we did not consider it appropriate to apply article 228 ( 3 ) ( 1 ) which provides specifically for assent .
so parliament is being asked to give its opinion on the basis of article 228 ( 3 ) ( 1 ) .
i conclude by emphasizing the need to take a decision rapidly to confirm the geneva results . we reiterate the importance of the role played by the european community and the commitment undertaken in this multilateral process .
recent developments demonstrate that the leadership of the european community is undeniably necessary .
here i would also like to express my thanks for the recognition accorded to the commission 's conduct of the negotiations .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 11 a.m .
votes
madam president , i would have liked to say a few brief words before voting began , because i have been somewhat surprised today by the turn that events have taken in this house .
i do not say that scientology is a dangerous sect .
i have my own opinion on the matter .
even so , i do find it a bit much for parliament to have authorized a meeting of this kind .
furthermore , i learned this morning that the meeting had been cancelled at the last moment .
so , madam president , i would like us to be a little more scrupulous when requests of this kind are received by parliament , and i would prefer us not to appear ridiculous in the eyes of outsiders .
i cannot tell you whether that meeting was really authorized or had simply been announced , but i am taking note of what you say .
that is why bilateral agreements between morocco and the european states concerned could usefully extend these relationships into the future .
on the other hand , the multilateral agreement between the european union and morocco which is before us today smacks of a project to globalize the economy , generating imbalances and destroying the roots of nations .
not only that , but this agreement is incompatible with the principle of national preference , which seems to us more important than ever .
i am thinking especially of national preference in employment , at a time when millions of men and women in france , as throughout europe , are the victims of unemployment .
that is why we voted against the von habsburg report , which reflects a policy of which we disapprove .
this general policy only serves , in the long run , the interests of a handful of multinationals and the globalist lobby .
i did not vote for the von habsburg report .
it is a most inappropriate time to make this agreement with morocco .
we have sacrificed our principles of defence of human rights on the altar of trade .
we have abandoned the people of the western sahara for this shoddy and shabby deal on trade .
therefore i cannot support this agreement .
madam president , i did not vote for this report either , along with numerous other austrian social democrats , because it effectively forestalls something that the world and europe have long awaited .
it is not as if the inhumanity and the escalation of the conflict with polisario had happened yesterday .
efforts to find a solution have been going on for years , and it is quite obviously the case that morocco has no interest in an amicable settlement .
nor are the human-rights violations a new phenomenon .
i am not prepared to pay the piper before he plays the tune .
madam president , it is because we would not wish on morocco something we reject for ourselves that we have not voted for the association agreement with that great country .
because , more and more , we are seeing the fateful effects for nations throughout the world of treaties inspired by the single notion of free trade .
so let us first put our own house in order , by breaking with the single-track thinking and totalitarian methods worthy of the brave new world , before we start giving lectures to the kingdom of morocco .
parliament earlier rejected ratification of the financial protocol between the eu and morocco precisely because of the moroccan government 's infringements of international law .
according to a report from amnesty international ( 18 april 1996 ) the moroccan security services are guilty of serious violations of human rights , in contravention of international human rights conventions which have been ratified by morocco .
another major problem is morocco 's systematic boycott of the process to implement the un security council 's resolutions that a free referendum should be held concerning the independence of western sahara .
the european union has a responsibility to help ensure that morocco develops into a stable and properly functioning parliamentary democracy which respects freedom of speech , freedom of organisation and the freedom of the press .
to enter into an association with morocco under present circumstances would mean going back on our demand that morocco should introduce real democracy and respect human rights .
for this reason we will vote against the report .
and without an association agreement there will be no fisheries agreement : we cannot have the sun shining on the threshing floor and rain on the turnips ...
the agreement is naturally based on a compromise between the contracting parties , which in our case , as far as portugal is concerned , brings constraints in the field of competition , particularly in the sardine processing sector .
this house has voted in favour of the association agreement between the european union and morocco , and i welcome that vote .
by making this gesture we have accepted the conclusions arrived at by mr von habsburg , and i congratulate him on his excellent work .
we all have at heart the process of renewal of the european union 's mediterranean policy , established by the barcelona conference .
in giving our assent , we are keeping faith with the desires we expressed .
this agreement will stimulate morocco to expedite the opening-up of its economy , with a view to a free trade area .
in addition , economic cooperation will be strengthened , with the aim of supporting and developing sectors that create jobs .
that leaves the matter of human rights , an argument of which much has been made by the supporters of a ' no ' vote .
it is my deep-seated conviction that this question should be integrated into the actual philosophy of the association agreement .
we are giving a clear political signal to the moroccan authorities to continue along the road towards liberalization , political as well as economic .
finally , let us also remember that the fisheries agreement has already received the assent of this house .
not to give our assent to the association agreement would have made no sense at all .
i voted in favour of giving parliament 's assent to the association agreement between the european union and the kingdom of morocco for several reasons .
this agreement is a consistent follow-up to the decisions taken at essen in 1994 and at cannes in 1995 by the european summits of heads of state and government of the european union .
it is the third agreement of this kind signed within the framework of the union 's mediterranean policy , following the eu / tunisia and eu / israel agreements .
on the financial side , this agreement is covered until 1999 by the credits allocated within the framework of the meda programme .
last but not least , i voted in favour because morocco has since 1990 been evolving slowly but surely towards political democratization and respect for human rights .
a number of instruments have , indeed , already been established since that date .
february 1991 : limitation of the period for which people can be held in police custody or preventive detention ;
the agreement now approved has in itself some good aspects ; it will bring the people of morocco closer to europe and will have the effect of bringing europe closer to the people of morocco .
we have always been and shall always be in favour of an agreement with morocco .
above all , it is worth repeating , because of the way in which europe protected ( or rather did not protect ) one of its members .
we are sure that the kingdom of morocco will see the importance of the way we have voted and that the european union will understand it .
farassino report
we regard the design and issuing of driving licences as a matter for national governments , not only in the eu but throughout the world .
there is no need for a special eu driving licence .
the principle laid down in article 1 of directive 91 / 439 / eec concerning mutual recognition of national driving licences is entirely sufficient .
in view of the above we are voting against the report .
this directive has been improved considerably since the first reading .
i am therefore voting for it .
however , i regard the whole idea of an obligatory common driving licence for the different countries of the union to be wrong .
each country should have the right to decide for itself on the design of driving licences .
the directive will only give rise to unnecessary change-over costs in the member states .
adoption of the common driving licence model should at least be voluntary .
marinucci recommendation
i want to express my support and that of the green group for the marinucci report on the proposal to amend the regulation establishing life .
the fact that the common position took up a large number of the amendments proposed by parliament at first reading is a positive sign .
i hope the commission will support the point of view of the european parliament 's committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection .
i only wish to repeat what i said in my speech during first reading .
i have no doubt that the amendment will be accepted as the commission told us in the previous debate .
i shall therefore vote in favour .
parodi report
the commission 's communication on the common transport policy action programme 1995-2000 has many serious failings from the environmental point of view .
the proposed green paper on the internalisation of external costs and citizens ' networks is a positive element , however .
the committee on transport and tourism describes transport and the trans-european networks as ' the basis for social , economic and cultural development ' .
it is against this background that we abstained in the final vote on the parodi report .
we have voted for the report and the amendments from the greens , including paragraph 41 , integrity , amendment no 12 by the green group .
i believe that the time zones which countries belong to and the summertimes they adopt are national matters where the principle of subsidiarity should apply .
i oppose the requirement that less state aid should be provided for rail transport while heavy goods vehicles do not have to pay their own environmental costs and state aid is provided for the construction of motorways .
it should be possible for the requirement concerning emergency telephones along european motorways to be modified in accordance with the extremely low traffic density which exists in northern scandinavia , in order to avoid unreasonable costs being incurred .
a common rule on the maximum permitted blood alcohol level is desirable but i would like it to be possible for stricter national requirements to be applied , as well as a zero level for all drugs .
i should also like to observe that support for airports in thinly populated areas , at the expense of big airports , following the swedish model , should be allowed to continue .
for the rest , i welcome the proposals concerning environmental adjustment put forward by the rapporteur .
i would stress that changing over to a transport system more suited to the environment is of the utmost importance if european industry is not to fall behind .
it is true that the european parliament has on several occasions called , unsuccessfully , for genuine fiscal and social harmonization .
i believe the problems i have just mentioned are of quite crucial importance for safety , and indeed for the improvement of road safety .
since mr parodi 's report virtually avoids this subject , i feel obliged to abstain in the vote , although certain other proposals made by mr parodi seem to me to be acceptable .
plooij-van gorsel report
as i did not have the opportunity to speak when the report was debated in plenary i would now like to give an explanation of vote on the subject .
i believe greater emphasis should have been placed on the waste which partly accounts for the administrative costs of 13 % .
corresponding costs in normal research programmes are between 2 % and 3 % .
where future research programmes are concerned we must make sure that stringent measures are taken to keep down administrative costs .
in the research world it is generally acknowledged that bureaucracy and high costs are typical of eu research programmes .
this state of affairs should be properly reviewed and appropriate measures taken .
argyros report
this report from the committee on research , technological development and energy constitutes an excellent analysis of the commission 's green paper on innovation .
three fundamental considerations in this report should be emphasized .
the first is that you cannot directly equate the concept of innovation with research and technological development since innovation must be regarded first and foremost as a function of the interplay between the technological supply and demand .
innovation involves to a very high degree the application of technology in production and the life of the community .
the other consideration is that to strengthen innovation as a means of improving the international competitiveness of european industry presupposes a more rapid availability and utilization of the results of research and technological development .
pompidou report
for the same reason it is also the first time the question has been raised in the european parliament and the council of ministers .
so far as choosing the form of cooperation is concerned the rapporteur discusses three possible models for cooperation , namely association , bilateral cooperation and cooperation with technological assistance .
non-admission of croatia to the council of europe
madam president , the fact that croatia is not being admitted to the council of europe on the pretext of a supposed absence of press freedom really is a peak of parliamentary hypocrisy .
because , after all , who would venture to claim that the press is freer in russia - to name but one instance - than it is in croatia ?
croatia had to conduct a heroic struggle for its independence before reestablishing its economy .
but it really is a bit rich to complain of that here , in this house , when , this evening , every channel in france is going to be broadcasting a single programme .
a single broadcast about aids , which seems to be regarded as the only illness worthy of sympathy , a hundred times more so than cancer or muscular dystrophy or all the other illnesses put together .
what strange exclusive criterion , what strange variety of racism treats such things as acceptable at home but criticizes them in croatia ?
the votes of some members may also reflect a delayed reaction to croatian independence , which some groups accepted reluctantly .
this , however , would be the wrong way to lead a country scarred by years of communist dictatorship and by civil war towards the western european fold .
for that reason we reject this resolution .
extraordinary council meeting
at first sight this may seem a difficult line to follow , but if we fail to follow it for the sake of simplicity we risk regretting it bitterly in a few years ' time .
so let us act responsibly .
and acting responsibly includes analysing the underlying causes of the crisis and implementing the essential remedies to ensure that it does not recur elsewhere .
first , let us acknowledge that mad cow disease is the result of unnatural agricultural practices , embarked upon in a mad race for world market prices .
this deplorable approach is now engraved on the heart of the new common agricultural policy .
unless we undertake a radical change in direction , we must be prepared for other mad cows , or worse , in future years .
after all , it is quite possible that the chaotic state of frontier controls has facilitated the fraudulent importing of contaminated meat or cattle feeds into mainland europe .
that , they will tell us , is what the treaties say .
well , our answer to that is that the treaties are absurd .
this abdication of responsibility by the politicians in favour of civil servants dishonours the council and helps to explain much of what is wrong in europe .
madam president , in my view the british government is making itself look very silly in the present circumstances .
however , i regret that today 's resolution was a very substantial change from the resolution we passed on 28 march .
now we seem to be supporting the ban rather than being an interested , neutral observer .
i would rather we have maintained the position whereby we were an observer of the ban rather than a supporter of the ban .
a few nights ago i was in my hotel room watching german television .
i watched a programme on zdf and as a british citizen from a beef area i was appalled at the almost hysterical attack on the british beef industry in that programme .
i found some of the scenes quite distressing and quite offensive .
i have been very critical of the way the british press has been talking about our partners in europe in recent weeks .
i would ask that the continental media show some balance in the way in which they report the subject of bse .
but he is wrong legally , because what characterizes europe is error , and the responsibility for error , or at best objective responsibility , the responsibility for risk .
one british factory , the dunkester factory in yorkshire , by changing its manufacturing processes , has poisoned 156 , 000 british cattle to date , and a few others elsewhere in the world .
well , that is a matter of responsibility .
every human act that causes damage to another person obliges the party responsible for the error to put things right .
scientifically , mr hallam , you are right : the risk is exaggerated .
legally , you are wrong : the factories that caused the poisoning should have been held responsible for it .
i abstained on account of recital e , which recommends additional support for agriculture of several billion .
i consider current agricultural support to be wasteful and do not wish to contribute to further subsidies for this sector .
madam president , i voted against the resolution .
i should have expected the european parliament to signal far more clearly that consumer protection and public health are not subordinated to economic interests in the european union .
the decision taken by the commission makes a mockery of consumer protection and public health .
the relaxation of the export ban at a time when more and more cases of creutzfeldt-jakob disease are coming to light can only lead one to conclude that such a decision is based on sheer cynicism .
the commission , the council and even , to an increasing extent , the european parliament are buckling under the blackmail tactics of the british government .
it is to be feared that the commission 's decision will pave the way for the complete lifting of the export ban .
i believe it is a totally misguided decision , because consumer protection and public health must take priority .
we must practise preventive health care .
as long as scientists cannot rule out a health risk , we must try to have the export ban maintained .
that should have been our aim .
i believe that this decision taken by the commission shows total disregard for consumer protection and public health in the european union .
that is why i regret that we did not adopt a more radical resolution .
that concludes voting time .
adjournment of the session
i declare adjourned the session of the european parliament .
( the sitting was closed at 12.10 p.m. )
resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday , 6 june 1996 .
ladies and gentlemen , in particular from the region concerned , have asked me to make a short statement on the bombing in manchester last saturday .
the ira bomb injured over two hundred people , many of them seriously ; it caused vast material damage to the centre of manchester .
it is almost a miracle that hundreds of people were not killed .
there is no possible or conceivable justification for the ira bomb .
the targets were ordinary men , women and children shopping , on saturday morning , in a busy city .
what possible cause could justify such barbarism ?
the european parliament expresses its sympathy for those injured by the bomb in manchester last saturday , and our hopes for their speedy and full recovery .
i am writing to the lord mayor of manchester to pass on this message to the injured and to their families .
i am sure that i speak for the whole house when i say that the cause of peace must not be abandoned because of intimidation by terrorists .
( applause ) terrorism can be defeated by the courage and steadfastness of communities and their leaders , to keep the peace process moving forward .
( applause )
mr president , as the member who represents the constituency where this terrible atrocity took place , i want to thank you for the comments you have made on behalf of all the house .
i know that my constituents , as all the colleagues here , share those views .
i simply wish to add a tribute to the members of the emergency services whose prompt and professional actions saved many lives .
without those actions there would indeed have been a terrible mass murder .
this was the largest explosion of its kind on mainland britain since the second world war .
we should be very thankful that , despite the efforts of the bombers , at least no-one died .
but terrible damage has been caused and we all share your condemnation of this atrocious act .
in the circumstances of the peace process there is no justification for this , or in any other circumstances for that matter .
i endorse your view that this house must support in every possible way the peace process .
i appeal to the men of violence to lay down their arms , to stop their murderous acts of violence in ireland and elsewhere .
again , mr president , thank you for your statement .
welcome
ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of parliament , i wish to welcome 40 honorary consuls who have taken their seats in the official gallery .
they are members of the federation of consuls in europe , which is holding its annual meeting here at the european parliament .
you are very welcome !
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents at its meeting of 13 june 1996 pursuant to rule 95 of the rules of procedure has been distributed .
mr president , i should like to give an account of something that happened recently and ask the presidency about it .
last friday a demonstration was held in brussels by a trade union representing metal workers and its route passed close to the european parliament buildings in rue belliard .
according to the huissiers they were not members of the european parliament 's internal security forces nor could they have been , given what they were doing .
nor were they visitors .
who were these people filming the demonstrators ?
were they police officers ?
if so , who authorised their activity ?
can you give me any information on this matter , mr president ?
could you please just put your headphones on , mr novo .
firstly , you may have heard me announce that the next item was the order of business .
i could not see that what you were saying had anything to do with the order of business .
secondly , you can send your comments to me in writing , and i shall look into the matter .
you will also then receive a reply .
for this week , there are no amendments .
on the july part-session in brussels :
for wednesday , 3 july 1996 , i have a request from the group of the party of european socialists for the report by mr pelttari on the bioethics convention to be postponed .
the pse group is asking for this report to be postponed to the second part-session in july .
the exact date will have to be fixed by the group chairmen , since we cannot decide that here , but we can of course decide on the postponement .
since no one wishes to speak in favour of or against the request , i put it to the vote .
( parliament approved the request ) the order of business is thus established .
deadline for tabling amendments and motions for resolutions
mr president , as you know , we have a discussion and a resolution on the summit meeting on florence .
part of that , according to most groups i imagine , will be to make some sort of statement from this house on the british government 's policy of non-cooperation in europe .
perhaps we could hold the deadline on just that single issue until 11 a.m. or noon tomorrow to enable our resolution to be up-to-date and to make sense .
the services responsible are signalling to me that this is technically feasible .
if the house has no objections , we shall proceed accordingly .
mr president , i should like to pass on some information .
this house , last july and again in december passed a resolution on foreign lecturers in italy .
we were particularly concerned about the plight of the naples 88 who had been sacked due to a breach of community law .
you , mr president , the chairman of the committee on social affairs , employment and the working environment and mr newman in the committee on petitions took the matter up .
i am very pleased to inform you that on friday all 88 at naples got their jobs back and their back-pay .
i think this is a significant victory for us in the european parliament .
( applause )
thank you , mr mcmahon .
we too are glad to hear good news .
framework programmes for r & d
the next item is the report ( a4-0183 / 96 ) by mr linkohr , on behalf of the committee on research , technological development and energy , on :
mr president , if you permit , i shall speak on behalf of my honourable friend rolf linkohr , who is unable to attend this sitting for medical reasons , for which i pass on his apologies .
at the same time i shall crave your indulgence , because i am having to stand in for him more or less at a moment 's notice .
and the latter , sadly , will be the main topic of our debate this evening and , most probably , tomorrow in our contacts and inevitable conciliation efforts with the council .
that decision of 26 april 1994 effectively set the overall amount for the fourth framework programme at ecu 12 300 .
it is a proposal intended from the very outset as a compromise .
in any event we shall proclaim it loud and clear in our future contacts .
mr president , i am presenting this opinion on behalf of my colleague , mr van velzen .
the committee is calling on the commission to set up intersectoral and interdisciplinary task forces , and to involve european industry as closely as possible in drawing up research topics , so as to avoid a top-down approach .
the criteria and data for selecting task forces must be made transparent ; in particular , a comparative assessment of the benefits of the task forces should be presented after a certain period of experience .
according to the commission 's proposals , as much as 55 % of the ecu 700 million - in other words , ecu 385 million - was to be assigned to transport issues .
the committee on transport has consequently tabled an amendment of its own , amendment no 60 , which reinstates at least the intermodality task force , and with a suitable appropriation .
we must in fact recognize that interoperability is an inherently european topic .
for example , we have five different railway gauges in europe , and we wonder why many hours are wasted changing engines .
time is not wasted in this way with lorries .
it is also a matter here of increasing competitiveness in the european union , whereas the car sector , for example , can readily be tackled at national level .
to my mind , interoperability is the european topic par excellence .
the two largest political groups have tabled a compromise proposal with a somewhat reduced appropriation ; the committee on transport and tourism hopes that this compromise will meet with the approval of the house .
i know that we are to discuss the funding separately , but our inclusion of this title shows clearly the direction in which european transport policy needs to move .
mr president , it is a great pity that rolf linkohr is not with us this evening for the presentation of this report .
i would like to congratulate him on the quality of the work he has done .
the explanatory statement is a very valuable document and i hope colleagues will take the trouble to study it .
we have had a lot of difficulties with this report , on the whole question of how much money we should go for and over what period of time , and what the role of the taskforces should be .
i should like to say on behalf of the socialist group that this is the path that we wish to follow .
the report is subject to the co-decision procedure and we must have a majority in parliament .
i hope that , although most of us have reservations about the report as it emerged from committee , we will support it .
we have the task ahead of making sure that we can put a convincing case to the council for increased research activity at european level .
we are still falling behind and i hope we will take this lesson , if no other , to heart this evening and make sure we argue this case very strongly with the council of ministers .
i just want to mention a couple of items .
one , the increased funding for bse research .
this is very topical and , if nothing else , it shows the importance of having a bit more flexibility in our programmes .
it would be a real tragedy if we had to wait three , four or five years before we can change the direction of some of our research , simply because we are locked into a rigid five-year programme .
that lesson is one we need to learn .
we need to look also at the question of the safety of nuclear reactors .
we are all agreed that we need to do more work in these areas : the decontamination of affected areas and the radiation protection programme .
i hope these matters will have strong support in the house tomorrow .
we are dealing , as mrs quisthoudt has said , with the issue - which might be described as being experimental in nature - fundamental to the development of the fifth framework programme that will soon be with us .
in conclusion , i believe that by approving the linkohr report tomorrow , we shall be giving the council a strong signal that the house wants to move in that direction europe 's research strategy for the future .
it also interferes with the current programme structure .
there are a number of subjects which my group recognizes as extremely important for europe and its citizens .
information and communications technologies are vital for the future of europe , and are areas where rapid changes are taking place .
future workers are going to have to learn about telematics , and this is why the task force on educational multimedia is such a good idea .
multimedia products need to be developed for and used in schools .
a good example here is the uk , whose schools have made much more progress in using information technologies than those in other eu countries .
secondly , small and medium-sized firms must be able to participate fully in the fourth programme .
the framework programme has taught industrial firms in europe how to work together , and this is something we must not jeopardize .
mr president , in the process of reorienting europe 's productive activity to meet the demands of the globalization of the world economy , research and technological development play a crucial role .
the group of the european united left-nordic green left disagrees with the commission proposal and agrees with mr linkohr 's report , whilst recognizing that it does have some shortcomings .
we therefore welcome the fact that mr linkohr has incorporated into his report our amendments concerning the elderly and health care - areas which will present the most urgent problems in the coming years .
there should also be a concern to promote a model of sustainable development .
for these reasons , we reject the commission proposal and support mr linkohr 's report , acknowledging the efforts made by the rapporteur .
mr president , in times of recession , one should actually be welcoming an increase of ecu 700 million for the fourth framework programme of activities in the field of research .
research and development must receive financial backing , but the focus has to be right .
and , in our opinion , the focus no longer is right .
i should like to explain this by taking some examples .
secondly , the money is to be spent on the so-called inherently safe reactor , something which does not and cannot exist , and for which there is no acceptance among the general public .
moreover , as mr scapagnini has quite rightly said , research funds always go to major industry and not to smes , which could really do with them .
another case in point is that , according to the proposal from the commission , ecu 150 m was to be made available for the save ii programme .
but huge sums of money are to be spent on aeronautics and fusion and other such gimmicks .
my second example concerns thermie .
no one mentions thermie ii any more , another programme which has become absolutely vital .
we hear every day that co2 levels are rising .
and now some clever people are saying that the cause is our opposition to nuclear power plants .
what nonsense !
having looked at the oecd statistics , i note that countries with a particularly large number of nuclear power stations do not have lower co2 emissions .
in fact , this phenomenon is caused primarily by traffic , which is not being taken into account at all .
mr president , thank you for allowing this exception .
on behalf of my group , i should like to highlight three important points , and firstly the amount of the increase : ecu 700 million .
even though savings are now the order of the day in all the member states and at eu level , we believe that there is an urgent need to invest in the future .
and this can only be done through innovation , the basis for which is research and development .
that is why we have endorsed this overall sum .
secondly , we agree with the green paper on innovation that the dissemination and exploitation of results must be improved .
we have taken this into account in our amendment on the allocation of resources .
even though money is not all that is needed here , it certainly does help !
thirdly , we are in fact in a transitional phase , in the middle of the fourth framework programme .
the discussion has in some cases been unusually heated , however , due to the fact that the thrust of the research topics was altered in an over-hasty way .
we hope that the consultation process in preparation for the fifth framework programme will be smoother and more relaxed .
as gordon adam has already said , we do need an absolute majority in parliament .
for that reason , there has been a strong desire in the house to reach an agreement , and this is reflected in our compromise proposals .
it is most important to increase the safety of the nuclear power stations located , in particular , in the countries of the former eastern bloc and in china .
but another chernobyl-type accident would be extremely dangerous for us too .
that is why , for reasons of solidarity as well as our own safety , it is imperative for us to contribute and expand our practical help and know-how regarding accident prevention .
however , it is not acceptable that a covert or overt extension of the use of nuclear energy should be pushed through by these means .
many people are in fact in favour of abandoning this fundamentally uncontrollable technology , and we should like to see a move into the age of solar power .
that is the most we can possibly accept , and even that demands something of an effort from us , because in structural terms , even safety upgrades are an incentive to keep dangerous nuclear plants in service .
in principle , this means that the life-span of the plant and technology of a conventional nuclear power station is likely to be extended by a further 40 years .
in this way , for example , not only is the latest nuclear technology to be introduced at sosnovy bor , but the decommissioning of the grafenrheinfeld nuclear power station in germany is to be avoided .
the result is a balanced and constructive motion for a resolution , which should enhance the quality of the debate between the institutions and make this decision easier to take .
i shall not presume on your attention for any longer than is necessary .
in view of the importance of the subject , however , i should like to make a few remarks on a number of points .
it was a wise decision . given the fact that it was launched over two years ago , the fourth programme does not satisfy all the needs that arise today .
these needs are more clearly apparent in certain domains .
priorities evolve .
mr adam referred to research into bse .
let me point out in passing that it was a community research programme which enabled a team in edinburgh to identify a probable link between the creutzfeldtjakob syndrome and mad cow disease .
mr linkohr 's excellent report highlights two points to which i should like to return . the first is the recommendation that these programmes should be managed more efficiently .
i know that this is a matter of concern to a great many of you . it is also a concern that i share .
it has been referred to in this debate , notably by mrs quisthoudt-rowohl . despite the progress achieved in the course of the last few years , further improvements in this area can and must be made .
as a step in that direction , a seminar involving senior commission officials and representatives of the scientific community and of industry is to be held shortly .
as promised , i shall now communicate to you the position adopted by the commission on the various amendments to its proposal .
i should like to reply at this point to mr tannert , who spoke on the subject of nuclear energy .
the commission also deems it preferable not to make any pronouncements on amendments proposed in plenary which seek to alter its proposals beyond the bounds of mere clarifications and on which cert has not had the opportunity to comment .
it does , however , note with interest the priority attached to intermodality by a number of speakers , especially mr ferber , mrs quisthoudt-rowohl and mr desama in their compromise amendments .
while standing very firm on the principle of 700 million in supplementary financing , the commission basically has an open ear for the ideas underlying several of the proposed amendments .
it is likewise open to politically important themes , such as the detection of land mines , and to the idea of spreading the supplementary financing over three years .
at this stage in the proceedings , however , the commission prefers not to incorporate the amendments in question .
it must be remembered that the supplementary financing has to be adopted by codecision , which means that the unanimous approval of the council is required .
any formal modification of key points in the commission proposal would be liable to make the achievement of an overall compromise between the institutions even more difficult .
such a compromise must be our objective . in general terms and on numerous specific points , the positions of parliament and the commission are very close , as indeed is often the case .
in their joint decision to adopt the fourth framework programme , parliament and the council undertook to formulate their positions on supplementary financing by the end of june 1996 .
it would be a pity if this undertaking were not honoured .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
energy efficiency of domestic electrical appliances
mr president , members will be aware that we have already been through the general aspects of this report in the first reading .
the commission proposals did this by looking at the question of improving the efficiency of refrigerators .
so when we went through the first reading we made some substantial statements and some substantial progress .
we come to the second reading now , having had our common position outlined by the council .
just to remind members , the first set of norms proposed by the commission was for a 10 % improvement in energy efficiency , whereas we are convinced that a 20 % target is required .
it was proposed in the first reading that there should be a flexible implementation system which was based on information given to consumers , which was an innovative approach .
some of these proposals met with the approval of the council and some did not .
the first point is that the council agreed on a 15 % energy efficiency target , which was similar to the commission 's revised proposal .
it decided that the implementation time for the first norms would be three years after adoption , whereas the commission and parliament had proposed two years .
the council text refers to a possible second set of norms but , frankly , it is so vague as to be almost evasive .
unless there is a specific figure mentioned , then there is no point in talking about improvements or , for that matter , like one of the amendments which i do not support , ' substantial improvements ' .
that is not worth the paper on which it is written .
so we have a crunch here about setting firm targets .
at the same time , the committee has wisely compromised on two issues .
one is to say to the industry which is asking for a voluntary agreement or the possibility of a voluntary agreement : okay .
you have got some time after the introduction of the first set of norms to come up with a voluntary agreement .
we will wipe the slate clean and forget about the fact that nothing happened for four or five years when you wanted one before and we will take you at your word now .
but , if this agreement is not achieved , the commission has to propose a firm piece of legislation , and we would support this .
the other compromise we have made is on this rather controversial and , some would say , bizarre category of subtropical and tropical appliances .
the expert advice was that really the whole category did not make a lot of sense .
so there is a small exception , which allows us to meet the council half way .
i plead with parliament to get the amendments proposed by the committee through in toto , otherwise we will have been wasting our time .
it is also stated that refrigeration appliances consume a great deal of electricity , and that this is an area in which the eu can do something .
the proposal seeks to remove the heaviest energy users from the market , but unfortunately the effect will be no more than that of natural innovation in the sector .
the technology is available , and the sector should make use of it .
the most important thing in the proposal is that the commission commits itself to bringing forward a proposal for a second set of norms to match what modern technology can do .
with the first set of norms , we are merely getting rid of the heaviest energy users .
the commission says that it will be of benefit for consumers , society and the environment to have refrigeration appliances which are more energy-efficient , and that this is technically feasible .
while we are waiting for the co2 tax , we can make appropriate use of the mechanisms of the internal market .
this week , we have put the union 's future climate strategy on the agenda .
in this context , it will be remarkable if we cannot agree on this proposal , which in spite of everything is a step along the road .
as commissioner papoutsis rightly pointed out , the end is one thing and the means another .
for example , the council recently cut back the save programme from ecu 150 million to ecu 45 m .
this raises serious doubts as to whether there is any political will at all in the council to tackle the co2 problem .
the iea has produced comparative studies of worldwide refrigerator norms .
in the usa , for instance , a third set of norms is being introduced in 1998 which is much more ambitious than the council 's proposals , and that is in the free and liberal united states .
europe is far behind .
mr president , i should like , very briefly , to indicate the position the socialist group will take on mr macartney 's amendments .
in general terms , the socialist group intends to support mr macartney 's five amendments .
i could leave it at that , but honesty compels me to admit to mr macartney that the recommendation will not be supported by the entire socialist group .
we should have welcomed a greater degree of willingness to achieve some sort of rapprochement between the positions of the various institutions .
be that as it may , notwithstanding this reservation - which does not concern the substance of mr macartney 's proposals - the recommendation will have the support of the socialist group , but not its unanimous support .
mr president , the objective of reducing the greenhouse effect is absolutely praiseworthy given that there is a great deal of macroscopic evidence that the planet is heating up .
a person travelling by scooter saves energy as compared with someone using a mercedes but has a less efficient vehicle .
when considered in detail , the directive at issue does not appear to constitute a balanced measure , given that there has been no socio-economic study on the costs for consumers in the north and in the south .
the intention is not so much to make it difficult to take that step as to allow the commission to structure it better and resume the study .
that has in fact been the commission position in the committee on research , technological development and energy , and the council position similarly .
i therefore commend to the house amendment no 5 .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , domestic fridges and freezers account for 7 % of the total electricity consumption in the european union .
a 15 % reduction in energy consumption could mean as much as a 1 % drop in electricity consumption and lower co2 emissions throughout the union .
there is also no evidence that energy efficiency will drive the price of fridges up .
on the contrary , there are already more energy-saving coolers which are no more expensive to buy than the average fridge .
so the cost will not be higher for the consumer or , in all likelihood , the producer .
the liberal group supports the rapporteur 's proposal to introduce a second series of measures once the first phase has been evaluated .
these amendments are not about energy savings or environmental protection .
they are about something else : a disguised and covert trade war .
one cannot fail to take account of the different conditions prevailing in the various member states .
one cannot say that there is a single study on this subject , when in fact there are several which justify the need to distinguish between different refrigerators .
in fact , mr macartney 's amendment no 3 , concerning four-star refrigerators , is technically quite incorrect .
today , refrigerators do not a have a single compartment .
the four-star compartment is a freezer , but refrigerators have other compartments which require fewer stars . and these compartments are not given co-efficients , although they would meet the directive 's requirements if they were .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to begin by thanking mr macartney for his report and for his work during parliament 's second reading of the proposal .
as he has pointed out very clearly , the great importance of this proposal lies in the fact that it forms part of the european union 's strategy for the stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions .
it will not , in absolute terms , make the biggest contribution to the reduction of those emissions , but it is a necessary element in the pursuit of the objective .
if we are really serious about that objective , we must do everything that is economically feasible to achieve it .
and this measure offers a favourable cost-benefit for society as a whole .
the proposal will also produce substantial savings for our peoples .
i feel obliged to say that parliament , through the committee on energy , has done much to improve the text and to give the directive a good balance over the course of the second reading .
you will have noted that the commission , with this modified proposal , has heeded parliament 's call at the first reading for a strengthening of the original proposal .
the common position is now very much stronger than it was in the first proposal .
we believe that the common position now strikes the right balance between protection of the environment and the protection of consumers and the interests of the manufacturers , and we can therefore support it .
as regards the amendments , amendment no 1 is very important because it has to do with the adoption of the second phase .
the commission has always supported the need for a dynamic approach and for the implementation of a second phase of measures five years after the adoption of the directive .
the commission welcomes the fact that parliament has taken a positive stance on the question of the voluntary agreements to be implemented in the second phase .
that , too , conforms with the common position .
however , according to the recommendation of our experts in their extensive study , a precise determination of the technical and economic improvement in the level of efficiency is not possible at this present time .
the commission thinks it important that the economic and technical factors should be evaluated when the first level enters into force and that determination of the second level of efficiency improvements should be embarked on afterwards .
in view of that , the commission , while accepting the principle expressed in amendment no 1 , cannot accept the proposed text where the improvement of efficiency is given a quantification .
we do not have the necessary figures , and it is far too early to contemplate such an amendment .
i believe that what we all want , in the policy sense , is to see the adoption procedure for this proposal brought to a satisfactory conclusion .
amendment no 2 , concerning the period of adjustment for the first phase , is acceptable to the commission .
and we are glad that the three legislative institutions agree on the 15 % figure for efficiency improvement in the first phase , because it obviously strengthens the original proposal .
amendment no 3 deals with an exceedingly technical aspect which has already been discussed in detail in the committee on energy , and i would not wish to go into all the details of it today during this debate .
however , as the experts have said , at least for four-star refrigerator-freezers , these coefficients are technically justified .
i therefore welcome parliament 's acceptance of them , and i can say that the commission can accept this amendment .
amendment no 4 , on the new version of the en 153 standard of july 1995 can also be accepted by the commission .
amendment no 5 , tabled by mr malerba to amendment no 8 concerning the adoption of the second phase , approximates very closely to the common position .
the only difference is that ' improving ' is changed to ' significantly improving ' .
this change would be acceptable to the council and would obviate the need for the conciliation procedure .
for that reason the commission supports the amendment .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , in concluding i would like to request parliament to support amendments which will permit swift adoption of this proposal .
if we truly wish to contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000 , it is the most significant thing that we can do .
we need to move rapidly .
i wish to thank all of you , and the rapporteur , mr macartney , in particular , for your substantial contribution to the improvement of this proposal and for giving it your support .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
short sea shipping
mr president , together with my colleagues , i very much welcome the initiative taken by the commission in this area .
the committee on transport has worked on a good many maritime questions in recent years , particularly involving safety .
now we have come to the development of shipping in the future .
this report may only deal with a communication , but it is a pleasure to be able to present an end result which supplements this initiative .
we have also noted in the committee that the council has a positive attitude towards the maritime sector .
unfortunately , this is not always borne out in practice .
as pushkin put it , words are one thing , actions quite another .
we are therefore some way from the goal we write and speak about so much : short sea shipping as part of the european transport network .
and we all know how things are going with the conciliation procedure .
at this very moment , they will be sitting down and arguing in luxembourg .
unfortunately , that is why the chamber is half empty , because those of my colleagues who are waging the campaign for the maastricht treaty to be applied in this area as well are not present .
but the wish to create a coherent transport system in europe may be harder to put into effect than a common european security and defence policy .
enough of that , however ; let us now turn to the report .
the first is the ports structure and related matters .
the second is competition between the different modes of transport .
these two areas are mentioned in all the statements and all the answers from hearings in this context , and in connection with the production of this report .
it is very important for the commission and the council to be aware of this .
on the first point , when will a common position be established as regards the ports sector which all the member states will apply ?
and on the second , will we succeed in making the initiative on fair pricing and so on something which the council of ministers takes seriously ?
will any more concrete initiatives and decisions be forthcoming ?
turning to the amendments , i am grateful for the contributions from the committee on regional policy , the committee on economic and monetary affairs , the economic and social committee and the committee of the regions .
we have reached out to each and every part of europe , to every port and every ship , in order to discuss this subject .
there are two specific amendments to be dealt with , the first by mrs myller and others .
on a previous occasion , i found it helpful to ask the commission to assess the growing volume of low-standard river-going ships operating in europe which come from the former east european countries .
the amendment by mrs myller and others can therefore be accepted .
i have discussed the other amendment , by mr wijsenbeek , with the author and i am bound to say that it belongs in a different area of the debate .
i should therefore like to thank the secretariat and the commission , and i hope that the council of ministers , which will be planning the development of european transport , will be able to achieve a good result .
let me emphasize from a personal point of view , partly with my own father and grandfather in mind , that shipping was once the future .
for many years now , it has been underrated .
i believe that if we adopt a sensible approach , it will be the role of parliament , the commission and the council to bring shipping to the forefront once again .
if we are serious about this , then decisions are the order of the day .
politics is all about will , about having the will to do things .
it is not about waiting to see how the market develops .
we should not think that there will be any changes in european transport policy if we fail to decide anything at european level .
i thank him for the effort that he has put into this report which has ensured that all parties concerned with the future of the maritime sector have fully participated in the development of our response .
the role of short sea shipping clearly needs to be developed .
as many of us are already aware , it already plays a key role in the transportation of goods throughout the european union ; indeed 30 % or 40 % of our trade is already by short sea shipping .
clearly that role needs to be developed , not just for historical or sentimental reasons .
i should like to deal briefly with both of those issues in turn .
firstly the economic objectives : the development of ports and port infrastructure and short sea shipping would actually work well towards fulfilling our objective of assisting ireland and the peripheral areas .
many of the run-down areas in the european union with high levels of unemployment are often associated with these ports and coastal areas .
we would therefore be facilitating the regeneration of declining peripheral areas if we supported the measures outlined by the rapporteur .
secondly , overall within the european union we will enhance industrial competitiveness if we make short sea shipping in europe more competitive .
my second area of interest is the environment .
we must not overlook the fact that the short sea shipping sector could play a key role in fulfilling our environmental objectives .
we therefore desperately need to ensure that short sea shipping is promoted to enable the eu to fulfil its international obligations .
mr president , on behalf of the group of the european people 's party , i wish to congratulate mr sindal on his excellent report on the commission 's communication on the development of short sea shipping in europe .
with just a few amendments , the commission 's guidelines and action programme will be extremely effective .
a reasonable level of mobility in the long term depends on more flexible and efficient transport infrastructures and rational connections between them .
from this point of view above all , but also for environmental and regional policy reasons , i warmly welcome all those aspects which help to shift goods traffic from the roads to coastal waters .
short sea shipping must therefore become simpler , cheaper and more efficient in terms of transport times .
for these reasons alone , and not on grounds of content , our group is proposing to reject the majority of these amendments .
a new element raised in amendment no 3 is the effect of the development of short sea shipping on the creation and preservation of jobs in eu shipyards .
we should therefore support this amendment .
mr president , there are three factors in favour of short sea shipping . overland traffic in central europe is increasing at a rate of 5 % a year , which leads to an increase in congestion .
short sea shipping makes sense and is a suitable form of transport for the most remote european areas , such as the baltic sea , the mediterranean and the black sea .
increased accessibility for eu vessels to russia 's inland waterways is also a way of developing financial ties between the european union and russia .
in particular this would create significant opportunities for developing the saimaa waterway network in eastern finland .
finally i would like to congratulate my colleague mr sindal on a very well prepared report .
mr president , i should like to thank mr sindal for his work in highlighting this neglected sector .
we are always worried about job creation and here is an area where we could really stimulate enormous job potential .
at present there are 600 ports near industrial centres .
there are hundreds more that could potentially be developed for this purpose .
previous speakers have mentioned the aid to stop congestion on the roads which is horrendous and costly in every way , and also that this is an environmentally friendly kind of procedure .
european funds would be well spent if we could encourage further action of this kind and it has to be encouraged because the political will seems to be lacking on the part of our governments .
there are 90 islands in my constituency and many have ferry connections .
but we no longer have direct links , as we used to have in scotland , with the low countries , scandinavia and the hanseatic ports .
we could so easily have those links and it would help everybody .
if ever we were looking for ways to assist job creation , this would be an area that we should be considering .
secondly , the time spent by vessels in port must be reduced .
a good deal of progress has already been made here through the use of modern loading and unloading techniques , but it would still be useful to investigate ways of reducing the time still further .
short sea shipping is also very much held back by cumbersome customs procedures , particularly veterinary checks , and by the monopolies enjoyed by the providers of services in some ports .
this problem receives little attention in the commission document , despite the fact that it is one of the commission 's responsibilities to promote the smooth operation of the internal market .
finally , we must not forget that the promotion of short sea shipping must be seen as part of our overall transport policy .
there is competition not just between the various shipping operators , but also between shipping and other modes of transport , particularly rail .
mr president , there is no doubt that the rapid increase in the volume of traffic that we are seeing as trade expands within the single market means that we have to find new methods of looking at transport .
the recommendation drawn up by the commission in its white paper on transport policy is therefore an obvious and natural consequence of developments in the sector .
it is vital for that purpose that we move from land transport to other forms of transport , such as short sea shipping and river transport .
that is why those working in this area should pay greater attention to sea transport , and specific infrastructures need therefore to be created to reduce costs and remove obstacles .
the ports should , in particular , make an essential contribution with customs checks , on persons and goods , and also animal health checks .
moreover , relaunching short-haul sea transport could provide a fresh incentive for economic activity in certain regions , creating new jobs .
mr president , sea shipping relieves and lightens overland traffic in many ways .
this is also the case in the area around the baltic sea , as mr sindal points out in his excellent report .
transportation across the baltic sea involve the use of several different transport vehicles ; the cargo has to be unloaded and reloaded due to the water levels and the archipelago .
it should be possible to link cargos more smoothly to other parts of the transport chain .
a good example of this is the rail-ship combination , which is expected to increase strongly due to demand .
in the baltic countries , any future member states of the european union , the legislation , the development of ports and of traffic structure require a good deal of work .
it would also be sensible for the european union to invest in the development of port infrastructure in this area .
transport connections to northern europe which work well are obviously beneficial to trade in the entire eu .
the baltic area should consequently be given similar status in eu traffic policy as has already occurred in the mediterranean area .
finally i would like to stress an environmental issue about which i feel that the european union should make an initiative and start preparatory actions .
i am referring to the transport of oil in european waters - oil transportation , both in small and large vessels , should be prohibited unless the vessels are equipped with a double hull .
the catastrophe in wales showed that double hulls are an absolute necessity in both small and large oil-transporting vessels , and consequently all vessels in question should be equipped in this way .
minimum safety levels really must be imposed in order to protect human life and to ensure respect for the environment .
a list of essential conditions could be drawn up , and special attention must be given to the need for a minimum training standard for crews .
moreover , standards governing the construction and refurbishment of ships ought to be adopted , since the short sea shipping fleet comprises many small and dilapidated craft .
that could serve as an opportunity to promote european dockyards , thereby establishing a european preference in the domain of ship repairs .
mr president , it is vitally important , not least for environmental reasons , to do everything we can to move goods and passenger traffic off the roads and onto the railways and the various waterways .
from the perspective of a landlocked european country , inland waterways should be given rather more prominence in this overall context .
given the likelihood that east-west transit traffic on austrian roads will increase sharply as a consequence of enlargement to the east , shipping on the river danube will represent an important alternative .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mr kinnock has asked me to apologize to you for not being able to be here today .
he is attending a meeting of the transport council in luxembourg .
first of all i would like to thank mr sindal and the committee on transport for this very positive and constructive opinion .
i note as well that the opinion gives support to the policy of the commission regarding the measures proposed in the communication on the development of short sea shipping .
i understand the anxiety about the need for more emphasis to be given to the social dimension of maritime transport .
in due course you , as the parliament , will undoubtedly turn your attention to the specific measures proposed in the communication , and i feel sure that you will view them as positive .
in the framework of that communication , the commission has embarked on a study of the vocational training and employment of seafarers in the member states .
the study will cover the following areas :
obviously , we will make the recommendations of the study known to parliament and the other institutions .
the five-year experimental programme will be completed in december of this year .
the commission intends to use the new pact programme to make the combined transport pilot projects concerned with short sea shipping eligible for financial support on an equal basis with those relating to other forms of transport .
in the future development of policy in the short sea shipping sector the commission will take account of parliament 's recommendations and will keep it informed about progress that is made .
this process has already begun , and the seventh plenary of the forum in marseilles on 4 and 5 july will make a first formal assessment of the progress that has been made so far .
to conclude , i would like to thank mr sindal again for his splendid report and the european parliament for its painstaking perusal of the communication .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
climate change
the next item is the statement by the commission on the current and future strategy on climate change .
so i shall concentrate on what is taking place now .
the second conference will be held in geneva from 8 to 18 july . it is part of the process of leading the parties to the convention to enter into further commitments .
for the industrialized countries , this mandate therefore goes much further than the commitment under the convention itself , which principally sets the target of stabilizing the emissions of greenhouse gases at 1990 levels in the year 2000 .
it is anticipated that these agreements will take the form of a protocol to the framework convention .
for the first time in the international negotiations on climate change , the industrialized countries will be focusing their efforts on specific targets for reductions in the coming decades , and on specific political measures to achieve them .
and the negotiations will of course therefore be difficult .
under the timetable laid down in the berlin mandate , agreement is to be reached on these issues at the second and third conferences of the parties , the latter to take place at the end of 1997 .
the negotiations on the berlin mandate have scarcely begun , however .
all the parties are now in the process of establishing what commitments they think they can enter into .
the second conference of the parties should thus be regarded as an intermediate step with the aim of giving further political direction to this process .
it is extremely important that the european union should maintain its leading role in these negotiations .
the targets that we set , the political strategies for achieving them and the measures to reduce emissions must be both ambitious and credible .
at the second conference , this eu initiative will be pursued in other sectors , and here i would mention forestry , agriculture and industry .
against this background , the commission will continue to be a driving force in the process .
i have therefore decided to seek a mandate from the council , following the second conference of the parties , to negotiate on the basis of article 228 of the treaty .
an ambitious and consistent policy on climate change has a very high priority in the european union .
to implement such a policy , we need to be active and credible both domestically and internationally .
the measures we take must be framed in such a way that they show our wish to achieve results and increase our credibility .
we in the commission are firmly convinced of the need for an eu-wide tax instrument to support the efforts to reduce co2 emissions .
the commission therefore does not intend to withdraw the current proposal .
mr president , it is now four years since the commission published its original proposal for the introduction of a community-wide co2 energy tax .
at the time it was seen as an essential part of the community 's efforts to meet international targets which , after all , they had agreed at rio .
in spite of that agreement , four years on the proposal still stands blocked by the very council whose members agreed these original targets .
drought , storm damage , floods would become more likely and medium and long-term insurance costs are therefore likely to become considerable burdens on industry and consequently on job creation .
the council seems to have forgotten that sustainable jobs depend on a sustainable environment .
short-term thinking in both industry and governments has meant that council is still unwilling to take any action .
the latest ridiculous example of this was the slashing of the save ii programme .
have these people never heard of the precautionary principle ?
do they not take advice from their own scientists ?
do they not realise that they are prejudicing the well-being and even the livelihood of european citizens ?
the lessons from last week 's rome conference in which the commissioner , the italian president-in-office and myself took part are there to be learned .
in spite of increased unemployment , the fact is that taxation on labour has more than doubled in the last thirty years but taxation on resource-use has remained steady at only 10 % .
it is time we embraced the economic model advanced in chapter 10 of the delors white paper and altered that balance .
as far as we are concerned , the commission must redouble its efforts to persuade member states that the creation of employment and the protection of the environment go hand in hand .
both demand a credible and active policy to reduce co2 emissions through a combination of incentive , regulation and progressive taxation .
that policy is needed sooner rather than later .
i hope , therefore , that when the conference of parties to the convention on climate change meets in july , they will not simply add to the greenhouse effect by generating even more hot air .
we have had quite enough of that .
mr president , i welcome the commissioner 's statement and , in particular , that she speaks on behalf of the commission in deploring the latest developments in the council over the co2 energy tax .
i agree with her emphasis on the political nature of this problem and welcome her call for us to take a leading role .
i share with her the belief that the relevant timescale is from now until the kyoto conference .
this is a global problem and it needs a global solution .
so i have brought her this evening a modest proposal which i invite her to support .
it would dramatise political attention if we were to indicate exactly why this is so politically difficult .
it is so politically difficult because of the fossil fuel industries ' determination to jam up the legislative process both here and in america .
so i invite her to support an idea of mine , which is that we should take to naming hurricanes after oil companies .
when hurricane exxon hits the florida coast this might well focus attention quite eloquently .
but since we are talking of ambition , i believe we must ask some questions about the types of initiative that the commission and the european union might take in the coming weeks in connection with the geneva conference .
it is a proposal that my political friends and i find too weak , but it points in the right direction .
we believe it is totally realistic to set a 20 % reduction in the 1990 figure as a target for 2005 , a 30 % reduction for 2010 and 50 % for 2030 .
it is perfectly realistic from a technical point of view as well as being economically advantageous .
all the arguments prove that , which is why i think we ought to move in this direction .
is the commissioner able to confirm or deny the existence of this paper , and what does she think of its alleged content ?
i believe that is quite crucial to the future course of our debate .
but whenever we discuss transport in particular , we notice that the environmental aspect is excluded .
the maastricht treaty may well be criticized , but to its credit it does lay down convergence criteria and quantifies them .
we have no such criteria for the environment or for combating the greenhouse effect .
why , commissioner , should we not establish environmental convergence criteria which the member states and the commission and governments would be bound to follow and which would be quantified in accordance with environmental needs ?
once again , the vacuum left by the lack of political will has been filled , as mr spencer rightly said , by business , liberalism and the quest for profit .
shall we have to leave the government of europe to the tender mercies of those multinationals which , at the moment , are doing their business at the expense of consumers ?
i think not .
finally , the latest un conference , habitat ii on cities , illustrates to us how urgently the commission needs to let its voice be heard by the council of ministers and , ultimately , to reassert its authority .
we do not appear to know yet what the precise link is , and i would therefore ask the commission to intensify its research programme in this field .
it seems to me that we need more information on this link in order to be able to develop an appropriate reduction strategy .
what does the commission think about this ?
what approach does it intend to adopt at the forthcoming conference on climate change and the developing countries ?
what efforts are we making in europe , and which projects by the developing countries are we prepared to support financially ?
does the commissioner agree that if the union is to maintain its credibility , we must ensure that the support we provide is balanced between europe and the developing world ?
and what was the reason for our failure ?
according to the commissioner , it was because the ecofin council will not accept our co2 tax .
the next question is : what exactly should it do ?
will we have to change from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy , and reduce energy consumption ?
what has the commission agreed to do about this , or is the co2 tax still the only thing anyone talks about ?
what precise agreements have been reached ?
the best idea , it seems to me , would be to see what we can arrange on a voluntary basis with our industries , in the form of self-regulation .
i would therefore urge the commissioner to come up with a plan that we can consider in parallel with the co2 tax , so that we can go along to the international conference with some honest proposals .
mr president , my question relates to what the previous speaker and the other dutch members have said .
what we are talking about this evening obviously concerns the developing countries , and the netherlands has already felt the effects , as it were , of climate changes in the antilles .
i have a very specific question which relates to those raised by my colleagues .
the islands of the pacific and the caribbean will be in the front line if the situation deteriorates .
an ambassador in the pacific once said ' we are the canaries of the mines ' .
mr president , the reports we have debated here this evening have had a great deal to say about climate change .
they dealt with precisely the problem taken up by commissioner bjerregaard .
i believe that the debate has demonstrated parliament 's concern for this issue extremely well ; there was not a single speaker who did not stress the importance of taking measures in this field .
i might perhaps be able to advise them to study carefully the carbon taxes which have been introduced in sweden .
i willingly admit that we have had failures in some areas but in others these taxes have been very successful .
there is every reason to promote this in other countries in the union .
mr president , i am grateful for the many helpful comments on a problem which i recognize is one that we agree should be taken seriously .
there are a few points which i should like to make about some of what has been said .
i very much agree with mr collins that when you run into difficulties , there is little else to do but try to redouble your efforts , and i think we are in fact trying to do so .
several members referred to the save ii programme . mrs dybkj&aelig;r did so , and mr blokland called for more resources to be provided for targeted research programmes .
mr lannoye referred specifically to the german proposal and the objective which it contained .
this is a general objective on which we have an opportunity of moving forward .
i can tell mrs van putten that measures are well under way to help the smaller islands , and to help with the problems to which she referred .
i will gladly look at the scope for doing more , together with commissioner pinheiro .
we are very conscious of the matter , and there is excellent cooperation in this area .
mr president , i gather that the commissioner says she did not understand my question .
let me explain .
my question is : what progress has europe really made in reducing co2 ?
and the answer is none at all .
why can you not try something like this ?
why not try and move forward with new projects instead of just sitting back and waiting ?
the second question referred to whether or not a proposal was about to be put forward by the commission limiting the acceptable future concentration of co2 in the atmosphere to a ceiling of 550 parts per million .
that would lead , it must be said , to an average temperature increase of two degrees .
does this proposal exist , or does it not ?
is it a basis for discussion ?
that is not true .
in addition , we have been calling very strongly for targets to be established , and we have been active in this respect following the berlin conference .
this has been achieved for some countries in various ways , and we have explained some of the ways in which it has been done .
the debate is closed .
( the sitting was closed at 7.40 p.m. )
approval of the minutes
the minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
mr president , concerning item no 10 on page 16 of the minutes , mr novo raised the matter of the use of the bridge over rue belliard to film a demonstration .
the president said that he would reply in writing .
it was a legitimate question and we are all entitled to hear the answer .
if parliament 's premises are to be used by the goons and the ginks and the finks we are all entitled to know .
perhaps the minutes do not record the president 's words accurately , mr smith .
he asked mr novo to submit his observations to him in writing .
( parliament approved the minutes )
calendar of part-sessions
at its meeting of 13 june , the conference of presidents decided to propose the following calendar of part-sessions for 1997 :
the vote will take place at 12 noon on wednesday , 17 july .
mr president , am i correct in thinking you said that the deadline for tabling amendments would be wednesday 3 july ?
that would be preposterous .
it would be before we have a proper discussion in the main group meetings .
you have to allow the full group meeting in the week before the plenary session so that groups can make decisions as to how they will vote .
this is not the prerogative of four or five people sitting in a smoke-filled , or any other , room .
the groups have to meet .
thank you , mr tomlinson . the president set this deadline precisely so that the political groups would be able to discuss the calendar beforehand .
in any event , i shall pass on your comments to the president .
there is another meeting of the conference of presidents this thursday , and the group chairmen will thus have an opportunity to discuss the deadline and change it if necessary .
decision on urgency
mr santini has the floor to give the opinion of the committee on agriculture as the committee responsible .
( parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure )
mr president , i would formally request the house to agree to urgent procedure .
we have fallen badly behind with our emergency aid for bosnia-herzegovina .
i was there with other members a fortnight ago , and we were able to see that the emergency aid of ecu 92 million cannot be put into effect because of the lack of a legal basis .
please do not make the people in bosnia-herzegovina , who desperately need this money , pay the price of the disagreement over the legal basis .
if we do not agree to urgent procedure , it will take longer still for this money even to reach the start of the administrative process .
i would implore you to vote in favour of urgent procedure in this case .
mr president , we shall be looking at the question of finance tomorrow afternoon , and i hope that we can take the vote on thursday , because the committee on budgets adopted that report unanimously yesterday evening .
so i do not see how urgency will make any difference as far as the report on the regulation is concerned .
we would prefer to keep to the planned timetable , in other words to have the vote on the committee on budgets ' report on thursday and the debate on the report on the regulation in due course .
mr president , with reference to the alarming situation in bosnia , agreement was reached in january of this year at a tripartite meeting of parliament , the council and the commission on guidelines for the budget concerned .
most of the appropriations are to be used for the procurement of goods for the reconstruction of bosnia-herzegovina .
in other words , thanks to parliament 's decision in january to approve disbursement , eu aid is already a reality in the region and continues to flow in .
the legal formalities surrounding this aid do not therefore need to be dealt with as a matter of urgency .
secondly , mr president , the commission and the council have taken six months before deciding they wanted to seek parliament 's views on these legal issues .
if parliament now takes one month it can hardly be regarded as unreasonably dilatory .
thirdly , however , mr president , we in the european parliament have objections to the procedure proposed by the council .
the council decided on the regulation at its meeting of 10 june 1996 in luxembourg , when it also amended the commission 's proposal .
now parliament is being consulted on an issue on which the council has already adopted a standpoint .
i do not wish to rule out the possibility that parliament will request negotiations with the council once it has given its opinion in july .
in any event , mr president , we should today reject the proposal from the council for a special urgent debate on this subject .
thank you , mr cars .
we have heard one speaker in favour and one against , and mr cars has spoken on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs .
i now put the request for urgency to the vote .
( parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure )
emi annual report - currency fluctuations and the internal market - exchange rate relations- broad guidelines of economic policies
the next item is the joint debate on :
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i shall be very brief .
i do not intend to outline the report by the european monetary institute , but simply to comment on three rather important points which it raises .
first of all , there is the work done by the institute since the end of last year , which i am pleased to be able to tell you has gone according to schedule .
in other words , we are still on course to complete the structure for the future european central bank , and we have not encountered any serious delays .
there is therefore every reason to believe that the bank will indeed be able to get the single currency up and running in 1999 .
this was the first point i wished to make .
secondly , there is the analysis of the economic situation which we give in the report .
there have been no significant changes since the report was drawn up .
in my personal opinion it is extremely likely , and i expect to see a recovery in the second half of the year , though i cannot predict how strong it will be .
but whatever doubts there may be at the moment about its scale and strength , it is growing increasingly likely that it will happen .
thirdly , there is the process of convergence , which the report covers in some detail .
i am pleased to say that further progress has been made on convergence on inflation , interest rates and the stabilization of exchange rates , and we are certainly heading in the right direction .
i think that each and every country is fully aware of the scale of the problems confronting us , with or without maastricht .
we will have a clearer picture towards the end of the year , once we have seen the budget forecasts for next year .
these were the comments i wished to make to accompany our annual report .
there are still far too many question marks over the final outcome of this process , in which the european monetary institute plays a fundamental role .
nevertheless , the hoped-for economic recovery - which six months ago , the european commission was calling robust - has failed to materialize .
we believe that in its activities hitherto , the emi has been excessively reserved and restrained .
our committee also stresses the need for the adjustment of internal control mechanisms , with the introduction of new and effective procedures aimed at preventing the kind of distortions which occurred in connection with financial derivatives .
secondly , it should be remembered that as a result of these monetary fluctuations or upheavals , two currencies left the european monetary system in 1992 .
the ems was itself modified in 1993 , with the broadening of the fluctuation bands .
above all , however , the distorting effects on the internal market caused by the uncertainty and insecurity in the markets resulting from these fluctuations should be underlined .
since 1993 , the european monetary system has functioned satisfactorily .
despite the broadening of the fluctuation bands , the currencies which form part of the ems have been moving within reduced margins which correspond to the narrow bands in force before the summer of 1993 .
finally , i should like to make a few brief comments concerning the relationship between the ' ins ' and the ' outs ' - between the euro and the currencies which remain outside emu .
this issue is the subject of the report which will be introduced next , so i shall deal with it very quickly .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the third stage of economic and monetary union will begin with the establishment of the european central bank on 1 january 1999 .
however , it is probable that not all the member states will participate , because they are either unwilling or unable to do so .
this means in effect that monetary union will be achieved at various speeds , and we must ask ourselves the question : is this in fact compatible with the treaty of rome ?
for denmark and the united kingdom , the relevant protocols to the treaty make explicit reference to the socalled ' opting in ' and ' opting out ' .
it is fairly certain that one of these countries , and possibly both , will make use of this opportunity .
thus the treaty itself makes provision for a two-speed europe .
other countries will initially remain outside because they cannot yet meet the stability criteria .
i would remind the house on this point that the criteria were decided jointly by all the member states , and then ratified by all the national parliaments without exception .
we must abide by these criteria as stipulated in the treaty ; they must not be relaxed .
but nor should any further conditions be laid down before the entry into force of monetary union .
it would of course be preferable for all the member states of the european union to accede to the monetary union simultaneously , but that could only happen at the expense of stability .
the maastricht treaty sets out the priorities unequivocally : the stability of the common european currency is more important than its simultaneous introduction in all the member states .
but will not a variable-speed monetary union jeopardize the smooth functioning of the european single market , one of our major achievements ?
i would refer here to the exchange-rate turbulence experienced in recent years .
since 1993 , competitive devaluations have caused numerous jobs in the european union to be put at risk , and even lost .
what instruments do we have to prevent this ?
the prerequisite for exchange-rate stability is that all the eu member states should operate credible and sound financial , economic and monetary policies .
in addition , the existing exchange-rate system should be retained in a modified form .
however , when the new exchange-rate system comes to be designed , with the euro as its anchor currency , account must be taken of the experience gained with the ems .
the new system must demonstrate greater simplicity , transparency and flexibility than its predecessor .
flexibility is the key : the new exchange-rate system must be more flexible than the previous one .
any necessary exchange-rate adjustments between the euro and the other currencies must be geared to the realities of exchange relations , and they must be made in good time .
a major weakness of the ' old ' ems was that it was up to the member states involved to initiate the process for adjusting exchange rates .
time after time , this resulted in delays for political reasons , leading to adjustments being made under chaotic conditions ; such difficulties must be avoided with the new system .
we therefore support the proposal that the right of setting the adjustment mechanism in motion should be granted to the president of the european central bank .
what is more , the system must have fairly broad margins of fluctuation , to be set by mutual agreement .
member states wishing to do so could choose to have closer links with the euro , as they make progress towards meeting the stability criteria .
in my personal view , this new exchange-rate system will still function even if the united kingdom declines to participate .
the uk only participated for a short while in the present exchange-rate system : its lengthy absence brought no significant disadvantages , and nor did its brief participation lead to significant gains in efficiency for the system .
it should be borne in mind , however , that under the treaty , exchange-rate policy is a matter of common interest .
the uk is therefore obliged to keep the rate of the pound stable against the euro ; whether that happens within or outside the exchange-rate system is a secondary issue .
however , if the uk were to join the system , the exchange rate on entry would this time - unlike last time - have to be set by agreement with the other eu member states .
finally , i would just comment briefly on stability policy after the transition to monetary union .
global public sector debt in europe remains too high , and this works to the detriment of competitiveness and of the younger generation .
we are therefore awaiting clear proposals from the commission on how budgetary discipline can be maintained after the entry into force of monetary union .
clearly , however , the objective must be that ultimately all the member states of the european union will also be members of the monetary union .
1999 will be the decisive date for the central banks .
the decisive date for the citizens of europe will not come until the year 2002 , when banknotes and coins in the new currency are to be introduced .
mr president , it is not in any sense part of my job this morning to answer comments made by previous speakers .
but that is a matter which i am sure we will discuss endlessly in the coming months .
i speak this morning as the rapporteur on the annual economic report and part of the responsibilities that go with that rapporteurship is producing a report on the broad economic guidelines .
the compromise resolution , which we shall be voting on later today , is therefore unsatisfactory in some respects , but that is an inevitable part of having a compromise .
compromises , by definition , do not satisfy everyone and we would say that the joint resolution is all right up to a point but we shall be tabling a number of amendments to it .
one is to remove the commission from the line of fire of criticism , because you will have noticed that our resolution is somewhat critical of both the commission and the council .
but we believe that at this stage it is too late to criticize the commission .
this is something which the committee as a whole felt strongly about in the resolution on the annual economic report and it is a significant omission that it is not in the resolution to wind up this debate .
i hope that the house will agree to incorporate this point and that the house will also agree to the addition that the member states should create an environment where employers are encouraged to take on workers .
you will find in our resolution something to the effect that our president should take this resolution to florence .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i think we are moving towards an important decision .
the house is likely , by a large majority , to reject as unrealistic and inadequate the broad economic guidelines presented by the council .
that is very important , and it is also very important that we should do so by a large majority .
i agree with mr cassidy that we can no longer accept economic growth which is such that employment levels continue to decline .
i would , however , like to discuss with him in more detail what he means by encouraging employers to take on workers .
i believe that a very specific form of encouragement is required in the case of companies which are now able to earn far more from currency speculation than they can through genuine economic activity .
we need a change of direction here .
parliament has asked a number of questions which the commission has taken up in part , very tentatively , and which the council has not even acknowledged .
i would assume that a large majority of us will address ourselves to this task .
this is not because we think that the commission is the main culprit in this situation , so to speak - rather , the guilt lies chiefly with the council and the member states .
however , the commission too could do more , and we are therefore asking what initiatives it plans to take to bring about the necessary change in economic policy .
we are asking about the implementation of our priority of combating mass unemployment effectively , because we cannot expect the citizens of europe to tolerate another outpouring of meaningless fine words .
we are also asking in particular about additional commission measures to send a strong signal to the markets and help revive the economy .
we are asking for the much-trumpeted initiative of a european pact on employment to be presented at long last .
we are asking what efforts the commission plans to make to redress the balance between fiscal and employment policies in the multiannual programmes submitted by the member states .
the decision which we have to take today is not a trivial one .
the real issue is the point in time when the european community becomes relevant to every individual in this community .
i hope we shall decide by a large majority that this cannot go on .
i also hope that this will be the first impulse for real change .
unfortunately , the house does not yet have the power to force a change , but the governments would be well advised to react now , because otherwise the problems will seek out new governments .
the council expects the positive impact of the action taken by the member states in response to the maximum guidelines to become more perceptible as time goes on , with an improvement in economic conditions .
the council unanimously confirms the need to implement this policy combination , as these are policies which have the backing of the other community institutions , the commission and the european monetary institute .
consolidation of the process of adjustment , in its current form , is the way to create a macro-economic framework which increases growth and creates jobs .
increasing employment is the main priority , and the council is trying to identify those experiments which have been successful in the different member states in improving the employment strategies of those same states .
i can assure you that the convergence programmes are the focal point of the council 's multilateral monitoring procedure .
the aim of those programmes is to secure the convergence required for participation in the single currency area and they are important in themselves because they are designed to bring about sustainable and non-inflationary growth .
the treaty itself establishes a useful range of procedures - maximum economic guidelines , convergence programmes and procedures covering excessive deficits - in order to secure effective coordination .
this will be further improved as a result of the process which will bring into effect the third phase of european monetary union .
the maximum guidelines for economic policy , as well as the procedures relating to excessive deficits will , of course , become more rigorous in the context of monetary union .
as far as the objective of sound public finances is concerned , some limited progress has already been achieved in the last year .
if we are to increase growth and , therefore , levels of employment , there have to be measures designed to improve the operation of the markets , services and products .
the council , however , appreciates that national measures can be reinforced via the guidelines at community level .
if we are to do that , we need to attach less importance to the role of financial returns and concentrate resources on productive uses .
since our approach cannot be to restrict the social rights of workers in an effort to increase community competitiveness , we shall have rapidly to adopt measures designed to encourage innovation .
the commission 's green paper on innovation makes a very useful contribution to the debate on competitiveness and deserves to be looked at closely in terms of how it can be applied at both national and community level .
the council will be very interested to take part in and contribute to the forthcoming discussions designed to devise specific measures .
membership of the new system of exchange rate parities would continue , in the council 's view , to be optional ; however , provision can be made for those member states given an exemption to join the mechanism .
the council stated that it favoured an asymmetric system in which the euro acts as an anchor .
the new system would be designed in such a way as to permit various levels of convergence of the member states .
turning , finally , to budgetary discipline in the third phase , the council has asked all of the member states to aim in the medium term for a budgetary position that is close to equilibrium or in credit .
that should allow the automatic stabilizers to operate throughout the whole of the economic cycle .
the council , finally , has proposed strengthening the procedure concerning excessive government deficits under article 104c .
it takes the view that it will be necessary to set rigid time-limits , based on the assumption that the council will impose pre-set and proportionate penalties in cases where excessive deficit persist .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the commission is delighted that the house has decided to focus on economic and monetary union this week .
first of all , improvements to the macro-economic situation .
there is no alternative to the commission 's recommended policy of reducing public deficits in order to create jobs .
this year , the commission has two new recommendations : first , that the policy mix should be made more flexible over the long term .
we cannot hope for a substantial reduction in unemployment without strong , sustained medium-term growth supported by growth in investment .
the social effects of budgetary consolidation also need to be carefully balanced , and wage increases should be kept at suitable levels .
instead of increasing overall fiscal pressure , the commission recommends that increases in spending should be curbed and tax structures modified to reduce the tax burden on labour .
this will enable the policy mix to be relaxed still further , making it possible to create monetary conditions that are likely to keep interest rates down .
secondly , the structural measures taken to promote employment should be better coordinated .
the pact on employment gives the commission the tools it needs to implement the 1993 white paper on growth , competitiveness and employment and the conclusions of the essen european council in this field .
the pact is a collective initiative which spells out the various commitments undertaken by the public authorities and the social partners as part of an overall coordinated strategy .
as you can see , the commission is following its own recommendations in trying to make unemployment a matter of common interest .
but the broad economic policy guidelines are also a vital instrument in our progress towards economic and monetary union , and must be applied to the letter .
article 103 of the treaty states that member states must coordinate their economic policies as a matter of common concern , and this is why the commission recommends that updated national convergence programmes should be developed this year .
the programmes must make it clear how the convergence measures adopted pursue the general aim of strengthening growth and improving employment .
if economic policy is to be better coordinated at community level , the national programmes must represent a much firmer statement of political commitment , and the commission asks that they should be approved as such by the council .
the broad economic policy guidelines may be an effective and coherent method of achieving economic and monetary union , but transition to the third phase also depends on the achievement of monetary stability throughout the union .
the reports by mr p&eacute;rez royo and mr von wogau are an important contribution to the work the commission is doing on monetary stability and the need to avoid splitting europe in two when the euro is adopted .
the commission notes with satisfaction that your rapporteur confirms the analysis of the impact of currency fluctuations which it presented to the european council in madrid .
currency fluctuations are damaging to the single market , but at the same time we must not allow the market to be jeopardized by the introduction of protectionist measures .
the commission is determined to remain vigilant , and as you have requested , we will keep a close eye on the impact of currency fluctuations by regularly monitoring the economic indicators .
as your rapporteur himself recommends , the solution is to be found in closer convergence , particularly in the area of public deficits , and the introduction of the euro .
but we cannot have lasting monetary stability without convergence , and this is why there will be stronger convergence procedures running alongside the exchange-rate mechanism .
however , if it is to be entirely credible , the new system must also be flexible enough to accommodate the various levels of convergence between the different countries .
although anchored to the euro , it will still have to have fairly broad fluctuation margins , with compulsory intervention within these margins , as well as credit facilities .
it is for this purpose that the commission is currently examining ways of improving the present convergence programmes , which have proved that they are effective and will remain at the hub of the system .
in conclusion , i should like once again to underline the commission 's commitment to a coherent approach .
only by pursuing a healthy and stable macro-economic policy can we restore confidence and stimulate growth .
the broad guidelines were adopted unanimously by all the member states at the last ecofin council .
it is vital to maintain the overall dynamics of this policy by developing the necessary structural policies for promoting employment in europe .
economic and monetary union is a comprehensive project which will be concluded under the conditions and timetable set out in the treaty .
mr president , i should like to thank the council and the commission for their presentations this morning .
i shall concentrate on the broad economic guidelines .
the socialist group firmly rejects the guidelines adopted by the ecofin council recently and we are deeply unhappy with the approach taken by the commission regarding the economic prospects for the european union .
the first point is to look at the economic fundamentals which the commission claims are favourable .
we have historically high levels of unemployment .
some 50 million people in the european union are suffering social exclusion and poverty .
internal demand in the eu is depressed because of the attack on social protection and jobs .
real wages are stagnant .
business confidence fell again last month for the seventeenth month in a row and there is a collapse of consumer confidence .
public investment has fallen over the last ten years from 3.5 % of gdp to 2.5 % .
if the commission and the council claim these are favourable economic fundamentals i would like to see the statistics they are basing this on .
clearly europe is in crisis and we need coordinated measures by the commission and ecofin to try to bring europe out of that crisis .
the growth rate this year is 1.5 % , which i imagine will be estimated as even lower by the end of the year .
there may be a growth rate of 2 or 2.5 % next year .
it is completely insufficient .
that is why we have produced a very critical report on these guidelines .
in particular , i want to refer to the guidelines as approved by the council .
i hope the council is listening carefully to this .
there are ten cases where the council has deleted points from the commission 's guidelines , which parliament was already unhappy with .
why did the council delete the reference to a better economic policy mix more favourable to growth ?
the ecofin council deleted this . i want to know why .
the reference to the european parliament 's opinion on the economic annual report was deleted by ecofin .
why did it delete that ? a durable detente in macro-economic policy is essential to relaunch activity and strengthen growth in job creation in the medium term .
again , in the commission text , the council deleted that reference .
why did it do that ?
monetary policy can , within the spirit of article 105 of the treaty , contribute in a substantial manner to the achievement of community objectives as laid down in article 2 of the treaty .
that reference was deleted . why ?
the council has to explain to the house why it made these changes .
the commission text referred to the social partners and to the dialogue that exists .
the council deleted the reference to an efficient coordination between the different actors concerned and between countries as essential to ensure the coherence of these policies .
that reference was deleted and we want to know why .
it deleted the reference to the fact that measures aimed at improving convergence go hand in hand with the promotion of growth and employment in the medium term .
why did the council delete that from the broad economic guidelines ?
the ecofin council is acting with extreme arrogance if it believes it can simply disregard growth and employment in the european union .
we were deeply unhappy in this house with the commission text but at least it made some effort to refer to the need to bring unemployment down and to deal with the appalling levels of growth .
the council text is completely unacceptable to this house .
( applause from the left )
mr president , allow me first of all to thank mr lamfalussy and mr de silguy for their reports .
in connection with chapter 1 , however , on the growth of the economy , i have a number of observations that i think deserve discussion at greater length at some juncture .
for instance , the report does not stick as firmly as i think it should to the duration of financial performances , and the importance of that is something that i think needs to be stressed all the time .
the cause of smooth transition to economic and monetary union is certainly not helped if a country , after achieving satisfactory convergence figures , suddenly goes off the rails .
the institute 's report is , of course , pervaded by a certain optimism .
thinking back to my previous remarks , i have to say that it is logical for there to be some element of optimism in these analyses .
statements given out by the institutions of the european union cannot be pessimistic in tone or doom-ridden in their assessments .
naturally , there is a very big difference between that and projecting baseless assessments and analyses .
however , one can see that the financial prospects , as analyzed , are not far short of reality .
despite the element of optimism the substance is pretty accurate .
that applies for both the european monetary institute and the commission .
as regards the commission 's analysis and the changes in the financial prospects , i , too , have to say that i find them totally incomprehensible .
unless , that is , ecofin decided to adopt a purely technical approach and to refrain from policy projections and appraisals .
the emi report refers to the internal market as the instrument for growth , by contrast with 1994 when the talk was of export-led growth .
this difficulty , however , must be tackled in a logical and constructive manner and not by opting for things such as a slackening of monetary policy , which is the sort of thing that we often hear advocated .
at this present time there is no alternative to the strict monetary policy .
on the matter of unemployment , to attribute it to something entirely independent , to something which is not the consequence of other phenomena , is a massive error .
unemployment did not appear from nowhere .
it is the consequence of other phenomena , of structural phenomena to be precise .
we have to try to rectify these structural weaknesses , but it cannot be done via the countercyclical measures that are always being recommended here .
i say again : in these circumstances , countercyclical measures would in the long term bring a result exactly the opposite of that which is desired .
and why is this so ?
the reason is that is very important that we keep to the 1999 starting date and that progress is not impeded by certain very small percentages .
at some juncture more attention will have to be paid to this matter than at present .
mr president , let me begin by congratulating the three rapporteurs , in particular mr gas&ograve;liba , on the drafting of the reports we have been listening to .
as commissioner de silguy has pointed out , the emi framework defined in maastricht should be directed towards a more active role in coordinating the member states ' monetary policies .
there is finally a practical aspect on which we are focusing particular attention : this concerns the introduction on to the market of the new currency , the euro , and its distribution in the member states .
that will in fact be the point at which consumers discover the euro and with it perhaps a greater understanding of the community 's economic system .
public acceptance and understanding of the single currency will also imply acceptance and understanding of a united europe .
mr president , i am speaking on the broad economic guidelines .
the group of the european liberal , democratic and reformist party believes that there is a credibility gap at the heart of union economic policy , which is undermining public confidence in the entire enterprise .
there is a gap between aspirations and their realization , rhetoric and substance , and economic guidelines and their implementation .
the gap is measured most starkly by the 18 million people out of work and up to 50 million suffering from social exclusion and poverty .
it is a dismal record .
little wonder that in their day-to-day lives so many citizens are questioning europe 's ability to deliver the goods , because they know that action speaks louder than words .
the eldr group is strongly committed to achieving emu in line with the treaty criteria and timetable , but there remains space for real policy debate .
i have several questions to the council in the time permitted to me .
from the institutional point of view , i repeat the question : why has the council , even in the preamble to its recommendations , made no reference to parliament 's opinions ?
policy-wise , i wish to ask the council to respond today on the question of inflation policy , where we know that inflation is historically low and contained , according to our own analyses .
why is it that it recommends these results should be improved on ?
does the council not share the fear expressed recently by the bank for international settlements that there is a risk of deflation if we push the price stability objective beyond what is appropriate ?
what is the council 's view ?
if that is your way , it is a political mistake for the council and for europe .
( applause from the centre and the left )
mr president , the single currency scenario is paving the way for a multi-speed europe .
our group is extremely worried about the repercussions for the weakest countries , most of all , and for the millions of workers and unemployed people in the european union .
that will be followed by an even harsher anti-popular policy for the purpose of trying to meet the maastricht criteria , which will remain an unattainable dream .
the abolition of the ecu will generate new problems in connection with the community budget and fiscal relations between the european union and the countries which do not join the single currency .
the decision to pursue further enlargement of the european union adds another complication to the single currency process , and the costs of enlargement will be transferred down to the countries which remain outside the system .
mr president , the common denominator in this morning 's reports is that they all want to keep strictly to the schedule and criteria set for emu , regardless of the consequences .
it is clear however that by the end of the millennium we will not have a situation where all eu countries will be participating in a common currency .
in addition to this it is of course questionable whether emu will be implemented in the first place .
in any case emu will cause divisions in the union , and taking into consideration an expansion from the eastern bloc there will be at least a ' three-speed ' union .
as we know emu is a continuation of the internal market .
it is interesting and indicative that even mr mario monti , member of the commission , has now tabled a question concerning the fact that the internal market has not fulfilled the expectations on a macroeconomic level .
as far as employment especially is concerned the internal market has hardly had any positive effect .
the commissioner has also chosen to present this report during the summit in florence .
there has to be big question mark as to whether we are in for a similar disappointment as far as emu is concerned , since the internal market and emu are products of the same mind set .
the green group unanimously supports a healthy economic policy , where there is an equilibrium in the public sector and where budget resources do not have to be largely spent on interest payments on public loans .
at the moment however the european or nordic society is threatened , because we are aiming to implement these emu criteria far too quickly , perhaps even arrogantly .
for this reason the schedule simply has to be postponed .
another reason for a postponement of the emu schedule is that it makes a genuine rapprochement between the economies in the eu countries possible .
the economies of the european union member states have , according to some research , recently moved even further apart from each other .
perhaps we should agree on a factual precondition for emu , that employment really should be halved before emu is implemented .
this objective has been voiced by many member states with high unemployment and also by the european union .
a somewhat more flexible economic and monetary policy would have to be considered .
according to some estimates a one percent increase in inflation could help to create two million jobs .
above all the green group proposes a thorough reform of taxation .
the commission has recently published an interesting document on taxation within the european union .
the compromise resolution speaks out against this terrible gloom and doom of the 18 million unemployed and the 50 million on the bread-line .
there is such a colossal loss of dignity involved here that it is surely not to be tolerated .
all this demands action and yet the council and the commission do not seem to be listening to the european parliament which is the democratic base of all the institutions .
they must listen to us and we must see investment boosted , consumption boosted , lower interest rates , a rise in labour-intensive growth and an increase in consumer confidence .
today , when we see greater profitability , we do not necessarily see a reduction in unemployment or an increase in wages .
i have just read in the guardian today that british steel made &pound; 1 billion profit .
we have seen incredible profits made by british telecom recently .
this has not led to higher wages or a significant increase in employment .
we also all have to guard against the wishful thinking of some of the economic forecasting we have seen from the other bodies of the community .
economic forecasting has so often had to be revised downwards .
this creates yet more mistrust out there in the minds of our citizens ; it worsens confidence and has negative effects on consumers .
turning to emu , few member states seem to be able at this moment of forecasting to meet the criteria . i have noted them : luxembourg , ireland , denmark and the uk .
denmark and the uk have an opt-out , so in effect that is two .
i was privileged to be in the emac delegation to dublin recently where we had an excellent address from the irish finance minister .
he was pointing out that despite ireland 's strong growth they have not reduced unemployment .
so , you can meet the convergence criteria and still have the basic problem of unemployment .
ireland has that in a very serious way .
it must be looked at as an entity , almost separately from all these other matters .
i would like to support the compromise paragraph 6 and the emphasis on life-long learning , education , and the creation of new jobs in new sectors .
mr president , the report by mr von wogau is extremely useful .
the motion for a resolution rightly states , however , that monetary stability cannot be created by emu or an exchange-rate mechanism , but depends on the member states pursuing a credible economic and budgetary policy .
many member states , including france , germany and the netherlands , do not currently meet the entrance criteria , and there seems little likelihood that the position will change in the short term .
some politicians have panicked and called for the criteria to be relaxed , but all this does is to undermine the credibility of the euro and place a time-bomb under any new exchange-rate mechanism .
i really do wonder whether there is any point in forming a monetary union with only three or at most four member states , since the advantages would scarcely outweigh the costs of setting up emu .
an important practical reason why we should not establish a monetary union prematurely is that it would create a barrier to the early accession of countries from central and eastern europe .
it would be much better to align the economic and monetary policies of the present and future member states in a totally unforced way , with the member states themselves working to achieve monetary and exchange-rate stability .
this would improve the operation of the single market and avoid creating any unnecessary obstacles to the accession of central and eastern european countries .
degeneration into a two-speed europe is inevitable , and even if this state of affairs were to be only temporary , it is at odds with the goal of economic and social cohesion .
the distortions of competition , caused by unilateral devaluations , which are at present a burden on the external trade balances of certain member states , cannot be overcome by the countries with soft currencies remaining outside .
it is therefore particularly important to devise as soon as possible intervention mechanisms to neutralize speculative pressure .
this report , at any rate , contains only vague and general indications , and does not state when the general guidelines for the future exchange relations between participating countries and those not yet participating will be drawn up .
furthermore , in this divided europe , some parts of the export and tourism sectors in countries with hard currencies will continue to suffer significantly from the adverse effects of savings measures introduced in order to achieve convergence .
mr president , the reality that our economic guidelines have to deal with is that there are at least 18 million people officially out of work , with another nine million not covered by statistics .
they should be getting to grips with this problem , but they are patently failing to do so .
monetary stability creates confidence , but monetary stability cannot be achieved by creating social unrest .
this is a crucial time at which to be holding this debate , and it calls for more balanced guidelines than those before us at the moment .
first of all , instruments and indicators are going have to be adopted at the end of the year in dublin to give the essen agreements a more practical form and make them more binding .
second , the heads of government will shortly be meeting in florence to plot a course for a common , active european employment policy .
emu has already shown that coordination at european level which is binding on the member states can prove beneficial , and in florence this must be shown to be equally true for employment .
third , the european commission is currently making a desperate attempt to persuade the social partners to conclude agreements on a european employment policy in the form of a pact on employment .
finally , the negotiations at the igc are currently considering how to establish a balance in the treaty between monetary and structural employment policy .
but there is no sign of this happening . the balanced economic policy which parliament has called for on so many occasions involves recognizing the economic importance of the european social model .
the model is not just about expenditure : it is , first and foremost , a powerful means of promoting employment by maintaining purchasing power and demand , and thus creating stability .
the same applies to decent wages , which can also in turn encourage continuing training and education .
in short , restricting economic policy to a single market and a single currency is simply asking for the european union to remain economically weak and to continue to suffer mass unemployment .
for this reason , these economic guidelines should be at the very least amended or better still , in my opinion , rejected by the commission and the council .
although we are aware of the financial constraints which restrict what the governments can do , our group nevertheless regrets the changes which the council has made to the commission 's proposals .
that is why , unlike the socialist group , we do not want to tar the commission and the council with the same brush .
moving on to the von wogau report , i would point out that changes to exchange rates between the currencies of countries belonging to the same common market have always been a matter of common interest .
what this means is that the member states can no longer do as they please .
this makes sense , because changes to the exchange rates which are not simply designed to redress imbalances in purchasing power would distort competition and seriously damage the operation of the single market .
if the new european monetary system is sufficiently flexible , as the rapporteur has claimed , then the united kingdom should not have any serious objections to taking part .
it is therefore a mistake to give it the option , even now , of going its own way , which it tends to do all too often these days .
that is why , on this particular point , we do not agree with some of our colleagues and have tabled an amendment reaffirming the basic principles on which europe was founded .
one final comment on the ' ins ' and the ' outs ' , or the ' pre-ins ' and the ' ins ' , to use the current jargon .
the exchange-rate mechanism is essential if we are to prevent currency fluctuations in non-participating countries and to protect the single market .
the resolution rightly points out that while it relies mainly on the member states achieving convergence and sound financial management , it also needs to include ways of supporting any currencies under attack .
our group has some reservations , however , concerning paragraph 4 .
in order to prevent exchange-rate fluctuations in future , we agree with the resolution that we need greater convergence and closer monitoring of the macro-economic situation within the union .
the report also opposes any corrective measures which run counter to the rules of the single market , and it proposes specific measures to help small and medium-sized firms .
on the subject of combating currency fluctuations , i would point out that the french finance minister recently put forward three proposals to his union counterparts designed to prevent exchange-rate turbulence .
once we have entered the third phase of emu , the same question will arise in relation to the currencies of those countries which are still outside the system .
the council has already made progress in this direction by adopting , with the exception of the united kingdom and sweden , a proposed exchange-rate mechanism based on the ems .
the technical details are to be finalized at the dublin council , which is a concern raised in the motion for a resolution .
our group has serious doubts , however , as regards the proposal to introduce a tax on currency speculation .
how can you tell the difference between a speculative transaction and a cover operation ?
how effective would it be in a world where capital moves around freely and european currencies can be traded in financial centres in america , asia and elsewhere ?
in other words , why should we give the rest of the world an advantage over europe at a time when unemployment is still our biggest problem ?
it is subject to these reservations that our group supports all three of these reports .
i have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 40 ( 5 ) of the rules of procedure .
however , leaving aside the tremendous importance of emu , which my group hopes will create jobs , we must not forget the terrible problem of unemployment .
as many speakers have already mentioned , we have 18 million people out of work and many different forms of hidden unemployment .
it is a subject we have been talking about ever since i have been in the house .
an excellent report was produced on employment , growth and competitiveness which we have been discussing for two years now , but it has not yet been implemented .
mr president , despite all the considerable doubts and criticism the leaders of the union continue obstinately to insist on a dogmatic theory and its implementation - a theory which has no basis in reality .
what are the consequences which we can all see ?
what conclusion should be drawn ?
the conclusion is that it is time to give up an obsolete , dogmatic idea and choose a modern , flexible form of monetary cooperation and economic policy which is grounded in reality .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , how we have seen our language and ideas change since the maastricht treaty !
in 1992 , we were promised that all the member states of the union would adopt the single currency by 1 january 1999 at the latest , apart from a few minor derogations .
we maintained at the time that this was completely unrealistic , and we asked instead that the european monetary system should be reformed so that it would work properly .
however , while the current developments are certainly heading in the right direction , we are still not entirely happy with them , for two reasons .
first , the new ems cannot be more than a temporary arrangement , since the official objective , in theory at least , is still a single currency for everyone and convergence in the foreseeable future .
this policy seems as unreasonable as expecting all the member states to go for the single currency at the same time .
it suggests that it will be possible to apply a single economic policy across the board in the near future , which presupposes that our problems and therefore our societies will be as one .
in our view , this is ridiculous !
if disparate societies have this bureaucratic convergence forced upon them , it could have a very negative or even destabilizing effect on the system .
let us consider the theological problem first of all .
is the lord good ?
is the single currency good ?
france 's strawberry producers tend to think the single currency is good because of the devaluation of the spanish peseta .
but as it happens the spanish peseta and the italian lira , which are of interest to france 's cattle breeders , will probably not even join the single currency , so the apparent advantages are somewhat deceptive .
and even if the fifteen all join , the dollar will not , nor will the undervalued currencies of south-east asia , morocco and so on .
the single currency might suit the european single market , but the single market is becoming less and less european and more and more global , mainly because of the european commission 's free trade policies .
another much more serious problem is that a currency is nothing more than a vehicle for information on the economy .
it is the reflection or shadow of the economy , not the economy itself .
it is like the story of plato and the cave ; it is the signifier , not the signified .
but trying to force 15 different economies to have the same official monetary shadow is really just forcing them to chase their own shadows .
experience shows that if you chase your own shadow , you will eventually fall down exhausted and die .
and that equates , in economic terms , with unemployment , austerity , recession and protests , even in germany .
this brings us on to the teleological problem , or what it is all for .
the single currency may be fine , but what is it for , what purpose does it serve ?
is it europe 's objective to have a single currency , a single central bank and a single market , or is it prosperity , democracy and development ?
forgive me for saying so , mr lamfalussy , but when articles 107-109 say that the president of the european central bank shall not take instructions from anyone , it smacks more of oligarchy than democracy .
so even if there are some kind of parliamentary controls , they will not go very far .
and if the aim is prosperity , mr p&eacute;rez royo , the situation of farmers in andalusia , finland and france reflects what jaur&egrave;s said about money being the blood of the poor .
just look how we have forgotten what history has taught us !
we have already had a single currency in europe and throughout the world : the gold standard .
but it did not stop deflation .
the great depression in america happened at a time when it had a fixed exchange rate with the gold standard .
i know that i will not convince you , mr de silguy , since this is a religious question .
at least we shall know what to think about the disasters it will bring in its wake .
market forces produce contaminated meal .
mr president , if we wish to have monetary union , we must combat unemployment in the european union , as is repeatedly stressed by both the european monetary institute and the commission in its annual economic report .
to my mind , however , it is not enough to carry on as before .
we need to provide greater impetus on the structural policy side , and that is why the economic policy guidelines must indeed be reoriented , as parliament is calling for today .
the house stated very early on that currencies not participating in european monetary union should be linked to it by means of an exchange-rate mechanism with the euro as its anchor-point .
fortunately the monetary institutions , as well as the commission and the council , have since come round to parliament 's position .
what kind of mechanism should this be ?
above all , we should assure the other currencies of our support and solidarity , so that they can join the monetary union as soon as possible .
in fact , as the past few years have shown , exchange-rate turbulence has a detrimental effect not only on economic growth , but also on employment .
it is therefore important to introduce an exchange-rate mechanism on these lines , in order to maintain the credibility of the initiative .
mr president , unemployment is at the moment a europe-wide problem , to which a solution is sought in all member states of the european union .
unemployment does however not a constitute a barrier to joining the emu , since emu not only improves competition but also increases demand , which helps maintain employment .
emu reduces sharp economic fluctuations , lowers the interest rate particularly in smaller european countries and increases trade within the internal market .
there is no short-cut to employment and it is not improved by short-term measures .
economic and monetary union is a natural extension to the internal market , since full benefit from the internal market can only be achieved through co-operation and convergence within economic and monetary union .
it is true that the implementation of the third stage of monetary union within the schedule set in the maastricht treaty is uncertain , due to economic problems .
however , a postponement of the third stage and the postponement decision in itself will slow down the recovery of the european economy , keep interest rates high and cause great economic uncertainty .
by fulfilling the emu criteria stability can be achieved .
the political decision-making within the economy , regarding both exchange rates and interest rates , will decrease , and this reduces the benefits of not joining the third stage .
after emu 's third stage , currency policy will be of general concern to member states .
price stability has to be regarded as an essential objective both within and outside monetary union .
countries outside the emu should receive help from the system to join at a later date , and the system should not complicate activities in the internal market or the european central bank 's monetary activities .
from the point of view of emu support , it is important for the commission to define the currency rules for the countries staying outside the emu during the course of the current year .
i hope that the commissioner will see that this is implemented and aim at finding a solution to the situation as soon as possible .
the rapporteurs ' views on the current situation of the emu and on the preparatory stage prior to progressing towards a common currency are realistic .
mr president , in april 1996 the european monetary institute published its annual report for 1995 .
the institute 's report , like the rapporteur 's resolution , goes in the right direction from the point of view of our group , with one slight exception .
in fact in one of the recitals the motion for a resolution notes a contradiction between the emi and the european commission with regard to their explanations of the economic fluctuations which were so evident in 1995 .
in this general outline our group welcomes the report by mr p&eacute;rez royo , which puts the emphasis on the efforts in terms of convergence and budgetary discipline , which alone are able to prevent monetary fluctuations .
in conclusion , we believe that the system of monetary cooperation is not the competence of the commission and the emi alone , but also the competence of the council , the emi and the commission respectively .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to make a specific comment on behalf of my group on the p&eacute;rez royo report .
first of all we doubt just how effective such a tax would really be , and it is not even a good idea in the first place . why can we not introduce this tax ?
because we could not limit it to currency market transactions , otherwise the speculators would simply turn to other financial transactions such as derivatives .
mr president , one more voice , one more minute . so that once more it can be made clear that the so-called path of consensus is not actually a path of consensus at all .
what was decided about emu and a single currency at maastricht was not set in concrete .
reality has shown that the planned path cannot be achieved .
to change our economic policy to one where the single currency has its rightful place of monetary instrument and the objective is improving social conditions .
and now , in italy , all we hear about is the re-entry of the lira into the european monetary system as soon as possible .
that does not , however , mean that the socialist group agrees with all that is set down in the 1995 report or , indeed , the rapporteur 's gloss on it .
in many areas the report adumbrates ideas given wide currency in the commission 's annual economic report , on which parliament has already pronounced .
some differences between these two snapshots emerge however .
the emu idiosyncratically scarcely mentions the shaky state of consumer and business confidence as a significant contributing factor in the current and recent economic slowdown .
as a consequence , it omits to highlight the need for active measures , including the judicious use of monetary policy to prompt recovery of business and consumer confidence .
similarly , the doubtful observation that percentage rates of public expenditure were unacceptably too high , was only half-heartedly qualified by mr lamfalussy when he came under fire in parliament 's subcommittee on monetary affairs recently .
finally , the emi report failed to point a finger of blame at the rigid monetary policies pursued by some national monetary authorities whose effect in the real economy has been so deleterious .
socialist amendments underscoring some of these sins of omission and commission have been incorporated in parliament 's report .
i am also pleased that future emi reports will contain more detailed analyses and evaluations of the effect of the exchange-rate fluctuations on the economy .
secondly , mr lamfalussy has promised that he and his successor are prepared to issue half-yearly reports on the emi 's preparatory work for emu .
this will give greater transparency to the emi 's work and that , in turn , will benefit us all .
mr president , on a point of order .
every speech that i have sat through this morning has been extended one way or another through your incompetence in the chair .
it is no good exhorting people to shorten their speeches .
you are in the chair on behalf of parliament to shut people up when they go over time , because they transgress on other people 's democratic rights to speak in this parliament .
could you wake up and do something about it ?
mr president , if everyone keeps to what has been agreed , not just here in parliament but everywhere else , then economic and monetary union will be in place by 1999 .
next comes the man in the street . we are going to have to earn his trust in practical ways , by meeting the criteria and by providing proper information from now to 2002 .
the treaty states that the central banks must make themselves independent of the decision-making powers of their governments and parliaments by 1 january 1999 at the latest .
at the same time , the institutions of the escb , the european central bank and the central banks , are not to take any further instructions .
this is often referred to in the press as the sixth convergence criterion .
the majority of the national central banks do not yet meet the independence requirements , and far too little progress is being made here .
finland , greece , ireland , italy , portugal and sweden have done particularly badly .
and even once a bank is formally declared independent , it may take a considerable time before it develops its own tradition of independent decision-making .
the independence of the future european central bank would provide a sound basis on which its president could build a reputation for reliability .
i should therefore like to ask mr lamfalussy two questions .
what does he think in general terms of the progress made by the central banks towards independence ? and does he see the french proposal as a restriction on the independence of the central bank in particular ?
do mr waigel 's ' stability pact ' and other similar proposals also imply restrictions on the independence of the central bank ?
this was the system used by the german central bank , the bundesbank , and according to reports it worked successfully in only ten years out of twenty .
mr president , thankfully we live in a community where the weapons of war these days are economic rather than military .
it is important that we seize the opportunity to get our economies together to prevent future conflict .
it is a bit like the difference between nuclear fusion and nuclear fission .
we all know that nuclear fission is an inherently dangerous process , as indeed is a fission in our economies .
i belong to a tradition of a party in great britain which has always believed in the united kingdom 's full participation in economic and monetary union .
indeed , one of the more eminent members of my party , mr roy jenkins , in his time as president of the commission , was one of the main proponents of currencies coming together .
i am proud to be in that tradition , to stand against the prevailing government policy and sentiment in my country .
mr von wogau said that perhaps it would be better if the uk did not join a single currency .
i beg to disagree with him .
i am arguing very strongly in my country that we should join a single currency .
it is important for us irrespective of its importance to the european union as a whole .
on black wednesday in september 1992 we saw the immense damage that can be done by great devaluations of currency .
in his report , mr p&eacute;rez royo talks about the growth in italian competitiveness through the short-term devaluation .
one can also look at the growth in uk competitiveness and the damage it did to the french and belgian economies .
i do not agree with him that we need a tax on currency speculation but certainly we need to avoid this kind of movement .
finally , i am arguing in my country that the logical consequence of an opt-out from the single currency is a lockout from the single market .
countries cannot co-exist in a single market with partners who reserve the right to indulge in competitive devaluations to gain short-term advantage over their neighbours .
if we live in a union it is a union where solidarity in these matters must prevail .
this is a political and not a technical problem .
that is the point !
that is why i think it would be a mistake to make the maastricht criteria stricter , as some would wish .
what we actually need is to revert to an intelligent reading of article 104c which says , among other things , that public investment needs to be rid of deficit - and that is a basic factor .
the commission and council must do more here .
mr president , honourable colleagues .
it is obvious that the new jobs and sectors of the future are not thriving in today 's eu .
even for those countries which will not qualify for the first round of emu the process has resulted in a thorough and in many cases necessary revision of the economy .
for it is to be hoped that we have come to the end of the era in which budgets could be expanded and politicians could buy popularity by shifting the burden of debt irresponsibly onto future generations .
much remains to be done , however , as part of a structural revision , responsibility for almost all of which lies with the individual countries .
as regards the union , and not least us here in parliament , it is a question of gearing our work to deregulation and not to new expensive regulations which hinder development .
i would stress what is said in the guidelines , namely the need to reduce expenditure and the fact that increased taxation is not an alternative , particularly with a view to our competitiveness .
we must thus forcefully reject increased taxes , european taxes and in particular the proposed tobin taxes .
there are no quick and easy solutions to the problem of unemployment .
the old structural problems in europe cannot be ignored .
the omissions of many years must be dealt with in the short term if we wish to retain our prosperity .
and we have white papers , essen conclusions , these guidelines - which is to say that the conclusions and the direction to take are clear .
i should now like to hear fewer fine words and see more concrete evidence that the leaders of the eu are really serious about their goal of halving unemployment .
this approach could take us straight to the wall .
look at what is happening in germany , belgium and france .
we cannot have a single currency if we do not have the support of public opinion .
the currency has no virtue in itself , but it has a vital political dimension and represents part of what it is to be european .
what is more , experience has shown us that in industry for example , excessive belt-tightening can be counterproductive in that it destroys the social cohesion which everyone agrees is a vital element in being competitive .
this is also true of the macro-economy , but its importance is underestimated , and i therefore wonder what mr de silguy means when he recommends ' suitable ' wage increases .
in his preliminary remarks , mr lamfalussy told us that we should seek to get to grips with the serious problems facing us .
but if we are to do so , we cannot accept the economic guidelines being proposed by the council and the commission .
in particular , the council must agree to adopt and finance the 14 major infrastructure projects proposed by jacques delors , which parliament has called for time and time again .
on the jobs front , our structural policy must be to reduce working hours .
i have one comment on the report by mr p&eacute;rez royo .
his proposal for a tax on currency speculation is absolutely vital for the system we wish to introduce , and europe should take the initiative on this subject at the next g7 meeting .
finally , while we are in favour of monetary stability , it is our political responsibility to condemn the conditions under which the council and the commission expect us to pursue this objective .
the commission 's economic guidelines are unacceptable , and have been made even more so by the ecofin council .
they merely demonstrate that our executive bodies have caved in to monetarist pressure , and they play into the hands of those who oppose the single currency .
mr president , what message do europeans have for our almost 18 million unemployed people ?
are we able to solve real problems , instead of simply making solemn declarations ?
new jobs in the environmental sector , social services and information and communications technology are not enough in themselves .
disputes over competence will not take us any further forward .
only when measures at european level are coordinated with those of the member states will effective results be achieved .
jacques santer 's confidence pact on employment in no way impinges on the legitimate aim of subsidiarity .
a chapter on employment in the new eu treaty will not in fact create a single extra job , but the foundations are being laid for an active policy on employment .
after all , the commission is supposed to complement , not replace , measures taken by the member states .
it is therefore not a question of new programmes costing millions , but rather of jointly agreed resources , such as the structural funds , being coordinated so as to enhance their effectiveness .
the european council in essen took the first real steps by establishing five areas for action .
the madrid council then decided to reduce regional imbalances , not least as a means of combating long-term unemployment .
research and development must be strongly promoted , alongside small and medium-sized enterprises , which provide the bulk of the jobs and traineeships in europe .
we need more flexible working hours , greater investment in training and further training , the introduction of lifelong learning and more generally a policy of stability .
the convergence criteria and the third stage of economic and monetary union must be adhered to .
as a hard currency , the euro will help to boost investment and to create new jobs in europe .
the social market economy is and will remain europe 's number one export in intellectual terms .
but both parts must be in harmony : the economic part , with an increase in competitiveness , and the social part , which must never be allowed to fall by the wayside .
our model is based on consensus , not on confrontation .
the alliances on employment which should be pursued and respect for the interests of the social partners belong in this context .
at the same time we have within the maastricht treaty a timetable laid down for monetary union which we need to stick to .
indeed until recently the growth projections of both the commission and the oecd suggested we could still possibly complete that task of getting millions of people back to work by the year 2000 .
what concerns me is the revision that has taken place on those growth figures and the likely impact on jobs .
modest growth in itself will not bring those jobs .
we know that growth does not guarantee jobs but without growth jobs will not be created at all .
mr santer came to us with a package of confidence-creating measures which at the moment seems to many like a confidence trick .
what we need are the measures outlined in our resolution in order to see the real growth and the real jobs that we need in europe so desperately .
mr president , i have listened carefully to the speeches of all those have taken part in this debate , and i was particularly struck by mr de silguy 's comments .
the spanish delegation supports the establishment of an exchange-rate mechanism which encourages the convergence of those countries which do not participate in the third stage of emu from the outset and protects their currencies from external pressures .
however , it does not - and will never - support the introduction of penalties which make convergence more difficult and impede the entry of those countries which initially remain outside the hard core .
the first thing we might expect the broad economic guidelines to do is to set a course for achieving adequate growth in the short term .
it is therefore quite astonishing to realize that neither the version put forward by the commission nor the ecofin version actually does this .
what is worse , if we followed today 's recommendations to the letter , our already stagnating growth would be slowed still further .
clearly , the idea that 90 % of the union 's gross national product is earned within the union itself and only 10 % through external trade has not yet got through to everyone .
from the 10 % of gnp which we earn from exports outside the union , against a background of strict monetary policy geared towards lower inflation , when the bis is already warning against deflation ?
by refusing to take advantage of the flexibility built into the emu criteria and imposing an unnecessarily severe programme of belt-tightening on all the member states , which would run counter to present economic trends ?
and by curbing wages in all the member states , so that there is little growth in internal purchasing power and therefore in intra-european exports ?
when our joint resolution says that the approach adopted by the commission and the council is unrealistic and inadequate , we are really understating the case .
it is actually a danger to the union , and must therefore be rejected .
mr president , we are here to discuss a common project , the single european currency , and its next stage .
a precondition for the progress of emu is that european citizens have confidence that it is justifiable .
large member states play a significant role in this .
the interest rate is a good example of the above .
the interest rate of the anchor currency will have to be lowered before interest rates in my own country , finland for example , can decrease , even though finland has the lowest inflation rate in europe .
finland has discussed joining the european exchange rate mechanism .
this lead to a collapse of the entire erm , and the weak ones are still struggling with high unemployment as a consequence .
in emu discussions we are talking about necessary savings within the public sector .
with regard to emu 's progress it is important that this concept is not misunderstood .
public savings should not mean that everybody is saving - on the contrary .
the private sector in particular , where there is money , should invest and also spend .
this serves to bring about an equilibrium in the public sector , more jobs are created , more tax revenue is collected and there are fewer costs related to unemployment .
namely , the relations between the member states in the first group and those which remain outside .
we have before us a first class report , and i would like to congratulate mr von wogau on the intellectual range that he has displayed in producing it .
however , various points have remained unclarified in this debate and i will recall them for you now .
the waigel pact makes things worse , and it matters not whether those in the first group agree on it .
what matters is that it will worsen the situation and make things much more difficult for the countries in the following group .
and , of course , that is just as it should be .
no one would wish to see the stability of the euro threatened in the very early days or to see it sacrificed on the altar of stability for the currencies which are temporarily outside .
however , there is no reason why it should ever come to that , because each intervention by the central bank in support of a currency can be sterilized .
the essential element is equitable apportionment of the interest cost , of the cost of interest rate changes , so that the economies of the countries which have remained outside are not excessively burdened .
i would like the commission and the european monetary institute to take note of this point .
none of these remedies has worked .
and , lastly , the intergovernmental conference must give europe a social and , above all , a political dimension .
an economic europe which is soon to have its own single currency will really need political government by a governing body .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i have listened very carefully to what you have said , and i have learned a great deal .
on the subject of ems ii , i would confirm what mr de silguy said : that there are not one , but two objectives .
one is to ensure that the single market is able to function properly .
the other is to prepare the way for those who are provisionally outside the system to join the first team .
what we are all wondering is whether there is really any hope that ems ii will achieve these two objectives after the serious crisis that the first ems went through in 1992 and 1993 ?
my reply to this is simply that there is hope , for a number of reasons .
first , do not think that the 1992-1993 crises marked the collapse of the ems .
the ems did not collapse , though it was certainly badly shaken .
but the countries which remained in the ems experienced far less turbulence in their exchange rates than those outside the system .
third , the convergence process is considerably further advanced than it was at the time of the crises in 1992-1993 .
fourth , there is still talk of the danger of ' asymmetric ' crises .
we have already had one , in the shape of german unification , but it is not something which is likely to be repeated , or at least i hope not .
furthermore , i would point out that the danger in the past has not come from ' asymmetric ' crises , but from the asymmetric nature of the reactions to them , particularly the political repercussions .
think of how chaotic the reactions were to the oil crises in the 1970s .
finally , a few words about unemployment .
in every speech i have made , i have always recognized the fundamental importance of tackling the unemployment problem .
i have never concealed my concern about this , nor do i intend to do so .
if there is such a temptation , it is misleading in that it does not correspond to what actually happened .
mr president , you have anticipated the point of order i wished to make .
i welcome the fact that mr lamfalussy has made his closing comments but i must insist that the house also hear the other institutions .
we have asked direct questions and we should have direct answers before we go to vote .
it is rather difficult for me to answer all the individual points ; i shall therefore focus on a number of general considerations .
we shall have therefore to find a way of involving the european parliament , but also the national parliaments , in the decision-taking processes of the european community .
this is not an artificial concession but a real need to which it is in all our interest to respond through the appropriate institutional changes , which are , in any case , being considered by the intergovernmental conference .
if that process is to be pursued in a resolute and credible manner , the priority objective of reducing levels of unemployment is both a necessary and a consistent one .
a stable macro-economic framework is not then of itself enough to guarantee the creation of new jobs .
if we are bring down unemployment to a reasonable level , we need to take more wideranging measures , of a structural nature , designed to improve the operation of the markets , in particular the labour market .
secondly , we need to increase investment in human capital which is the most important source of wealth for our continent , by strengthening and improving education systems and vocational training .
thirdly , we need specific measures to help the less-favoured groups in society : young people , women and the long-term unemployed , to make it easier for them to join or rejoin the labour market .
the issue of employment is a priority for the european union .
the tripartite conference , convened last week in rome by the italian government , showed that the broad lines of that strategy enjoy a large degree of support from the social forces .
we need to increase that support because it is vital if we are to make this strategy more effective and more vigorous .
strengthening consensus , through dialogue and consultation , underpins the confidence pact for employment launched by president santer .
we are certain that the florence european council will be able to give fresh impetus to the strategy of combating unemployment and that resolute implementation of that strategy will soon produce real results .
noninflationary macro-economic policies geared to stable growth are not incompatible with the aim of increasing employment : they are in fact the vital prerequisite for achieving that objective .
in that context , we need also to find and apply in all of the member states fiscal policies able to reduce pressure on earned income - a hope that has been expressed in the course of this debate .
that aim is not inconsistent with the need stated in the council resolution not to reduce , for the time being , overall fiscal pressure : we are talking about a targeted redistribution of the tax burden .
the objective we have set ourselves is difficult and requires a collective effort at all levels , but it is essential , and the future of the european union depends on its achievement .
i should like to thank the president-in-office .
commissioner de silguy will now take the floor on behalf of the commission .
on the single currency , i feel we should put an end to all the doubts and misunderstandings .
there is no doubt that the euro will enter circulation on 1 january 1999 .
to prepare for the euro , we must of course carry on with the work on convergence , as we discussed at length this morning .
we also need to set up a second european monetary system .
it simply said that it would agree to a request from a number of member states to carry out a study on the subject , which is not the same thing at all .
i would add that the policies we pursue here must be both credible and socially acceptable .
these are two very important points .
we also need to introduce statutory regulations for the euro ; you should receive the commission 's proposal shortly .
such regulations are essential if we are to provide the legal security which operators , firms and the markets in general demand of us .
moving on now to employment , this is a subject to which we should devote all our energies .
it is a political priority , and as such should be the focus of our concern .
when the commission presented its broad economic guidelines , i told you that they were based on three vital elements : growth , stability and employment .
if deficits created jobs , then europe would probably be suffering from over-employment at the moment .
the euro is another subject on which we need to eliminate misunderstandings .
the euro will mean less unemployment , simply because it will mean healthier public finances .
the euro will also put an end to currency fluctuations , and on this point i share many of the concerns expressed this morning .
i would point out that in 1995 , currency fluctuations cost europe half a percentage point of growth and one and a half million jobs .
so here too , the euro should make a big difference to our unemployment problem .
i am quite aware that although the euro itself may be a vital element , it is still not enough on its own and further measures are needed .
this is where the structural policies come in , but these are primarily the responsibility of the member states , with europe merely providing the leverage .
president santer 's proposals to be discussed at florence adopt this same line .
let me just mention three other points which i feel are important , and which reply to some of the questions raised this morning .
one of mr santer 's proposals is to exploit the potential of the single market by making small and medium-sized firms more competitive .
there are also proposals for reforming the employment systems , and although the main burden here again rests with the member states , the union can still act as a very useful lever .
the measures we are taking are thus coherent , comprehensive and carefully thought out , and they need firm support if we are to restore confidence and return to growth .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
votes
madam president , as rapporteur i wish to say how disappointed i am at the vote on amendment no 1 and i think this house will have cause to feel ashamed about that .
as a fall back , at least we can adopt amendment no 5 , which puts in the word ' substantial ' which has no legal force .
but at least let us put it in .
so i support amendment no 5 , although it is very much weaker and this house has just made a fool of itself .
( the president declared the common position adopted as amended )
madam president , i have a comment to make about the voting order .
i would ask all members who think we need to find a solution to the backlog to take another close look at amendments nos 59 and 60 .
madam president , the amendments by the committee on transport and tourism certainly do not depart further from the text than the others , since they do no more than restore the commission 's original wording .
( in successive votes , parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions )
i think we can vote on the report and the amendment together - given that there are no other amendments - but i should like to clarify the following technical point .
consequently , we should vote on the report and amendment together , but we should not vote on the second part of the paragraph in question .
that will leave us with the following :
' stresses the need for a balanced policy mix ' .
madam president , i think our translators do an excellent job , but on this occasion i would like to ask for the dutch version of the report by mr gas&ograve;liba to be revised again .
there are four translation errors , all stemming from the same problem .
' fiscal policy ' is translated as ' fiscaal beleid ' instead of ' begrotingsbeleid ' .
and ' fiscal consolidation ' is wrongly translated in three places as ' fiscale consolidatie ' .
thank you , mrs thyssen .
we shall not only make the corrections , but ensure that these mistakes do not occur again in future .
( since no members opposed the tabling of the oral amendment , the president put it to the vote )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
this is an excellent report which proposed to make a concrete difference by its proposal for energy efficiency which in helping to reduce carbon dioxide emissions also addresses climate change .
linkohr report
i cannot support the eu investing a great deal of money in research which is not in line with the greens ' proposals .
the research includes aerospace research , as the text states that air traffic will double within the next 15 years .
flying is not an environmentally friendly form of transport .
more resources should rather be made available for research in the fast train industry .
it is true that this is also included in the proposal but i would like to increase its share considerably .
there are many areas and objectives that i approve of , however , and i support the amendments , for example the reduction of the appropriation for nuclear safety by ecu 10 million .
unfortunately , experience shows that this money contributes to the continued use of nuclear energy and gives the impression , in the eastern european countries as well as elsewhere , that nuclear power is safe .
nuclear power is not safe and we should instead invest money in renewable sources of energy in order to get away from nuclear power .
i am voting against amendments nos 50 and 51 because they do not take money away from euratom .
i support amendments nos 55-57 because they ensure that euratom money goes into support for renewable sources of energy .
on the occasion of the refinancing of the fourth framework programme , commissioner cresson has altered the political objective of european research for integration and cohesion and geared it to new purposes :
i would like to suggest that we use this opportunity to take a further step forward by earmarking a percentage of the total budget for projects involving a technological challenge , the so-called ' challenge-led ' projects .
a ' challenge-led ' project is characterized by :
examples of challenge - but these are examples only - are :
the commission should not drag its feet , content to do only what it is well-equipped and knows how to do .
if we want to keep pace with innovation , we must be prepared continually to re-invent ourselves .
it is good to have the task forces for the time being !
but i must point out that the area of technological r & d is particularly important for countries like portugal .
by introducing the notion of task forces , interesting in fact in terms of principles , the commission has somehow undermined the balance struck when defining the 4th fp .
all member states must have a voice in defining the future task forces but it is also important that the priorities already defined in the 4th programme should continue to be taken into account .
i agree with the rapporteur 's proposal to concentrate priorities or focus on such basic areas as educational multimedia and hydraulic resources .
educational multimedia is the perfect trojan horse for stating european identity and the european union must accept this and draw the necessary consequences .
the introduction of the new area of research on landmines deserves my full support .
i back the amendments referring to the multimedia priority but must stress that only the budgetary increase proposed by the committee on culture will make them operational .
i back all the amendments referring to concentrating priorities , the amendment on mines and the amendment calling for better and more permanent interdepartmental interaction .
sindal report
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the main concern of this report is to make sea transport more flexible and attractive .
there is a need to give a greater role to this mode of transport , so as to relieve pressure on the others .
however , various problems and shortcomings have come to light in the course of examining of this report , especially as regards environmental protection and safety standards .
indeed , the vessels employed in short sea shipping are particularly small and dilapidated .
the risks of an accident are therefore greater .
we must now take all these factors into account , with a view to making short sea shipping a mode of transport which is environmentally friendly and safe .
madam president , in commenting on the sindal report , i very much welcome the plans contained for a switch of 30 to 40 % of trade between spain and britain from the roads to short-sea maritime transport .
it will be good for the environment , take 0.6 million tonnes of trade off our roads and it will be six times more efficient in terms of energy usage and reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
i rise in support particularly to plead to the commission that it ensures that the port of tilbury in my constituency is at the heart of this new increased trade .
it is a port which is close to london and the major transport networks from the south-east of england to the whole of the united kingdom .
it has an unmatched range of flexible facilities .
recently it has announced a fast , daily container service to rotterdam .
it has the potential to benefit from this increased trade and i ask the commission to ensure that it does so .
after months of intensive work , mr sindal 's report is now ready for adoption by the house and , despite some criticisms , i should like to congratulate him on behalf of my group .
an intensification of coastal shipping should have positive economic effects and a dynamic impact on employment in the coastal regions of the european union , and above all in the least developed of them :
at the same time , the text comes out in favour of free competition , which is generally to be welcomed , but against any aid measures , whether direct or indirect .
the committee on transport would therefore have been well advised to devote rather more attention to that committee 's proposals , which were adopted with the strong backing of the ppe group and the support of the socialist members .
because - and here i have three questions to those present - is there any such thing as ' fair ' competition between prosperous and less-developed coastal regions , or between large and small ports ?
can it really be said that some individual member states or regional and local authorities , for example in objective 1 regions , have as much budgetary scope for the necessary modernization work as their more prosperous counterparts ?
more account should be taken in future of such imbalances and different geographical circumstances , especially in the context of transport policy .
finally , i have two further comments in support of a coherent european transport policy , as called for by most of the political groups :
the greens have voted in favour of the sindal report .
in comparison with rail and air transport , short sea shipping uses very little energy and is therefore less damaging to the environment .
my group has drawn attention to the rather surprising comparison made between road and rail transport in recital a and paragraph 6 . these two are by no means developed and subsidized to the same extent .
finally , my group was unable to support mr wijsenbeek 's amendment , which would have reopened the debate on weights and dimensions .
this is because the issue is one of the most important in the eu and one which affects all citizens of the union .
i oppose the introduction of a common currency in view of all the negative effects it will have .
my goal of an ecologically sustainable society is not compatible with emu .
in view of the above i am voting against the report in the final vote .
referring to the national compromise and the edinburgh agreement , the danish social democrats naturally cannot support those elements of this report which run counter to denmark 's four reservations .
p&eacute;rez royo report
i am voting against all of this report by mr p&eacute;rez royo because it includes so much that i cannot support .
it is primarily a question of the views expressed which pay homage to a common currency and the need for progress in the convergence process .
on the other hand , i support the idea of a tax on currency transactions because it would reduce speculation considerably .
such a tax should be introduced by countries outside the eu as well as the eu member states .
the tax should , however , not be seen as a stage in the process leading to the introduction of the common currency ; rather it should be introduced simply in order to reduce speculation .
i find the totally uncritical praise of emu , the convergence criteria and the schedule for those criteria totally incomprehensible .
i am not against the national economies of the member states being put in order but the cuts which are now resulting from the convergence policy should give cause for reconsideration .
rather than simply thinking in terms of the traditional economic objectives it is necessary to consider the new economic policy , the aim of which is an ecologically sustainable society .
this objective is not compatible with the emu project which must therefore be stopped .
referring to the national compromise and the edinburgh agreement , the danish social democrats naturally cannot support those elements of this report which run counter to denmark 's four reservations .
although it contains a number of good proposals , such as the tax on currency transactions , we are voting against the report because we are against the entire emu project .
the report contains many good proposals , for example in paragraph 4 , which states that a tax on currency speculation would be an effective way of stabilising exchange rates .
i am nevertheless abstaining because so many paragraphs of the report recommend completion of monetary union and the establishment of a new erm .
i believe that a new exchange rate mechanism will encourage speculation and could result in the same kind of economic disaster we experienced in 1992 .
this is why i have chosen to abstain .
von wogau report
however , there can be no-one who does not know that outside the eu institutions there is considerable doubt about the splendid qualities of emu , the schedule for emu and the convergence criteria .
this criticism comes from politicians , economists , bankers and trades unionists .
demonstrations in belgium , france and germany bear indisputable witness to the social unrest which the convergence criteria are causing among ordinary people .
naturally all countries must make every effort to pursue sound economic policies .
however , this requires healthy development , not constant growth which adds to the growing environmental deficit .
it also requires fair distribution of common resources and policies which prevent social exclusion and unemployment .
with emu , however , the eu has established an economic policy which puts price stability and balanced budgets above all else , which may entail cuts in public services and cause many more jobs to disappear .
from a democratic point of view the european central bank is unacceptable .
the von wogau report speaks of accountability but the truth is that it is impossible to impose accountability on the decision-makers .
the six members of the european central bank 's board cannot be removed in the course of the eight years for which they have been appointed .
emu is to be administered by experts over whom no political control will be possible .
economic and monetary union thus faces far too many unsolved problems and risks becoming a political owngoal , far removed from the real world and economic realities .
as the idea of an economic and monetary union is basically a federal one and conflicts with our belief in the creation of a europe of democracies , we will abstain from voting on this report .
allowing monetary policy to be determined by officials at the european central bank is not in accordance with our view that economic policy should be governed by the people through their elected representatives .
on a separate point , it may be noted that during the membership negotiations sweden made a unilateral declaration that we would decide for ourselves whether we would participate in emu or not .
the legal validity of this declaration is doubtful but the political view is that it is the swedish people who will decide on emu membership .
as far as sweden is concerned the matter has by no means been decided .
as an opponent of the entire emu project i am voting against this report by mr von wogau .
there are some good amendments , which i support , but they do not outweigh all the less satisfactory parts of the report which remain .
i do not support the establishment of an exchange rate mechanism for the common currency in the present situation .
each country must bear responsibility for and be able to pursue its own economic policy , which takes into account the conditions in that particular country and the country 's industrial structure .
this will be made impossible by participation in emu .
it is naturally desirable that exchange rates fluctuate as little as possible .
this is not only true with regard to the eu 's member states , however , but also with regard to those countries outside the union , of which there are far more .
the report is permeated by the demand that the convergence criteria should be implemented .
in view of the massive cuts which many of the eu member states are now being forced to make or will make , there should be some pause for thought .
rather than fostering the expansion of social welfare emu policy is now resulting in the dismantling of the welfare system in country after country .
this is not a policy i can support .
as i oppose the entire emu project i am voting against the von wogau report .
i followed the debates this morning carefully .
at no point was there any mention of the fears of the citizens of the member states with regard to the single currency .
our political leaders , the commission in brussels , deliberately encourage confusion between a single currency and a common currency .
clearly , the people of europe find it hard to tell the difference .
for example , if you talk to french people about a european currency , or indeed a single currency , they think you mean a common currency , and seem to be in favour of it .
but if you clearly explain to them what is at stake , they are against it .
when they realize that the introduction of the euro will mean the disappearance of their national currency , they oppose it - and they are right .
why ?
the people of europe have a deep emotional , psychological and practical attachment to their national currencies .
depriving them of a reference point as essential as their national currency would undermine them psychologically .
in the words of general de gaulle , the currency links the citizen to the nation .
i voted against the von wogau report because , as a convinced european , i believe that europe must not be built on a massive lie .
since maastricht , there has been a growing suspicion on the part of people in europe that partisan economic interests are increasingly taking hold of the process of building europe .
in this crisis of credibility in the eu , those who had been relying on the monitoring and corrective powers of the european parliament have been deeply disappointed for months now .
it is becoming increasingly apparent that the convergence criteria for monetary union are a vehicle for the destruction of welfare standards in the member states .
the pressure to achieve the criteria simultaneously and as soon as possible has begun to have a recessionary effect and is leading to a sharp increase in unemployment .
yet people in the european union are waiting in vain for the eu institutions to reform these criteria , which have long since become socially irresponsible .
this inconsistency is heightened by the lack of any social initiatives at european level .
that concludes voting time .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.12 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
fisheries
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we are debating the crisis in the community 's fishing industry .
this economic , social and ecological crisis is affecting the entire sector .
for a number of years now , we have been obliged to cut back on catch authorizations , apply more effective controls , reduce fleet sizes and step up structural and social accompanying measures .
at the same time , although the amounts of fish caught have decreased - in my own country , for example - many species have suffered the effects of international market forces .
in certain regions of europe , fresh fish prices have fallen by an average of 25 % .
' blue europe ' is a fragile common policy because it is incomplete .
all europe 's coastal regions are looking to the future with concern .
by chance , commissioner , our respective timetables meant that we learnt your response a few days after this report went to print and after our seminar in quimper .
consequently , our committee has not yet been able to debate the fourth multiannual guidance plan which you are submitting .
certainly , we were expecting a message of vision , but we were also expecting one of confidence .
this is a very hard blow to the economic and social activity of the whole sector .
i am convinced that we must now display not only vigilance and firmness , but also imagination and political will as regards a number of new proposals which are capable of restoring confidence to the sector .
i shall restrict myself to dealing with three key points , concerning resources , the markets and structural policies .
as far as resources are concerned , we are aware that sacrifices will still have to be made .
so let us adopt stricter technical measures which genuinely make it possible for resources to be renewed .
we refer in the report to the use of square meshes and more selective fishing gear , and to the protection of zones in which juveniles are concentrated .
we propose the introduction of biological rest periods when species are particularly under threat .
however , commissioner , the fisheries committee also refers to the need for financial compensation .
the commission 's reply will be that the common fisheries policy does not provide for this type of funding , save in very exceptional cases .
' no support for incomes ' , you will say .
i do not believe that i make populist speeches very often : i will not conceal the difficulties , but i cannot accept that the sacrifices should be one-sided .
if we have the money to compensate for the destruction of a vessel , then we should also be able to find the money to conserve resources .
in order to produce maximum effect , all these technical measures must be underpinned by constant and increasingly in-depth scientific research and far more rigorous controls .
hence it is essential not only to encourage those directly involved in the sector to assume their responsibilities , but also to equip ourselves with new means of surveillance .
with regard to the markets , i should like to point out firstly that the internal european fisheries market is heavily dependent on imports , both for consumption and supply to the processing industry .
the industry as a whole must improve its systems of information and communication .
the modernizing of the industry is vital in today 's world .
we also believe that it is important to involve producers more closely in the distribution sector , as well as to exploit the quality and the origin of fisheries products .
however , commissioner , i do not believe that the ' blue europe ' of 2002 will be able to make do with such a weak ' market ' aspect .
here too , i know that you will say : ' but that is a form of income support !
time will not allow me to elaborate on my third key point , which relates to structural policies .
this social dimension cannot be passed over in silence : it exists and must be adequately supported .
i have already overrun my speaking time , commissioner .
i would simply say , in conclusion , that we shall be equal to the task in terms of vigilance and firmness .
we shall need courage too , but we shall discuss this guidance plan again .
to my mind , it is unacceptable , both with regard to production and the sector as a whole ; we must take more imaginative measures , and certainly give more financial support .
it is well known that since the creation of nafo in 1978 , the european union 's fisheries relations with canada have passed through times of extreme tension .
the most recent fisheries conflict between the european union and canada - and unfortunately the one which perhaps gained the most international attention - was that popularly known as the ' halibut war ' .
the facts are well known to everyone , but perhaps now is the time - with the benefit of distance - to examine in depth the reasons which led to this conflict .
furthermore , it should be remembered that in 1994 , the canadian parliament unilaterally adopted a law on the protection of coastal fishing waters , granting powers of control beyond the 200-mile limit .
this law was subsequently invoked as the legal basis for making unjustified seizures .
a number of conclusions can be drawn from what i have described .
consequently , the fact that canada has softened its hostile attitude with a measure limited to opening up its ports is not , in our view , enough to allow a comprehensive framework of normal relations to be established .
similarly , the proposal seeks to incorporate into community legislation the provisions adopted by the commission for the conservation of antarctic marine living resources at its meetings in hobart of 8 november 1994 and 3 november 1995 .
its decisions were to be based on advice from biologists , with the countries ' own biologists also taking part in the ibsfc .
this form of cooperation has worked extremely well , though there were some difficulties during the communist regimes in the baltic states and poland .
conservation policy has been based on the usual principles : an assessment of catches and the state of juvenile stocks , with quotas being allocated accordingly to the various countries .
in addition , of course , there are the other technical measures such as mesh size and so on .
the report which is before the house today concerns the approval or rejection of a decision which was taken last year and applies to 1996 .
in its report , the committee on fisheries criticizes the fact that we are being consulted so late in the day .
i hope that the commissioner will try to ensure in future that these decisions are forwarded to us somewhat earlier .
it would also be a good idea if the commission were to invite some members of the committee on fisheries as observers to the preliminary negotiations which begin in warsaw in september .
in my report , there are one or two proposals for the forthcoming negotiations in the ibsfc .
what i have tabled in the report are amendments for the future .
amongst other things , they seek to introduce conservation measures which are different from those used in the past .
thus i am proposing the introduction of a limit on the engine power of vessels , such as 400 horsepower for vessels fishing cod and salmon .
the reason why i am making the proposal now is that the commission should be aware that poland , the baltic states and russia are in the process of modernizing their fleets .
if these fleets are modernized to include large vessels which are too effective , it will not be possible for fish stocks in the baltic to be maintained .
i am also proposing this because the fisheries policy which has been pursued in the baltic sea has not produced an increase in fishery resources .
the stocks of cod , for example , are even lower than they were in 1984 .
i also have something to say as regards the quota policy .
i think i can promise the commissioner that fish stocks would not fall , but on the contrary would increase .
so the fish are never left in peace in these areas .
furthermore , as a suggestion to the commission , some of the areas should perhaps be protected during the spawning period , so that there is no fishing at that time .
if you are a hunter , you do not hunt game during the breeding season , and the same principle should in fact be introduced in fisheries .
finally , i should like to say that i hope we can have a debate on how this instrument can be applied .
i am not a supporter of quotas , because they criminalize fishermen , even if the aim of conserving fishery resources is a very good one .
so i do not think that our fisheries policy should be based on the machiavellian idea that the end justifies the means .
the means cannot be to turn people into criminals .
i should like to thank the commission and the members of the committee on fisheries for their cooperation .
well then , mr president , we need reform of the common fisheries policy , and are very much persuaded that the texts that have been submitted represent a step in that direction .
we are hoping for a reform that takes account of new environmental balances , that seeks to retain employment in the sector and also takes account of the capacity needed to meet consumer requirements .
the socialist group will be tabling its own text officially , on thursday , in this chamber .
we would take this opportunity to invite the representatives of the commission to take part in our initiative here , in strasbourg , on thursday .
the document put forward by mrs p&eacute;ry is a very important one , the product of the substantial experience she has gained in this sector .
we shall also have to discuss again the consolidated arrangements , so to speak , for fisheries ownership .
this also offers a way of eliminating the over-fishing that has occurred in recent years .
from that point of view , we consider that the programming document is important and when we have an opportunity of discussing it in official fora , we shall look at the substance in greater detail .
for the moment , we regret the fact that we have yet to be involved as members of parliament .
mr president , i regard the fact that a substantial debate is taking place this afternoon on the subject of fisheries as a sign of the importance of europe 's future fisheries policy .
today 's reports relate to waters from the baltic sea through the atlantic to the antarctic , showing that the fisheries crisis is a worldwide problem .
it is therefore right that we should take a global approach to the problems and how to solve them .
the way in which we manage our fish stocks will show whether or not we are capable of exploiting worldwide food resources on a sustainable basis .
the member states and the fishing industry must heed these authoritative voices .
the seas are being overfished : none of our waters will survive if they continue to be fished so intensively .
there is only one answer - fewer fishing vessels and less fishing effort , and mrs p&eacute;ry clearly endorses this approach .
restructuring must be accompanied by socio-economic measures .
even if we cannot offer all fishermen jobs at sea , we should not abandon them .
we must find them alternatives , either in the fishing industry or in another sector .
a team of community experts , led by the danish scientist hans larsen , has recently made an assessment of fish stocks , and they too have drawn attention to the critical state of affairs .
mrs bonino , you have had the courage to present a proposal which is based on a scientific recommendation that the fishing effort should be reduced by 40 % , as parliament called for back in 1990 .
we are calling on the ministers to hold a credible , down-to-earth discussion on the basis of the scientific report and mrs bonino 's proposals .
the house has taken the initiative of concentrating on fisheries today , and we have used this opportunity to bring forward some ideas on how to consolidate the common fisheries policy .
now it is up to the member states to initiate the action which is required to save the fishing industry in europe .
these are issues that must be tackled by implicating the european union 's political will and clear cooperation by the member states .
some european union countries tend to ignore the real significance of the fishery sector for the whole european economy .
yet it should be pointed out that in peripheral maritime countries fishery accounts for much economic activity and many jobs .
take the example of nafo .
my country has been fishing in that zone since the 15th century , cod in particular , the historic reason for which portugal is now the world 's biggest market for that fish .
portugal 's accession to the cfp and the nafo crisis have lead , in four years , to a 70 % reduction in the fishing fleet and the direct or indirect loss of some 12000 jobs .
i can state here that portuguese shipowners intend to continue fishing responsibly in order to conserve stocks .
they therefore agree with moves to strengthen taxation and controls carried out by the european union .
but it is difficult to understand why these controls are not carried out so intensely on ships belonging to noncommunity countries which have signed the convention .
another aspect which we should pay special attention to is that of scientific research which carries out on-going analyses of stocks and changes in their patterns .
this research should also be extended to community waters , taking into account information supplied by fishermen and producers .
take the case of sardines .
this can lead to conflicts that affect the credibility of our institutions and the union itself .
as is stated explicitly in the documents we are discussing , agreements with third countries should continue to deserve the support and full weight of the european union given their importance for supplies and safeguarding production .
i commend the value of these texts and think that they are a good starting-point for dealing with the whole problem of fishery .
mr president , when the commission report on the crisis in the fishing industry came out in 1994 , as mrs pery has reminded us so well in her report , it was primarily about prices .
what do we have in terms of a solution ?
first , we have to scrap the common fisheries policy as it stands at the moment .
i am not in favour of renationalizing it .
that would be an extremely bad idea but we need to scrap it as it exists .
we need to make sure that we reduce this constant friction between scientific evidence , the fishing industry , member states and the commission .
that will not work .
we cannot get a sensible solution within the current legislative framework .
mr president , with regard to the report on the crisis in the fishing industry , i should like to make a number of comments .
however , we believe that the commission has drawn up proposals which it is difficult to accept .
the problems affecting the fishing industry cannot be resolved solely by dismantling the community fleet .
there is a whole series of problems which cannot be ignored , and which in my view are explained quite well in mrs p&eacute;ry 's report .
for example , the social dimension of the common fisheries policy has developed favourably in recent times , but is not commensurate with the large-scale adjustments proposed by the commission under mgp iv .
given the community 's capacity for self-supply and the present level of tariff protection , application of a prices and markets policy raises difficulties , and could perhaps lead to undesirable effects in terms of the conservation of resources .
i say this too with serious doubts in my mind .
mr president , the four reports being discussed today concern fisheries in widely different areas of the globe : the antarctic , the baltic sea , eastern canada and here in europe .
this demonstrates the wide extent and influence of eu fleets .
the common theme running through them all is the effect that the excessive amount of fishing capacity has on european fisheries .
this is probably the most important issue that faces the eu this year as it prepares the multi-annual guidance programme - the fourth one - to reduce the size of the fleets .
it is certainly the most contentious political issue .
everyone accepts that many of the eu stocks have been over-exploited .
the most effective single action that the european union can take to resolve this problem is to decrease the size of its fleet .
if this is not done , and done very soon , then the crisis in the sector can only escalate .
the ones who would suffer most would be the small boat owners , those with a small economic base and very little political clout but who , in fact , actually provide the most employment .
the decisions on how to reduce the fleet should consider not just the status of the stocks the fleet fishes but also other impacts of the fleet .
for example , some gears have a higher by-catch than others or inflict more severe damage on the sea bottom .
environmental impacts of gear are a very important factor .
similarly , in terms of the employment generated , preference should be given to vessels which provide most jobs relative to the amount of fish they catch .
in summary , the fleet reduction is urgently needed and it must be vigorously implemented .
the green group submitted amendments on this issue in committee but they were not accepted so we have re-submitted them to plenary .
i hope that they pass this time .
for unless there is a rigorous programme implemented right away then the next report on the sector may well be its obituary .
i was glad to hear mrs p&eacute;ry say that she will vigorously support efforts by the commission .
so i hope that she will support our amendment now .
the issue regarding the baltic concerns the adoption of a closed season for salmon .
the waters east of canada have seen fishing vessels from spain , france and england for hundreds of years .
they used to be one of the world 's greatest fishing grounds , which is probably why fishermen went so far under difficult conditions to fish there .
but in the 1980s the bloated size of the european fleets forced the eu to claim unilateral quotas on several stocks there .
it is unacceptable behaviour in a multilateral convention to regulate fishing .
these unilateral quotas contributed to the obliteration of some of the stocks in eastern canada ; i say ' contributed to ' for the responsibility does not actually lie with the eu alone .
canada has shown that it can actually wipe out its stocks without any help from anyone else .
but here the european fleets did help .
as regards the antarctic , the european union has no real fishing interests , at least on paper .
however , some vessels fishing down there are european vessels flying other flags and established under joint ventures .
so the long arm of the european union 's excess capacity reaches out even as far as there .
i think we should look at ways in which we can bridge the gap . i congratulate mrs p&eacute;ry .
i should also like to associate myself with the points made by mr baldarelli , mrs langenhagen , mr gir&atilde;o pereira and mr teverson .
we are all facing a common problem together .
but we have to find a solution so that we can say to our fishermen : this is a solution ; it is not being imposed on you by brussels , but it is in your interests .
mr president , i should like to congratulate mrs p&eacute;ry on her thorough and discerning analysis of the causes of the serious crisis currently affecting the community 's fishing industry .
unfortunately , the commission communication on which this report is based fails to put forward any proposals commensurate with the scale of the crisis .
it recommends a policy which is more stopgap than imaginative , more resigned than determined .
this policy seems to be based on a fatalistic premise : that the disappearance of the community fishing fleet , overseen by the cfp , is inevitable .
however , europe 's fishermen are expecting a different message .
that is the message which i propose we send to all the communities throughout europe which depend on fishing , by adopting the amendments that i have tabled on behalf of my group .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , in her report , mrs p&eacute;ry analyses in detail the causes of the crisis in the fishing sector and attempts to provide some solutions .
unfortunately , those solutions are not enough to halt the decline in the french and community fishing industries .
the diagnosis is correct , but the proposed remedies are quite inadequate to cure such a serious illness .
and the findings are correct , particularly when it comes to condemning the deregulation of the world market without an ounce of security , the serious disturbances resulting from unfair competition , and the global downward pressure on prices .
on the other hand , the solutions proposed are not equal to the challenges to be faced .
mrs bonino , as the commissioner for fisheries , wishes to cut the community fishing fleet by 40 % , to scrap hundreds of vessels and force thousands of fishermen into retirement .
in a word , she wishes to decommission our fishing fleet in order to leave the field open for predators who use the gatt agreements for their benefit alone .
at the same time , however , mrs p&eacute;ry considers it essential to modernize the fleet with vessels using more selective fishing gear , and also wishes to dismantle tariff and customs protection .
there is a blatant contradiction here .
as with the cap , as with the disaster-stricken industries , there is no wish to see the real causes of the crisis or to tackle them .
in ten years , our dependence on fish imports has increased by 30 % ; and the processing industry depends almost entirely on imported fish .
what are these priorities ?
yes , france 's fishing industry still has a future , but it is not the fourth multiannual guidance programme which will restore confidence to 16 500 french fishermen .
they need to be listened to , supported and defended .
this is the decision that has been taken by our group , whose chairman , it should be remembered , is the son of a fisherman who was killed at sea .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am only speaking about mr arias ca&ntilde;ete 's report on the problems of the fisheries sector in the nafo regulatory zone .
in our view , this criticism is mostly justified .
however , the report focuses too narrowly on the maximizing of fishing opportunities and fails to take account of some important aspects which should certainly have been addressed in an own-initiative report of this kind .
it is true that the new inspection arrangements are costly , but they are obviously working and have , above all , helped to defuse the situation .
far fewer infringements have been detected than before , and so the potential for conflict between the parties to the agreement has been much diminished .
it is also questionable whether different arrangements - as called for in the report - really would be more effective , or whether they might ultimately dilute monitoring practice .
to my mind , on-the-spot inspections still remain the most effective way of monitoring catches and the type of gear being used .
satellite surveillance cannot replace these inspections , but only complement them in order to determine the location of vessels , as is in fact stipulated in the nafo monitoring arrangements .
the relatively high cost of carrying out such measures should be regarded as the price to be paid for dwindling fish stocks and for past neglect .
in any event , we should like the existing nafo monitoring arrangements to be recognized as an improvement in terms of the conservation of stocks , thereby helping to safeguard fishing effort in the future .
another very important aspect which is also omitted from the report concerns the decision-making procedure in the nafo fisheries commission .
those in the know agree that the main reason for the appalling state of fish stocks in the nafo zone is the fact that the nafo decisions on management and conservation measures are not binding .
the scope for raising objections has undermined all the measures , and any party dissatisfied with the catch quota allotted to it has routinely been able to award itself higher catch quotas .
for my group , therefore , the abandonment of this objection procedure is the key to further progress in fisheries management in the nafo zone .
unless this happens , in our opinion , there would in fact be little point in putting any of the other demands into effect .
while it is true that my group 's request does not correspond to the currently accepted international principles , it would nevertheless be very appropriate in a report which in several respects takes issue with those principles .
one need only look at the proposals concerning the voting system in international organizations .
my group has tabled a number of amendments reflecting our concerns , and it is vital for them to be adopted if we are to support the report .
i therefore ask mr arias ca&ntilde;ete too to look favourably on these amendments .
now it is a question of looking to the future .
if canada really wished to permit access to its ports , it would have signed the bilateral agreement , one of the key points of which concerns precisely the normalized access of the community fleet to canadian ports .
however , canada continues to show great reluctance to ratify the agreement in question .
with regard to mrs p&eacute;ry 's report on the crisis in the fishing industry , the rapporteur deserves to be congratulated on her efforts to unite positions .
in my opinion , something is not right in this sector .
mr president , at the outset i want to congratulate all of those who have presented reports here today .
due to time restrictions i shall concentrate on the p&eacute;ry report .
the current crisis assailing the community 's fishing industry is sapping morale from the most important employment sector in peripheral coastal regions in this community , including my own country of ireland .
there are matters affecting us where short-term decisions could be taken .
what have we done about imports of salmon from norway .
we have introduced minimum import prices .
they have not worked .
what about quantity restrictions ?
what about the low cost of cod imports ?
nothing has been done there by the commission .
i believe parliament can play an important role in assisting in the restoration of confidence to an industry where morale is at its lowest .
we must point to a more positive future .
tax and quotas and not grt or carrying capacity have regulated the landings of various species over the years .
of course we are looking at technical conservation measures .
we have not been presented with specific measures as yet .
at the same time the lassen report is indirectly being presented to us and suggests we should slash the fleet by 40 % .
i would suggest to the commissioner that is not the answer .
tax and quotas are the answer .
we are unable to make our boats safer .
it is an indictment of the member states and the commission that we were unable to make our boats safer .
if we add to the grt , we cannot receive permission although we are not adding to the carrying capacity or to the landings of fish .
it makes little sense to me .
there is a crisis and the commission is adding to the crisis because of the veterinary charges to be introduced later after a short derogation period .
what is commissioner bonino doing about that ?
and what are we doing about early retirement ?
it is too horrendous to contemplate what will happen with a drastic reduction .
finally , i and many of my colleagues speak on behalf of the industry in ireland , but ms mckenna does not .
we are not prepared to share the pain .
we have shared too much pain over the years .
we have paid too great a price in ireland .
we want to ensure that irish fishermen are fairly treated in the years to come .
mr president , madam commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , with growing demand it is no surprise that the management of fishery stocks should once again be a priority in the common fisheries policy .
but we need to be aware that the problem of balanced stock management should not be the sole responsibility of the european union but should be done worldwide .
it is also important to point out , in this regard , that some of our current problems are due to the ingenuity of the commission in its negotiations with third countries .
in fact , only a few years ago we were accepting reductions in our fish quotas but these countries were increasing theirs .
that is unacceptable , because the rules must be the same for everyone .
has the commission , madam commissioner , actually assessed the economic and social effects of an almost 50 % cut in the fishery sector which represents more than 15000 jobs in portugal ?
if the issue of stocks was so serious , why is it only now that the commission is acting ?
who supplied the commission with these figures ?
what alternatives does the commission propose to fishermen , industrialists and workers and their families whose livelihood depends on portuguese fisheries ?
the p&eacute;ry report - and i congratulate mrs p&eacute;ry on its quality - seems to take a balanced look at the main issues of the common fishery policy .
however this strategy , albeit vital , has not been very transparent nor has it been applied by everyone , indeed by very many .
first of all because the decisions are very often taken on the basis of at times inadequate or distorted scientific studies which fail to take into account local reality .
also because these decisions overlook the appropriate and vital intervention of fishermen 's organisations and fail to take account of any preference trade policy for the community fisheries sector .
all of these and other facts justify and generalise climates of mistrust and conflict among fishermen and ship-owners in the member states .
against the background of a crisis in the fisheries sector , non e of this should be forgotten .
neither the commission , nor the member states , nor the government of my country .
it is therefore essential that adequate funding should be provided for detailed research .
the huge fluctuations in the annual tacs are also very damaging .
the flexibility now brought to the quota regulations through the introduction of a current account system is a step in the right direction , and the commission should actively pursue the idea of multiannual planning .
i am less enthusiastic about the calls to increase community price support .
this may limit loss of income in the short term , but in the long run the sector will be better served if the producers ' organisations themselves take measures to regulate the market .
finally , on the subject of imports from non-community countries , these are extremely important for the fish processing industry .
mr president , i want to talk mainly about mrs p&eacute;ry 's report , for which congratulations and support .
i fear i shall say some of the things that have already been said .
we have here the views of the committee on fisheries on the continuing crisis in the fishing industry .
the basic crisis has been with us for many years and it will be with us for many years more unless we do something radical about it .
in fact , it will probably become hardly worth fishermen putting to sea in many parts of the european union 's waters .
that has immense consequences , of course , not only for the fishermen but for all those involved on shore and for the consumer .
the basic reason is , of course , simple : too many boats chasing too few fish .
you can tackle this in two ways , and both need to be tackled .
the first one - too many boats - obviously needs a serious decommissioning scheme .
now some countries have put decommissioning schemes into practice ; my own country has not been serious about this and therefore is marked down for a 40 % cut .
that is not an acceptable solution for fishermen and for the people who are dependent upon them .
the other side of the problem is too few fish .
now there is much that we can do here and much that the commission and the various member states ' governments could do .
in many cases the research is already there .
mrs p&eacute;ry mentions many of the things that could be done : improvements in the gear that is used , to allow many smaller fish to escape ; improvements such as inserting square-mesh panels in nets .
there is a whole range of technical improvements that have been tried and that work .
so we need conservation areas , if you like .
we need to somehow get into being a policy which ends the practice of discards .
i do not know about other areas , but in the north sea sometimes 50 % and more of the catch of a fishing boat is discarded because it is too small , unmarketable , or whatever .
so we have a whole range of measures on both sides of the equation .
mr president , i wish to thank mrs p&eacute;ry for her report and to say that i agree with her when she implies that the common fisheries policy is just a half-baked policy .
unlike the common agricultural policy it does not have the confidence or respect either of the producers or the consumers .
in fisheries , the policy always seems to be about reducing the catch .
the european union is only 50 % selfsufficient and stocks are falling , yet prices continue to go down .
we feel more concern about cheap supplies to processors than about the income of the fishermen whose interests we are supposed to support .
this policy is doing the image of the union no good either with its own producers or abroad .
the common fisheries policy seems always to be about control but the benefits never seem to come .
the member states are unwilling to concede to the european union the full responsibility for a comprehensive policy but are always willing to blame the european union for the negative factors .
there is one thing about the commission 's proposals which i would question : why all the emphasis on tonnage if we have a quota policy which is working ?
why , if quotas are being observed , do we need such emphasis on tonnage ?
if we are serious about supervising landing and if member states cooperate , then tonnage reduction could actually be on a voluntary basis with compensation .
if we had a policy of maintaining proper prices , then lower quotas would be much more acceptable in the fishing regions .
some trade restrictions are acceptable in view of the social environmental problems that are so obvious .
if there is a precious and scarce resource , why do we exploit it and give it away at prices that are far below its real value ?
mr president , i should like to say a few words about the kofoed report on fisheries in the baltic sea .
the report has been drafted in response to a council regulation on salmon fishing entailing the further extension of the closed season in order to protect , above all , wild salmon .
they are good measures even if they do not go far enough in view of the crisis conditions which exist as far as wild salmon in the baltic is concerned .
in connection with this report the rapporteur has , however , tabled two amendments on cod fishing in the baltic .
these amendments propose replacing the existing quota system with rules on fishing boat engine power .
i do not think this is an especially good or well-thought-out idea .
the problem with the current system is that certain countries stick to their quotas while others do not do so in the same way ; what is needed therefore is better monitoring .
another problem is the level of prices for cod caught in the baltic .
i believe that a change to engine power would instead make it still more difficult to check how much fish is actually caught in the baltic .
it would also be more difficult to adjust fishing to actual stocks .
i will not vote for the proposals on engine power .
mr president , i welcome the commissioner .
it is going to be a pleasant change to hear her views rather than read about them in the financial times and the other press .
fishing in the communities is a very volatile , very political matter at the moment .
we have too many fishermen chasing too few fish .
everyone accepts that .
i think it is symptomatic of open competition , which is compounded by the increasing efficiency of our fishing vessels and particularly the gear .
indeed when i was at school we were told that the united kingdom was a lump of coal surrounded by a teeming sea of fish .
there is very little coal left in the united kingdom and if we go on using the gear we are using now then there will be very little fish either .
the union has got to call a halt to this .
we are , at the moment , in a crisis in the fishing industry in europe and particularly in the uk where the fishing fleet is the third largest within the european union .
the government is again preaching the virtues of deregulation .
we have seen in the last few weeks the effects of deregulation on the agriculture industry .
we do not want to transfer the bad practices of bse into the fishing industry by deregulating everything and believing it is the way ahead .
in an attempt to reduce the number of vessels by the doctrine of laisser faire economics the united kingdom government has left the fishing industry in britain suffering at the hands of market forces .
this is not conducive to promotion of conservation of fish stocks or to security of jobs of local fishermen , or to the livelihood and the thriving of local communities .
it is no wonder , therefore , that local communities which are totally dependent on fishing for their livelihood view the united kingdom government and others with suspicion .
the same government began decommissioning vessels as late as 1984 and offered grants in return for surrendering licence .
it is now crying out in outrage about quota-hopping .
indeed the same government which is crying out about quota-hopping is the government which , at the moment , to popularize its own party is parading its xenophobia and has started blocking european institutions .
we need action on quota-hopping but we must disassociate ourselves from the nationalistic sentiments surrounding it .
there is a solution to the problem of quota hopping : there should be some recognition and licensing done by the member states , to ensure some control of the quota-hoppers .
the fundamental problem remains that fishing stocks are becoming dangerously scarce ; europe 's fishermen are going out of business every day ; sustainable conservation needs to be promoted and enforced .
this can be helped by a reduction in the entire fleet capacity of the eu .
the three multi-annual guidance programmes have all failed to allow member states to reduce their fishing fleets .
in the uk alone it will not be possible to meet the 1996 fleet reduction requirements .
we have to deal with this problem .
we have to come forward with proper methods of conservation and proper methods of supervision .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , firstly i should like to welcome the fact that this important joint debate on four reports by the committee on fisheries is taking place .
of these four reports , two relate to the conservation of fishery resources - an issue of concern to the european union - in two areas : the baltic and the antarctic .
i also welcome the notable inclusion in the report of a call for the strengthening of fisheries agreements with third countries , both old and new .
these measures are vital , commissioner , for the improvement of the european union 's relations with canada in general , and its fisheries relations in particular .
mr president , there is no doubt in my mind , nor i am sure in colleagues ' or the commissioner 's minds , that there is a crisis of confidence in the fishing industry at the present time .
in my own country some in the fishing industry are calling for the scrapping of the common fisheries policy .
they conveniently forget what it was like before the common fisheries policy was introduced in 1983 and that at that time there were many international agreements .
fortunately we now have a policy but we all recognize that it needs to be adapted because it is not working properly .
the 40 % reduction which is being proposed at the present time may be a suggestion which is not properly understood .
people do not understand either that there are fewer and fewer fish in the sea .
but i would suggest that we must work with the fishing industry and make sure that it fully understands the problems .
i welcome the fact that the commissioner has gone round many of the ports in the community discussing the issues with the fishermen .
she has raised her own profile and that of the commission regarding fisheries and that is to be welcomed .
i hope we can look at and address properly the issue of quota hoppers .
i do not believe that quotas and the single market are compatible with each other .
that is something we must look at .
if we are going to have confidence in the industry we cannot allow quota that is allocated to one country to be fished by another country .
that is the major issue we must face .
there are many problems we must solve and i hope we can work with the commissioner to get the right messages across .
mr president , madam commissioner .
in his report mr kofoed deals with the situation of the baltic salmon in a most creditable way .
with regard to the population of wild salmon the situation is already alarming .
there is a danger that entire salmon stocks will become extinct .
wild salmon forms only 5-10 % of all the salmon in the baltic sea .
by definition wild salmon is a salmon stock from a particular river which goes back to spawn in the same river in order to reproduce .
finland , for example , now has such salmon stocks in just two rivers , tornionjoki and simojoki .
special action is required to save the wild salmon population .
the most important measures are fishing restrictions both at sea and in the spawning grounds , and the regeneration of fish stocks in order to preserve the genic genotype of wild salmon .
it is very positive that the necessity to regenerate fish stocks , an issue which is not very well known within the european union , is included in mr kofoed 's report .
another thing worth mentioning is that it is a great waste to catch wild salmon in the sea where it is half-grown , often weighing only a few kilograms .
the price of salmon consequently remains very low compared to the price a fisherman would pay the local authorities for fishing salmon in a river as a sport .
well looked-after fish stocks are of great importance to tourism in finnish lapland .
the strengthening of tornionjoki 's position as a salmon river is to be regarded as good from the point of view of both regional and environmental policy .
that is why fishing restrictions to protect wild salmon and fish stocks to secure the salmon population are required .
i feel that we are here today on the right track on this issue .
i refer to the community cod fleet . i should like to thank the committee on fisheries - and in particular mr arias ca&ntilde;ete - for adopting my amendments to this report concerning the cod fleet .
let us remember that the nafo fisheries commission fixed a tac of 6000 tonnes for cod in division 3no for 1994 , 2213 tonnes of which were allocated to the european union .
commissioner , you are well acquainted with the crisis afflicting this sector , whose fleet is in some cases confined to port for up to ten months a year .
above all , commissioner , we cannot continue to let canada pursue its eternal fisheries strategy : concealing the promotion of economic and commercial interests behind environmental arguments , whilst it destroys and exhausts its own fishery resources .
furthermore , the scientific and legal analyses have also made it crystal clear that in the ' halibut war ' , the european union and spain were entirely in the right .
as the commissioner rightly said at the time , the seizure of the ' estai ' was a case of hijacking , and canada was violating international law .
today , the claims to be protecting the environment made by the mercenary canadian fisheries minister at the time are clearly laughable .
these facts are keeping the tension alive . canada is not acting in good faith - far from it - but is maintaining its hostile attitude .
there is a need to demonstrate , even if only once , that the european union is acting in a coordinated way in the commission .
it needs to be made clear that there is institutional unity and coherence .
we must not isolate the fisheries question .
there must be unity and coherence in this respect .
we are discussing the halibut dispute , which was caused by a bad decision in the allocation of the corresponding tac quotas .
and the fact that the spanish fleet had been operating in those fishing grounds since the sixteenth century counted for nothing .
this readiness to accept intolerable decisions is astonishing .
i shall end by saying , mr president , that the other occasion on which the spanish minister in question turned the other cheek concerned the decisions taken on mad cows by mad british ministers .
mr president , i should like to congratulate mrs pery on her report .
she is right .
there is a crisis in the fishing industry of europe .
the fishermen i represent in devon are very unhappy about it .
they are not happy about quota hopping by re-flagging devices .
i welcome the commissioner 's initiatives in bringing forward ideas to try to solve that problem .
because of the volume of discards our fishermen believe there are more fish in the sea than the scientists say there are .
there is distrust of scientific advisers in this area .
there is widespread concern about industrial fishing for fishmeal , scooping out immature fish from the sea and damaging the possibilities for regeneration of the stock .
i wonder what the commissioner has to say about that particular aspect of the industry .
as for the 40 % reduction in fleet capacity , i trust this is an opening bid for debate to catch our attention .
above all we want to see fair and even-handed implementation of any measures that are agreed upon .
mr president , madam commissioner , i must first of all congratulate mrs pery on her report .
i should then like to develop two or three ideas in respect of the arias ca&ntilde;ete report .
first of all , i think that this report will be a reference text marking - i am quite certain - the line to be taken by the union in respect of nafo .
fishing communities by their very nature are located in the most peripheral parts of europe .
in these areas the only indigenous resources that can be fully utilized are the fish in our waters .
current policy , however , places limits on the degree to which this resource can be exploited .
now we all accept that fishing activity must be limited in line with declining resources , but the commission 's proposals are unfair and contradictory .
here i call on the commissioner to target fleets which impose unsustainable pressure on key stocks .
particular attention must be given to the needs of small , isolated coastal communities that rely exclusively on fish .
i agree with mrs pery when she says fishing communities throughout europe have little confidence in present policy .
in order to rebuild this trust , there has to be a complete crackdown on illegal fishing .
i am glad to say that the irish presidency intends to make this a priority in its forthcoming term .
simply setting minimum prices for imports or financial compensation schemes are not sufficient : further action is required .
i therefore welcome the rapporteur 's calls for the improved management of resources , stabilization of incomes , measures to compensate for income losses and the creation of ' sea leader ' programmes .
mr president , mrs p&eacute;ry 's report analyses the different factors in the long-term crisis afflicting the community fishing industry .
what message is the commission sending them ?
it is always the same : there is overfishing , and boats must be scrapped .
certainly , there is overfishing of some species .
certainly , there are catches of some fish which are too young .
certainly , it is the commission 's duty to sound the alarm .
but fishermen are not fools , commissioner .
they know very well that the survival of their profession depends on managing the resources responsibly .
it is simply that they are obliged to work more , to produce more , because the collapse of fish prices leaves them no alternative , if they wish to survive .
contrary to some simplistic ideas , the more the price of fish falls , the more our fishermen increase their catch tonnage in order to balance their books .
it is not just a question of scrapping vessels , but above all of breaking this vicious circle .
the crisis affecting the fishing industry is clearly a market crisis .
the role of the common organization of the market is , in particular , to regulate the conditions of competition between community producers and to prevent unfair competition from third countries .
however , prices are being undermined from outside as well as inside the community .
when will it be decided to impose the application of minimum prices - which only make sense if everyone plays by the same rules - on the producers ' organizations ?
i know that this seems to run counter to the sacred dogmas of economic liberalism .
the consumer is not being made king , but once again taken for a fool .
today , the commission is presenting its fourth fisheries guidance plan .
with the commendable aim of conserving resources , this plan provides for further drastic fleet reductions .
at any rate , i believe that the contribution of this debate is very valuable , particularly with a view to the report that is to be considered by the council .
it is in fact common ground that a problem exists , but there are times when the solutions proposed seem frankly to me to be impracticable or counter-productive .
i say that because i believe that some negative effects that we do not wish to see could also occur .
moving on to the measures to conserve resources , the commission endorses many of the principles expressed by the rapporteur .
but i would venture to say that , fundamentally , as far as financial assistance is concerned , what the report is basically proposing is more or less permanent compensation to anyone having to leave the profession .
and for that , apart from the other reasons , i thank the rapporteur .
turning now to the other two reports - on nafo and the antarctic .
in those terms , i consider this a positive aspect at least .
a third factor , however , on which i do not particularly agree , is that of the voting system in nafo .
i say this not just from a political point of view , because i believe that having a common fisheries policy means speaking with a single voice , otherwise it is not a common policy .
the final report is mr kofoed 's report .
that proposal is not submitted to the council by the commission until the 90 day period for raising possible objections has expired , that being the time-scale set down in the baltic convention .
i think then that i have explained the procedural issue and the simplification of procedure and have also entered into specific commitments on the provision of information , as far as the commission is concerned .
at this stage , allow me to mention three things : firstly , we have , clearly , a whole series of misunderstandings and , maybe , inadequate information .
i am sorry , for example , that ms malone is not here , but i have no idea where she read that the structure of the fleet is not taken into consideration .
that is not true , nor is it written down anywhere - quite the reverse .
as you know , there is a general proposal to reduce the mortality rate of certain stocks .
this is not a generalized reduction of 40 per cent of the european fleet - that is categorically not the case !
that more general decision will be attached to the 13 national plans which the commission will have to negotiate with the thirteen member states .
the objective of reducing the mortality rate by 40 per cent concerns some stocks whose plight the experts consider to be desperate .
on this occasion , we had two committees of experts : the usual group and the larsen group .
these are arrangements that we are setting in place with the fishermen . i would point out that , before we submitted pop iv , we held 38 regional conferences with the fisheries sector .
i repeat : thirty-eight .
that proposal did not then come out of the blue : it , along with various other issues , was discussed in 38 regional conferences .
but it may be said that that is not enough : of course , 50 is a larger number than 38 but there comes a point at which 38 seems to me in itself to represent a great effort .
certainly , it is difficult to set up ten committees of experts !
small-scale fisheries , which provide more jobs , are excluded from this programme .
therefore , small-scale fisheries , which provide more jobs , are not covered by the proposed reduction .
but clearly , ladies and gentlemen , we shall , if you wish , discuss all of this again on the 26th .
as far as the gallineta is concerned , i can inform the honourable member that that type of fish , which could be fished freely , has never been fished by the spanish fleet .
it began to fish scorpion fish - gallineta in spanish - in november and december of 1995 , no earlier .
if i have to propose a tac and a quota then i have to take into consideration a specific period and , as in the case of nafo , the chosen period is five years .
the honourable member will allow that a fleet that began fishing two months ago cannot have the same quota as a fleet from another member state that has been fishing that type of fish for years .
i therefore think that a degree of reasonableness would really help everyone to act a little more responsibly .
a final point , ladies and gentlemen : i do not enjoy proposing cuts in the fishing effort , that is plain ; i would rather be managing a sector in expansion .
it may be self-evident but that is how it is .
i urge you to believe that the proposed measures are the minimum needed to secure a future for that sector .
it will be for the governments to take a decision : unanimously they can also reject the commission proposal .
but they know that , in terms of democratic transparency , we have all to shoulder our own responsibility .
it is true that we must give the sector a sign of confidence , but ladies and gentlemen , we must be aware of the distinction between conveying confidence and conveying an illusion !
we all have a responsibility to say this , because we can all do at least one thing , both you and i and the fishermen : increase the number of fish .
that is just what we are not doing !
and if there are no fish , then there is no sector for an industry which is one of your concerns , ladies and gentlemen , but - believe me , is one of mine too !
i must thank the commissioner for the information she has given us but my question remains unanswered .
my question was : who gave the commission the information used as the basis for the proposal for a 40 % cut in portuguese sardine catches ?
i referred to a spanish minister , criticizing the fact that she accepted a 20 % reduction of the scorpion fish quota at the start of the negotiations .
i said that this was a clear mistake on the part of the minister in question , but i did not refer to the commissioner at all .
mr president , i would like to ask the commissioner if she would reply to the safety factor which is all-important .
safety should be the prime objective of the commission , parliament and the council .
there is a very serious situation in ireland .
if fishermen want to make their boats safer they are prevented from doing so because it is suggested by the irish authorities and by the commission that they are adding to the capacity .
this is totally untrue .
they are making them safer .
they are not increasing the capacity of the vessel .
they are not increasing the carrying capacity .
they may be increasing the tonnage but there is no relationship between one and the other and commissioner bonino should take this matter on board and try to ensure that the boats are safer .
we have an ageing fleet and this should be taken into consideration .
it is not a question of a mistake by our minister .
the fact is that for years , during the time of the socialist government , the spanish fleet asked the spanish ministry of agriculture and fisheries for permission to fish for scorpion fish in the nafo zone .
the former socialist minister repeatedly refused that request .
now , with the establishment of a tac and quotas based on historical rights , the problem is that unfortunately our fleet does not have historical rights in that fishery .
that is the problem , mrs izquierdo rojo . and it is not the fault of our minister , but of the former socialist government .
mr president , as usual , this debate on the fishing industry has aroused a great deal of interest .
please forgive me , but many questions were asked which i was unable to answer individually , although we shall be seeing each other again on 26 june .
i described the situation concerning sardines - notably in portuguese waters - in the house last year .
the problem is not a new one , therefore .
as for the question on safety , mgp iv in fact provides for the establishment of facilities to increase safety at sea , provided these are compatible with the need to conserve resources .
this must not lead to developments which conflict with the aims of revising fishing capacity .
it is therefore possible to achieve this goal , even under mgp iv .
i hope that this answers the question .
i shall not go over the national issues again , except to confirm that this is the first time that a tac for this type of fishery has been established .
i would add that after a long debate , the commission and the member states have shown themselves to be reasonable and understood perfectly well who had historic rights and who did not .
i have no wish to restart the debate , but i should simply like to clarify the commission 's proposal .
the debate is closed .
the vote on the four reports will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
practice of the profession of lawyer
firstly , why is a special directive for lawyers necessary , when respect for subsidiarity naturally remains a key principle ?
we asked them why , and i well remember our colleague jean-pierre cot questioning the chairman of the consultative committee of european bars .
thus the aptitude test for joining the bar of a country other than one 's own has frequently been used as an effective protectionist barrier .
the commission heeded this call .
it produced a proposal for a directive , which it submitted to parliament in march 1995 .
in the very difficult circumstances of which the house is aware , this draft directive provided us with an initial working document , on the basis of which we have tried to square the circle , as it were .
what does that mean ?
although , as i have said , the desire for this directive amongst the profession was almost unanimous , opinions on what the directive should contain were sharply divided .
some wished the aptitude test for joining the bar of a host country to be retained and the permanent practice of the profession under the home-country professional title to be authorized .
others , conversely , wished the aptitude test to be eliminated and the practice of the profession under the home-country professional title to be restricted to a certain length of time .
and we were guided , i would add , by a common political will to achieve a result .
i should like to tell you , ladies and gentlemen , that i appreciated this cooperation greatly .
we all knew that concessions had to be mutual and that , at the end of the day , no one could be entirely satisfied with the result .
i should also like to pay tribute to the very great political awareness of commissioner monti , who understood and accepted the necessary amendments that we proposed to him .
you accompanied us , mr monti , with a great deal of attention and political intelligence , down a road which was nevertheless full of pitfalls .
in my capacity as rapporteur , i thank you .
i sincerely believe that the compromise that we have adopted is well balanced .
integration into the host-country bar is facilitated by the elimination of the aptitude test .
however , the competent authority of the host member state will be able to verify that the lawyer in question has been practising seriously and effectively for the requisite amount of time .
in this context , i should be grateful if commissioner monti would clarify this important guarantee for us .
finally , provision has been made for joint practice , but we have taken care to protect lawyers from any danger of unfair takeovers by other professions .
because it is a matter of urgency for the european legal profession to organize itself in order to adapt to the inescapable reality of the globalization of world trade .
i would appeal to commissioner monti : we really did not take this matter lightly , and we have , i believe , achieved a very good result .
the legal profession needs this directive , and i hope that the commission will soon express an opinion on this matter and follow parliament 's proposals if at all possible .
things are moving at last in the european legal profession .
the internal market has given rise to a good deal of cross-border economic activity : the creation of companies , mergers , subsidiaries and partnerships .
in addition , people are engaging to a growing extent in cross-border activities which are not merely economic .
lawyers have seen themselves for too long as a part of their own national judicial system , and not as consultants whose services are also needed across borders .
without the persistence and the helpful suggestions of the ccbe on the proposal for a directive which is now under discussion , we would not have reached this stage .
in the mid-1970s , in its landmark judgment in the reyners case , the european court of justice ruled that legal practice was covered by the freedom to provide services and the freedom of establishment .
twenty years later , we are at last making this principle of primary community law a reality , at least in respect of the right of establishment .
this directive is a necessary one : firstly , it makes it clear that lawyers can establish themselves permanently in another member state and practise the law of the host country , under the home-country title .
this did need clarifying , because despite the court of justice ruling of 30 november 1995 in the gebhard case , doubt is still being cast on this right .
i would therefore draw attention to what is probably the most important sentence in that judgment : membership of a professional body cannot be regarded as a constitutive element of establishment .
secondly , the integration of lawyers wishing to join the bar of the host country is to be facilitated .
they will no longer be expected to sit an aptitude test under the directive on the recognition of qualifications , but will be able to prove their aptitude by practising the profession for three years .
this judgment obliges the member states to take account of the title acquired by the lawyer in the home country to practise the same profession .
should the knowledge and skills of the lawyer not correspond to the specific knowledge required in the host country , that country can demand that it be acquired differently , for example through practice .
this judgment therefore entitles lawyers to prove their ability by means of successful practice .
thus the vlassopoulou case forms the basis of the provisions for integration into the bar of the host country , as proposed by the committee on legal affairs and citizen 's rights .
the arrangement proposed by that committee , approved by a large majority of its members , is a fair and liberal one .
it is also courageous .
it demonstrates that european spirit which is so often lacking nowadays .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i really do believe that the directive being discussed today at first reading is a very important one .
lawyers have until now belonged to this category , since there have naturally been restrictions on the practice of the legal profession because of the differences between legal systems .
these provisions are long overdue , and represent a major step forward .
and that is no doubt why the vast majority of lawyers have expressed support for such a directive becoming european law in the near future .
within the legal profession , there has been some dispute about how , but not whether , to proceed .
it has therefore been the task of the committee , and tomorrow it will be that of the house , to resolve this dispute over the approach .
there were two main points at issue : firstly , whether or not to retain an aptitude test .
our view here was that in principle a test can be dispensed with , if a lawyer can provide evidence of sufficient practical experience in the country to which he moves .
the second point was the question of so-called compulsory integration .
here the commission originally proposed that after the expiry of a certain period of time , the lawyer must have an opportunity to decide either to become a full member of the local bar or to return home .
the committee decided to abandon this principle of compulsory integration , simply because it was our unanimous view that this is not in keeping with the principle of proportionality .
the committee proposes that the house should take a decision on this important point as well .
but it will no doubt do so over the next few days , or indeed at our sitting today or tomorrow .
all things considered , the ppe group supports this report in the amended form produced by the legal affairs committee .
the amendments represent a broad compromise between national interests , the interests of lawyers , and also between the different views of the political groups .
the debate is adjourned and will resume after the evening suspension .
the next item is question time .
question time ( commission )
the next item is question time to the commission ( b4-0566 / 96 ) .
question no 40 by mark killilea ( h-0435 / 96 )
subject : termination of the eu 's helios programme
will the commission confirm that the eu 's helios programme for the disabled is to wind up at the end of this year ?
can it confirm that the staff in the helios brussels office have already been told that they are to be let go by the end of the year ?
will it also confirm that it does not intend to renew the programme for a further 4 years , and that there is no comparable programme being put forward to replace it ?
given that there will be no successor helios programme for the foreseeable future , will the commission formally and extensively consult disability groups on what action they want for follow-up programme ?
why has there been no consultation on these proposals ?
disability is the first programme to be abandoned by the commission because of the problems with article 235 .
is this an indication that disability is a low priority with the commission ?
the commission has been active for many years in promoting better living and working conditions for people with disabilities .
as has been clearly indicated in its white paper on the future of social policy and its rolling social action plan , the commission is committed to a continued strengthening of the community 's contribution in this field .
already the potential of the structural funds in supporting people with disabilities has been enhanced .
in addition to the horizon employment initiative , significant resources are also targeted on people with disabilities through the mainstream structural fund programmes .
as far as helios is concerned , the council decision on 25 february 1993 establishing the helios ii programme provided that the programme was to be carried out in the period 1 january 1993 to 31 december 1996 .
consequently , the contracts with outside experts assisting the commission in implementing the programme will finish at the same time as the programme itself .
the final evaluation report on the implementation and results of helios ii will not be available until the middle of 1997 .
pending that evaluation it would be premature to propose any further programme of the helios type .
the commission recognizes that the european parliament , the ngos and , most importantly , disabled people themselves have high expectations of continuity of effort in this regard .
accordingly , a communication setting out the main lines of its strategy will be issued by the commission in the near future .
the commission intends to consolidate and further develop its links with these in a common endeavour to encourage the development of better policies and the implementation of better practices throughout the european community .
in this context the house may be assured that future strategy and any new initiatives will be discussed with the disability groups and , in particular , with the european disability forum .
i thank the commissioner for his reply .
i have a few points .
is it not rather odd that it takes until the end of the helios programme before an assessment is made ?
could it not have been made to coincide with the ending of the helios programme ?
i would make the following suggestion . it is fundamental in the allocation of structural funds or other major programmes that the amount of money available for the physically disabled should be identified .
i thank the honourable member for his interest in this matter .
i can assure him that it is a shared interest .
he will be aware that the programme runs out at the end of december .
the full evaluation will take place some months after that .
it was not possible of course to carry out the evaluation until the programme was finally completed .
i must tell mr killilea that we have an interim evaluation on the helios ii programme which was carried out by independent experts .
they highlighted a number of problems .
consequently , i think it is much better that we have a really dedicated programme on the next occasion so as to take full advantage of that evaluation and the further details in the final evaluation .
as regards finance , the helios ii programme was designed to co-finance the exchange of ideas simultaneously right across the union and so it nicely complements the european social fund which cofinances innovative action in the member states .
i am trying to get a better understanding between the cofinancing for the international networks and the co-financing at member state initiative level .
as you know , in the preliminary draft budget some ecu 6m has been allowed under heading b 34102 for 1997 .
that is a proposal for the preliminary draft budget .
it has been adopted by the commission as a whole but it does not commit the budgetary authority .
the budgetary competence for non-compulsory expenditure rests with parliament and it can take its own decision in that regard .
i am more confused now that i have heard the commissioner than i was before .
could he answer some simple questions .
is there going to be a comparable programme in the future ?
is disability a priority of the commission ?
will there be continuity from the helios ii programme ?
it sounds to me as if helios ii is going to come to an end , the commission is going to think about what it might do in the future and then it hopes the issue will disappear .
is there going to be continuity ?
is it a priority of the commission ?
will there be comparable programmes in the future ?
let there be no confusion on this matter .
the question of disability and what can be done to help people with disabilities is of the highest priority for the commission .
let that be clearly understood by everybody .
it is certainly our intention to have another programme .
there will be continuity of understanding and consultation with the people with disabilities themselves .
we do not want to go into the next programme until we have completed evaluation of the existing one .
that is why we are taking some time to consider what is the best way forward and to get the best synergy possible .
it is the highest priority and because it is the highest priority we are not just allowing a follow-on of what has been done heretofore because some uncertainties have been identified in the interim report .
i also wish to join in the thanks to the commissioner for his work in the area of disability and in particular to welcome his commitment to involve the ngos in the area , especially the european disability forum .
he mentioned that it is a priority within the commission .
i think everybody accepts that as true .
in his discussions with the italian presidency and the incoming irish presidency , has he had any commitments from them that it will also be a priority for the council ?
on the contrary , i have only heard very positive remarks at all times concerning what can be done .
the house knows very well the difficulty we have been having concerning some of the social programmes insofar as the use of article 235 is concerned .
it should be stated here that the council 's legal service has confirmed the principle of using article 235 to achieve treaty objectives where there is no specific legal base .
we might also note that the european parliament 's committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights made a similar recommendation when we talked about the programme for the elderly and that there was no other adequate legal alternative .
so i was perfectly satisfied that article 235 is quite sufficient and proper in these circumstances .
you can rest assured that everything will be done to promote this matter as effectively as possible under the irish presidency .
question no 41 by ivar virgin ( h-0412 / 96 )
subject : closure of nuclear power plants in the eu on safety grounds
have all nuclear reactors in the eu been fitted with pressure-reducing filter systems so that even major accidents do not pose risks to the public ?
do grounds exist for shutting down any reactor in the eu as a result of safety requirements not having been complied with ?
is there any safety-related evidence which is giving the commission cause to consider recommending that a reactor be shut down in any country ?
such measures are provided for at all the nuclear power plants in the community where there could be a risk of excess pressure within the shield .
the national nuclear safety authorities ensure that the safety standards in their countries are complied with .
all those member states with nuclear power plants also have qualified , independent nuclear safety authorities which issue operating licences and , if necessary , order plants to be shut down .
at present , the commission therefore has no plans to recommend the closure of any nuclear power plants in the community .
thank you for your answer .
as the question undeniably is of more than national significance i believe it would be reasonable for the commission to take an active interest in these issues .
i should therefore like to ask if the commission actively supports plans to make this kind of safety investment in other countries .
the commission therefore also supports the safety measures taken by the member states .
this means that in many areas , a common stance has been formalized to some extent on these important safety-related matters .
question no 42 by anita pollack ( h-0448 / 96 )
subject : potential trade war between italy and the usa
what is the commission doing about the usa threat to stop importing all fish products from italy by 28 july unless italy stops all illegal driftnetting ?
on 28 march 1996 , following a ruling by the united states court of international trade , the united states identified italy as a country engaged in large-scale driftnet fishing in international waters .
as a result sanctions may be introduced against italy .
the timing of us internal procedures allows 30 days from 28 march for consultations between the united states and italy , with a further 90 days to reach agreement .
in the absence of agreement the united states has 45 days in which to apply sanctions , which would take the timetable of the procedure to early september .
the community also stresses that such unilateral trade sanctions contravene the basic principles of the wto and the united states ' obligations within that organization .
the community reserves its rights under the wto should such trade sanctions be introduced by the united states .
i thank the commissioner for his fairly predictable reply .
i wonder if the commissioner would have come to parliament about this issue if we had not asked the question first ?
we have about us $ 1 billion worth of products involved here , including jewellery and perfume as well as fish products .
we really need to know what the implications are for multilateral trade agreements .
does the commission think it might be useful to try to persuade italy to stop using illegal drift-nets ?
while we have eu rules which limit drift-nets to a maximum of 2.5 kilometres in length , is the commission aware that the italian swordfish fleet uses nets as long as 20 kilometres ?
scientific studies show that less than 1 / 5 of the targeted species that are caught in the nets are actually used , while the rest of the catch is often thrown back dead .
so what is the commission going to do to persuade italy to put a stop to this very sorry state of affairs ?
the commission has started infringement procedures against italy as provided for under article 169 of the treaty .
the issue will soon be raised again with the italian authorities .
i hope that a satisfactory outcome can be achieved without delay .
if that is not the case , then the commission will proceed with the case to the court of justice in the normal way .
the position is that under united states ' legislation , if the matter is not resolved , the united states would and could introduce sanctions against marine products from the member state concerned , that is from italy .
i hope it will not arise because we also take the view that the action that has taken place is contrary to community law and it is for exactly that reason that we have started infringement procedures against italy .
question no 43 by wolfgang nu&szlig;baumer ( h-0446 / 96 )
subject : standards and regulations on certification
what is the commission 's assessment of the effect on competitiveness of the numerous and different standards and regulations on certification within the european union and what measures does the commission intend to take in this connection ?
how does the commission guarantee that a standard which does not meet the fundamental requirements provided for in directives , but which is referred to in the official journal , conforms to community provisions ?
mr president , standards are in the first instance private norms , in that they are drawn up by standardization organizations but do not generally have a binding effect .
they can of course become binding if the commission makes them mandatory and incorporates them into safety provisions , but that only happens in exceptional cases .
the existence of different private norms alongside one another is of course damaging , and that is why we set up the three standardization organizations cen , cenelec and etsi , whose workload has increased substantially .
at first , the formulation of these european standards , which replace a multitude of national standards , made a slow start .
after all , every standard requires technical preparation .
it is not too many , though , because these standards do replace a whole multitude of national standards . cooperation with national standardization bodies is also very good .
in principle , the standards drawn up by these organizations have no technical flaws , and this is ensured by the fact that they are checked by independent experts from outside these bodies .
however , should a standard exceptionally fail to meet the relevant basic requirements in full , it is withdrawn by the commission , once its shortcomings have been noted and after the appropriate consultation procedure has been followed .
thank you for your answer , commissioner .
i am always being told that many smes are deterred from patenting their inventions by major procedural and , above all , financial obstacles put in their way by the relevant authorities .
first of all , to my mind , one must distinguish between standards and patents .
it is of course very much to the advantage of small and medium-sized firms to apply standards , so as to offset to some extent the disadvantages which they suffer in calls for tender because of their size .
i believe that , as a result , more and more small firms will begin to apply standards .
patents are of course something quite different .
i do not know whether that was a slip of the tongue , because patents have nothing to do with standards .
naturally , a patent must be registered in accordance with certain procedures .
this is done either nationally or through the european patent office , which is increasingly taking over the work of the national patent offices .
the european parliament itself regards it as essential that such authorities and agencies should be funded out of their own revenue , and clearly this is a financial burden which we cannot reduce .
commissioner , to what extent does european standardization go hand in hand with international standardization , given the fact that over 40 % of european standards have already been recognized internationally ?
is it not our duty to respect not only the three standardization bodies in europe , but also the worldwide standardization network , for example in the telecommunications sector ?
the honourable member is absolutely right .
what you say is indeed logical , and ideally standards would be applicable internationally .
in many sectors , we already have a global market , and you rightly mention telecommunications .
together with the european standardization organizations , therefore , we are attempting to ensure that these standards apply worldwide .
in practice , there are two ways of doing this : the first is to participate in the work of the international standardization bodies which already exist .
the europeans carry out the bulk of this work .
secondly , there is a method which is very effective once a standard has already made an impact on the market .
the best example of this is gsm , the technical standard for mobile communications .
question no 44 has been withdrawn .
question no 45 by allan macartney ( h-0336 / 96 )
subject : commission policy and criteria with regard to the need for ngos to have expatriate presence in the countries where they work
many ngos work through local organizations in developing countries , in recognition and support of the experience and capacity that exists in those countries .
in the past , the commission has supported this approach and encouraged european development ngos to work with local counterparts .
in the fields of food aid , rehabilitation and longer-term development , the commission has on numerous occasions stressed the importance of civil society and private initiatives in developing countries .
what criteria do the commission apply in determining whether there is a need for european ngos to have an expatriate presence in a particular country ?
what are the advantages for the commission and for the ngo programmes of the use of expatriate european staff as opposed to staff of local organizations ?
does the commission agree that , in the light of its discussions on the linkages between emergency aid , rehabilitation and long-term development , there is added value in strengthening local organizations by working through them ?
the importance of this aspect was especially highlighted in the recent commission communication to the council and the european parliament on this very issue .
generally speaking , the commission bears in mind , as far as possible , the need to strengthen and implicate local partners in the execution of the various financial instruments .
against this background , as far as possible , ngos must resort to local staffing , as mentioned in the very conditions of co-funding for executing structural development projects .
it is obvious that this approach must be adapted according to the specific aims of the different budget rubrics and in situ conditions .
i do not know whether to be reassured or otherwise by the commissioner 's response .
he seemed to be saying all the right things .
the reason i ask that is because , after many years of decolonization , there is still an impression in some countries that the european union has not changed its basic mentality .
i hope i am wrong and perhaps he could confirm that i am wrong in that regard .
let me reassure you that you are right in your concerns but wrong in your subsequent conjectures .
the reason was that the administration was in a shambles and it really was not possible to carry out some essential projects if we did not contribute some expertise of our own .
but the principle is that unless there is a local partner - we always try to be the main force in the project - we simply do not finance the european ngos .
this is a very strong principle .
you will see that in the report we are presenting to the council and parliament at the beginning of next year that this is set out as one of our main objectives .
thank you for the question because it is an important one .
question no 46 by marianne eriksson ( h-0461 / 96 )
subject : development aid policy
an increasingly small proportion of eu aid goes to the world 's poorest countries , most of which are sub-saharan acp countries .
the eu 's insistence on giving priority to aid to eastern europe and the mediterranean region is being pursued at the expense of the very poorest countries .
what is the commission 's position on this problem ?
does it intend to endeavour to change this state of affairs and , if so , how ?
the authorizations granted in the framework of the european development fund have continuously increased .
under the vith fund the funding levels reached 7.5 billion ecu rising to 10.9 for the viith and 12.8 for the viiith .
in other words , the funding for the edf has gone up by almost 20 % .
the share of g overseas aid taken up by the fund has remained steady since 1991 , around 45 % of all community overseas aid .
this is important and especially so since of the 48 least developed countries identified by the un , 40 of them belong to the acp and are funded in terms of overseas aid by the european development fund .
as far as the union budget is concerned , the importance attributed to the acp countries and especially the poorest ones in the framework of aid and cooperation policies has likewise not gone down over recent years .
this share-out will remain in effect until 1999 and nothing suggests that it will be changed to the detriment of resources earmarked for the acp countries .
european union aid to the countries of central and eastern europe is indeed important and has steadily increased since 1990 .
resources for the mediterranean region will also increase substantially given our new euro-mediterranean partnership .
but i should like to emphasize that none of this has bene to the detriment of the acp countries .
when translated into local currencies - i.e. purchasing power on the ground - the increase is far greater than 50 % .
i should like to thank you for your answer .
what you said was not unexpected , i must admit .
one of the reasons i asked the question is that the swedish government has now decided to make cuts in aid in sweden , partly on account of the eu aid programme .
i have examined eu aid with this in mind .
i therefore believe that my question still requires an answer .
am i making a correct interpretation , does the commission share it and if so , how does the commission intend to work to improve things for the 20 poorest countries in the world today ?
the second aspect which i would like to underline is that the multilateral approach is not a substitute for some of the bilateral approaches .
the nordic countries especially have set an example of very good cooperation , especially in acp countries and through some of the best ngos we have working in the acp countries .
i therefore hope that sweden , as one of the main countries that has pursued that policy , will continue to do so in future .
a second aspect concerns the poorest countries .
the commission has decided that the funds provisionally earmarked for the next five years should allow for a greater increase for the poorest countries - the poorest of the poor .
therefore we established a system that means that of the poorest countries no-one will get less than a 25 % increase in their edf funding .
most probably they will receive 50 % more in the five years to come as regards the edf financial envelope .
why have we done this ?
among other reasons , because we have two tranches in edf spending .
in principle the poorest countries will be less able to absorb it and therefore it will be the better off that will get some extra money in the distribution of the second tranche .
in creating this imbalance in favour of the poorest countries at the beginning , we have tried to make sure that the overall balance is not destroyed at the end of the next edf .
nowadays not only the quantity of resources available is crucial but also the coordination .
it is a deliberate policy which is already paying off .
question no 47 by graham watson ( h-0317 / 96 )
subject : microsoft monopoly
is the commission aware that microsoft is exploiting its monopolistic position in the computer software market to the detriment of european suppliers and users ?
having secured around 80 % of the market in this sort of software , microsoft enjoys an unrivalled domination in the sector .
high levels of demand for the microsoft office , which includes word wordprocessor and excel spreadsheet , amongst consumers limits uk , and hence european , suppliers ' competitive ability and diverts business to the us .
what action does the commission intend to take to end such a blatant example of predatory pricing which clearly breaches the spirit of gatt negotiations ?
the commission shares the honourable member 's concern about the behaviour of dominant firms and we are particularly concerned where abusive behaviour by a dominant firm may be impairing the ability of its european customers to compete .
the extent to which microsoft , which appears to be a dominant supplier , can charge different prices to different customers and other aspects of their licence contracts with computer manufacturers are currently being discussed with microsoft 's management .
i am grateful for that information from the commissioner that this is being discussed because this strikes me as a blatant example of predatory pricing which clearly breaches the spirit of the gatt negotiations .
indeed it is possible that this is not the only case of predatory pricing by this particular company .
i do not believe that there is any way in which we can prevent what is a very good product being the standard for office software in europe .
all attempts to promote alternatives to it from europe will probably be a waste of money because it is a very good product and very successful with consumers .
but pressure , adverse publicity and perhaps financial penalties for predatory pricing are more likely to be successful .
any assurance that you can give the house that action could be taken if this is discovered to be true would be gratefully received .
as i said , we are discussing this with the management of microsoft .
before coming to conclusions one must be very much aware of the fact that first of all , the pricing information we have is of a confidential nature .
but on the other hand , we have already seen a range of licence fees .
they are very different .
it is not appropriate to jump to a conclusion now .
i must be aware of very different situations which need to be looked into more closely .
on the other hand one should not forget , again before jumping to conclusions , that there are different fees for different services .
comparing only two amounts if not good enough .
i want to stress that point .
therefore please accept that i cannot be more specific today .
but i confirm that the commission is discussing this with the necessary confidentiality and with determination to find out what is really happening .
question no 48 by pat gallagher ( h-0390 / 96 )
subject : tendering procedures for mobile phone licences
that led to the approval in advance of the selection process by the commission ' ?
to understand the involvement of the commission in the irish tender procedure , it is necessary to recall that the commission opened a formal proceeding regarding the maintenance of the gsm monopoly in ireland in may 1994 .
on 8 march 1995 minister lowry confirmed that all the preparatory work for the opening up of the gsm market to competition was completed .
by letter of 27 april 1995 the commission had to draw the attention of the minister to certain conditions of the call for tender which could appear to be discriminatory .
the main issue was the amount the applicants were invited to pay for the right to the licence under clause 19 .
it was explained that such an option resulting in a fee which is only imposed on the second operator can significantly distort competition and favour the extension of the current dominant position of the incumbent telecommunications organization .
subsequent to this letter , the representatives of the irish government during a bilateral meeting held in brussels suggested to cap the initial payment and to impose a similar payment on telecom eireann .
the role of the commission is not to choose a given approach but to ensure that the approach chosen is in conformity with the rules of the treaty .
during these bilateral talks , the bidding procedure was suspended until the official confirmation of the commission on 14 july 1995 .
after that date the commission was not involved in any of the subsequent stages of the selection process .
the commission was not consulted on the letters of june and 5 july 1995 mentioned in the honourable member 's question .
i thank the commissioner for his detailed reply .
i would say to him that there is concern in ireland over the allocation of the second mobile phone licence .
this is a key element in our telecommunications strategy .
i should like to ask the commissioner if it is customary for the commission to become involved in the capping of fees as was the impression given by the irish authorities .
this evening 's reply is important in the light of the political and media speculation in ireland over the last few months .
could he confirm if the commission could be involved in any way in the delay in expediting the process ?
well , first of all let me recall that it is our policy to try to convince the governments not to impose a fee for a new operator .
but that is the second-best choice because , at the end of the day , the consumer has to pay the bill .
again , if the government chooses another approach , then it should be an even-handed one .
in the light of our remarks , the irish government was willing to cap the fee .
question no 49 by anne van lancker ( h-0392 / 96 )
subject : implementation of the guidelines on aid to employment
on 12 december 1995 the official journal published the guidelines on aid to employment .
these guidelines provide for a number of derogations from the rules of competition and the rules relating to state aid to firms for the benefit of certain groups of workers and unemployed persons who are difficult to place .
can the commission say to what extent member states ( and regions ) have been availing themselves of these opportunities and announced or taken measures to support employment for specific categories of workers ?
which member states have done so ?
do firms in the social economy sector ( such as those described in the commission 's communication on local initiatives ) and sheltered workshops qualify ?
is the commission considering an initiative aimed at encouraging the various authorities to take advantage of these measures ?
there are , of course , a number of practices and instruments in use .
there is no reason why they should not go ahead .
the commission has no choice but to oppose these .
for the rest , you know how seriously the commission takes the problem of unemployment , you are familiar with the white paper , you know about the initiatives which president santer and the commission have proposed .
my thanks to the commissioner for his detailed reply .
it clearly proves that social principles can still be observed even when competition rules are applied , and i am very pleased to see it .
i think far too few people realize that this is possible .
i do not wish to give a specific answer on this , because i feel that it is something that should be dealt with by the commissioner responsible for the internal market .
but where the measures affect competition and have a cross-border impact , then we naturally have to impose certain limits .
we try to interpret the concept of permitted state aid for employment as broadly as possible , provided that the governments or authorities are not trying to use this to gain an unfair advantage over one another .
question no 50 by j&ouml;rn svensson ( h-0460 / 96 )
subject : competition rules
a company called danisco has a monopoly over the sugar market in scandinavia .
it has decided to close down a profitable sugar refinery on the swedish island of gotland and is putting obstacles in the way of someone who is interested in taking over the refinery .
current legislation does not prevent such tactics .
does the commission intend to take steps to tighten up the rules of competition so that such situations cannot arise ?
this is happening every day .
but in this specific case we have not been received any specific complaint or any information .
therefore , i cannot be more specific .
mr president , thank you commissioner for your answer , even though it was by its nature rather vague .
we shall perhaps return to this question and i will then try to produce more concrete information on the case as such .
what we are talking about is in the first instance to all intents and purposes a monopoly ; no sugar is sold in sweden that does not come from this particular company .
i consider that this in itself is a situation which should call for steps to be taken .
secondly , this company is preventing the establishment of an alternative on the island of gotland , which is important from the point of view of regional policy and where the sugar industry plays a major role .
a small follow-up question : what attitude would the commission adopt towards stricter swedish legislation to prevent monopolistic behaviour in the sugar industry of the kind we are seeing today ?
since sweden has only recently become a member of the european union , some of the problems which might arise and monopoly situations which are there have to be tolerated for the time being .
in this respect i would ask national competition authorities if necessary to perform their own function .
but if it is a question of a dominant company or monopoly abusing its position then that must be established .
you must have evidence to show that .
that is why we have competition rules and a competition authority which , as you know , is the commission .
as long as we do not have a complaint and as long as there is no evidence , the honourable member will understand that the commission has no reason to act .
question no 51 by mikko r&ouml;nnholm ( h-0493 / 96 )
subject : business concentrations in finland
finland is in a strange position at present as regards competition policy : banking and insurance activities and the retail trade have been concentrated in the 1990s into ever fewer hands .
in 1991 the market share of the two largest banks taken together was 55 % , whereas in 1995 it was almost 80 % .
the corresponding figures for the retail trade were some 60 % in 1985 and nearly 90 % in 1995 .
the emergence of business concentrations particularly since finland 's membership of the eu is causing surprise among finns , because it results in rising costs and a falling level of services .
it is not surprising that when countries join a big single market such as the one we have there is also a movement of concentration , mergers and acquisition .
this is part of the game and is happening every day everywhere in europe .
obviously , and fortunately i would say , there are rules of the game .
we have had the merger regulation since 1989 .
in the most important cases the commission has the exclusive right to vet the mergers and the acquisitions .
by the way , since 1988 we have had to vet more than 400 cases of big mergers and acquisitions .
everyone would agree that it has been a rather successful policy and in several cases we had to impose conditions on such mergers and acquisitions .
in finland there was the merger between kymmene and repola .
we imposed some conditions on that .
in some other cases the commission went as far as giving a red light and did not allow a merger or acquisition to go ahead .
that is the rule of the game .
the basic rule is that acquiring a dominant position by merger or by acquisition is not allowed .
this is a real guarantee against too big mergers and certainly against the creation of dominant positions by means of mergers and acquisitions .
but if it is abusing that position , the commission can act and possibly impose heavy fines and this occasionally has been done .
we have rules and if there are cases which the commission should know about or where competitors think they have a case , they should file complaints with the commission .
not that i am asking for extra work .
last year there was an increase of one-third in the number of cases , more than 30 % of the number of cases in the competition field , and this was only partly because of enlargement .
let me just say one thing .
we would like to reduce that threshold to ecu 2 bn , which would already give more scope for the commission to look into that kind of merger .
this might well apply in the case of finland .
there is the so-called dutch clause - article 22 of the merger regulation - which allows national authorities to take a case before the commission even if the figure does not reach the threshold .
so the government can send a case to us and the commission will scrutinize it and if appropriate take a decision .
so it is already possible for a national government to take that step .
although this clause is rarely used , it could well be used very soon in finland , if i am well informed .
i cannot be more specific but as far as i know the finnish authorities are rather in favour of that kind of cooperation .
question no 56 by felipe camis&oacute;n asensio ( h-0422 / 96 )
subject : tobacco farming in the eu
what prospects does the commissioner for agriculture envisage for tobacco farming in the eu in general and in spain in particular ?
the reform of the tobacco sector , carried out in 1992 , will be reviewed at the same time .
this review is not yet complete , and i therefore regret that at present , i am unable to make any detailed comments .
with regard to spain , however , i would make the point that , as in other less-favoured regions of the european union , tobacco growing represents practically the only source of income for many small farmers there .
your answer was not a very specific one , commissioner .
however , i am grateful for the information you have given us concerning tobacco farming in the european union in general , and in spain in particular .
this consideration must be taken into account , i believe , in the proposals for 1998 , to which the commissioner has just referred .
i am well aware how important tobacco growing is for many small farmers in the european union .
according to our estimates , some 400 000 jobs throughout the union depend on it .
question no 57 by ulf holm ( h-0428 / 96 )
subject : subsidies to tobacco growers
about ecu 1 billion is paid to tobacco growers in the union every year , whilst the smoking of tobacco causes diseases and human suffering .
the provision of medical care for smokers costs vast amounts of money every year in the member states .
eu and national health programmes are aimed at reducing smoking as a way of combating cancer and other diseases .
does the commission intend to cut aid to tobacco growers in future , in order to achieve consistency with its health-related objectives ?
does it intend to introduce measures to help tobacco growers switch over to growing other products which satisfy more basic human needs ?
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the question is now being put the other way round , as it were .
the questioner asserts that aid for tobacco growing leads to an increase in smoking , thereby compounding the health risks .
people would be unlikely to smoke either more or less .
thank you for your answer , mr fischler .
this is the answer i was really after in that the question you answered earlier mentioned that a great many small farmers continue to cultivate tobacco .
how does the commission intend to deal with this problem and find a new crop for these small farmers to grow ?
i would repeat that even if we were to give these small farmers an opportunity to grow different crops , that is no reason to expect people in europe to smoke less .
the two things are completely separate , and must be kept apart .
in any event , i think it would be premature to hold a detailed discussion today .
some members of the house - including the last questioner - have drawn attention to the importance of retaining this aid and preserving jobs in tobacco growing .
we shall be able to discuss this with one another .
when i last looked at this issue , i discovered that 80 % of the value of the product is in fact community subsidy to tobacco growers - 80 % - and that is not very helpful .
the annual payment that some of the tobacco growers get is , in fact , more than the value of the land that tobacco is grown on .
so , again , there is a huge inconsistency in what the commission is trying to achieve .
i tend to agree with alternative production , but some of these growers are very small growers indeed .
therefore , commissioner , i would like to suggest to you that what we should do to try and get consistency in community expenditure is , in fact , to decouple the payment from the product .
as to whether aid to tobacco growers is currently being provided in the best possible way , that is open to discussion , and will likewise be addressed in my report .
i therefore do not wish to embark on a full discussion here and now .
surely we should not be subsidizing very rich countries to produce what you have just said is a very unprofitable crop when there is absolutely no economic reason for doing so ?
we should do away with that completely and help , through structural funds , those countries where there is a real economic problem and help them to develop alternative crops .
unfortunately , because of the structures which exist - even in the country with the best structures in the european union , namely the united kingdom - some farmers are experiencing real income problems .
it cannot , i am afraid , be inferred from the fact there are many wealthy farmers in the uk that those who do have problems there deserve no support .
we cannot discuss the matter on this basis .
question no 58 by gerard collins ( h-0427 / 96 )
subject : emergency aid for nyre valley sheep farmers
will the commission now bring forward proposals to aid the many farmers who have had to endure large scale losses as a result of the abnormal weather conditions ?
mr president , the commission is aware of the difficulties referred to in the question , which were caused by this snow storm and the freak weather conditions in the nyre valley in ireland .
however , i can tell you that the irish authorities have not sought assistance from the commission .
as the author is not present question no 59 lapses .
question no 60 by christine crawley ( h-0453 / 96 )
the commission has no precise statistics on how many jobs have been lost , or are at risk , in the processing industry , in slaughterhouses or in the cattle trade , as a result of the bse crisis .
we do not possess such information .
it goes without saying , however , that the commission is well aware of the problems and has begun to consider how they can best be minimized .
one of the most important short-term measures which we have taken in this context is of course intervention .
over and above that , to my mind , it is chiefly a matter of seeking to adopt longer-term confidence-building measures to boost the consumption of beef .
here the commission is of course trying to help find solutions to overcome these serious difficulties and to restore consumer confidence .
the same applies to the measures , still to be agreed , which are intended to accelerate the eradication of the bse disease .
i believe that all these measures , taken together , do provide some relief in these difficult circumstances .
i thank the commissioner for his answer .
so i believe that it is important for the commission to take this very seriously .
i would ask what steps the commission intends to take to ask for figures from the member states on the threat to jobs and jobs that have already disappeared because of the bse crisis ?
other initiatives can also be taken under the objective 3 and objective 4 measures ; these offer very specific support .
with statistics alone , we cannot help anyone .
however , if you think it important to have precise figures on the employment situation in this sector , i shall gladly pass the matter on to my colleague mr flynn , who is the commissioner responsible .
we could perhaps carry out a detailed survey , or else obtain information from the uk authorities .
mrs crawley 's question was about people in associated industries , the people who lost their jobs as a result of the ban , who work in the road haulage industry , the slaughterhouses , the meat-processing industry .
i asked the scottish office if there are any programmes we can use to help , for example objective 5 ( a ) or objective 5 ( b ) .
the earl of lindsay tells me that there are quite insurmountable obstacles in using ec structural funds .
there are detailed legal obligations which cover these measures and it is not possible to set aside these provisions .
but objective 5 ( a ) concerns grants for marketing and processing of agricultural products .
if people are prevented from marketing or processing agricultural products , could we not use objective 5 ( a ) funds to assist them with this particular problem that we have at the moment ?
i think we actually need to look at the scale of what is involved here .
if you think that intervention costs are lower , i would point out that across the eu , the total amount in intervention has reached 150 000 tonnes .
the cost of intervention for 100 000 tonnes is ecu 240 million .
this means that we have already spent ecu 360 m on these measures alone , to enable the animals to be slaughtered immediately , because ultimately this boosts employment in slaughterhouses .
if they are then stored in refrigerated warehouses , people are employed there too , and so on .
i therefore believe that these large-scale measures are in fact the most important contribution in terms of employment .
moreover , i would draw your attention to the fact that the volume of turnover is significantly greater in the united kingdom than in many other member states .
although prices to farmers are low , the turnover of slaughterhouses is higher than in other member states .
the question of employment can certainly not be seen merely in the uk context .
i should like to come back to objective 5 ( a ) and particularly budget line 886 .
i understand that from the period from 1994 to 1999 , ecu 226.487 million were available to the uk to use for marketing and processing .
in fact i understand that the uk government is only wanting ecu 51 million of that , therefore not taking up ecu 175.304 million .
for me that is a massive dimension of funding which could very well be invested in the uk economy to help those people in the industry .
the figures which you have given tally exactly with my own figures .
it goes without saying that the commission is prepared to take decisions on measures under any directive , but we do need a request from the government responsible .
as you will see from the footnote , the commission has asked if we could take question no 94 from mrs crepaz on basic foodstuffs - consumer protection .
question no 94 by irene crepaz ( h-0465 / 96 / rev .
1 )
subject : basic foodstuffs - consumer protection
which final products are directly or indirectly affected by the lifting of the ban on gelatine , tallow and bull semen ?
what measures have been taken to inform and protect consumers ( certificates , labelling , information campaigns ) ?
what is the commission 's attitude to the statement made in the context of the bse crisis that producers of basic foodstuffs should take responsibility for these ?
under the decision , the raw material used to manufacture these products must originate from cattle under 30 months old that are not infected with bse or suspected of infection .
in addition , only tissue from types of raw material in which the virus has never been detected may be used .
the products listed in the annex must be labelled , or otherwise marked , with details of the manufacturer and the manufacturing process , and must bear a certificate of fitness for consumption issued by a veterinary official .
the composition of the final products is visible to the consumer from the list of ingredients , which must appear on the label pursuant to directive 79 / 112 on the labelling of foodstuffs .
the commission will consider the question of extending the rules on product liability to primary producers in the context of its current work on preparing a green paper on food legislation .
thank you for your comprehensive reply , commissioner .
can you assure me , with a clear conscience , that these do not contain any pathogens , and that they represent absolutely no health risk to consumers ?
and with regard to bull semen , can you state with a clear conscience that no disease can be transmitted through it ?
secondly , we have stipulated that every manufacturer of gelatine and tallow in the united kingdom must obtain a licence from the british government .
thirdly , we have ensured that only certain specific products may be used to manufacture gelatine and tallow , namely those which i have already described .
only such tissue may be used .
fourth , the british government is obliged to inform the commission as soon as it awards a licence to an industrial company .
no one can say at present when exports of gelatine will in fact be resumed .
question no 61 by roy perry ( h-0474 / 96 )
subject : bse
bse has only recently become a notifiable disease , and it is evident that this disease has not been as closely monitored in other member states in comparison with the united kingdom .
mr president , according to the latest information , the most likely cause of the bse epidemic is the feeding of cattle with meat and bone meal derived from processed materials containing sheep carcasses affected by scrapie .
the unusually high incidence of bse in the united kingdom , compared with the other member states , can be attributed to various factors .
bse became a notifiable disease throughout the community under decision 90 / 130 / eec , in the context of council directive 89 / 894 .
the commission has arranged training courses for national experts on issues relating to the detection of bse , so as to ensure that all the member states are adequately equipped to diagnose it .
only this weekend there are reports from scientists in such places as the dutch institute of science and health and t&uuml;bingen university , which throw grave doubts on the figures coming from other european countries .
between 1985 and 1989 57 , 000 cattle from the united kingdom were exported to countries in the european union .
had they remained in britain those scientists would have expected something like 1 , 600 cases of bse to be declared .
in reality only 30 cases have been declared and i repeat the question : does the commission have any system at all for monitoring and validating the statistics that are coming from these other countries ?
has he any comments on these reports now coming from european scientific foundations ?
this disease is notifiable in all countries , and we can therefore assume that the member states are fulfilling their responsibilities in this respect .
that is why i have asked the so-called weissmann group to propose some research projects , so that such tests might become a reality as soon as possible .
that would considerably facilitate the handling of this disease .
that concludes question time .
questions not taken for lack of time will be answered in writing .
( the sitting was suspended at 7.27 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
practice of the profession of lawyer ( continuation )
there is no reason why these two objectives should conflict , but nor are they are necessarily complementary , as this draft directive makes clear .
certainly , it is not all negative .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i should firstly like to congratulate mrs fontaine on her clear and effective treatment of this second version of the proposal for a ' lawyers ' directive .
the painful birth of the ' pharmacists ' and ' dentists ' directives , which took 16 and 17 years respectively to adopt , provided an example to avoid .
we support the replacement of the aptitude test with a fair and equitable procedure for assessing the professional competence of migrant lawyers .
we welcome the consensus achieved with a view to protecting lawyers ' interests in the case of the establishment of multi-disciplinary practices .
on the other hand , perhaps - and i stress perhaps - the provision enabling migrant lawyers to practise under the home-country professional title for an unlimited period of time ought to be questioned .
and perhaps the committee 's recognition of a hybrid status of established free service provider should be questioned too .
mrs fontaine 's report concerns the interests of the legal profession as a whole .
it deals in particular with the question of the right of migrant lawyers to practise their profession permanently under their home-country professional title in another member state .
like many lawyers in france and other member states , we have reservations as regards the possibility of practising permanently under the home-country professional title , without any limit of time .
and like the french bar , we are opposed to the absence of genuine controls and restrictions on the activities of migrant lawyers in host member states .
we also wish to protect the interests of citizens subject to the law , and we are calling for genuine and de facto equal treatment of lawyers registered in france , for example , and migrant lawyers .
in particular , fiscal and public service constraints must not be a burden on host-country lawyers alone .
the french bar expressed its opposition to the first draft of this report , which it considered to be prejudicial to the profession .
mrs fontaine and her colleagues in the legal affairs committee have finally drawn up a compromise text .
it is for this reason that we are reserving our position on the report and the draft directive .
the profession , as represented by the consultative committee of the bars and law societies of the european community , worked hard on this project for a number of years .
i should like to make two comments concerning this text . firstly , the debate has understandably centred on the remaining obstacles : aptitude tests , and the right to practise under the home-country professional title .
however , this should not lead us to forget the other important provisions of the text .
my second comment concerns the particular question of the right to practise under the home-country professional title , an issue on which , as was pointed out a few moments ago , the french bar is especially sensitive .
i believe that the proposed text gives the necessary assurances .
it clearly makes migrant lawyers practising under their home-country title subject to the regulations , codes of conduct and disciplines of the bars of host member states .
lastly , amendment no 35 , which provides a useful clarification of the integration mechanism that is being established , will meet the expectations expressed by a number of bars , including in particular the paris bar .
it now remains for the council to put the finishing touches to the text , with the help of mr monti .
is it being overoptimistic to hope that it will do so quickly ?
mr president , the proposal for a directive which we are discussing today is undoubtedly one of those measures which , to paraphrase robert schuman , strengthen the building of europe .
for let no one doubt the fact : european integration must be based on the rule of law .
europe will be a community of law , or it will be nothing .
it should not be forgotten that what prevents him from taking part in these cases is the responsibility imposed by his professional code of conduct not to participate without sufficient technical knowledge .
i am coming to the end , mr president .
i referred to the social function of lawyers .
the legal profession is faced with the exciting challenge of combining the inevitably commercial aspects of the practice of the law with its social function .
because its ultimate raison d ' &ecirc;tre , beyond any other consideration , is to defend our citizens , our fundamental rights and public freedoms , and the spiritual heritage which constitutes the foundations of european civilization .
clearly , the creation of an area of freedom and security is everyone 's joint task . but lawyers will play a particularly important role in this respect .
mr president , following a virtually unanimous request put forward by lawyers , the commission has presented a proposal for a directive , which we are now discussing .
i consider this free movement to include not only the free movement of practising lawyers , but also the actual freedom to offer one 's services .
the commission has however chosen to give a special sectoral directive and to maintain the principle on a restrictive aptitude test .
today the committee on legal affairs is proposing 27 amendments , by which fundamental changes are made to the commission 's proposal .
the purpose of these amendments is to increase the opportunities for a lawyer of one member state to establish himself in another member state .
the committee proposes that it would be possible to practise the profession of lawyer in all member states provided that the lawyer permanently uses the professional title from his own country .
the group that i represent is not certain whether the proposal put forward by the committee on legal affairs in principle is consistent and logical .
may i ask the commission to give its view in detail on the amendments put forward by the committee on legal affairs and the group that i represent .
finally i would like to congratulate mrs fontaine on an excellent report .
mr president , i should like to begin by congratulating mrs fontaine on her excellent report , on which there are a number of comments i wish to make .
with this report , we are at something of a crossroads .
the legal professions , of which lawyers are one of several - business trustees , notaries and the like - are of course based on their national legal systems .
in recent years , however , there has been a growing need within the european union for these professions - to which i myself belong - to look beyond national borders .
this has obviously made it necessary to get to grips with other legal systems .
i am not in favour of compartmentalizing this profession by erecting an artificial barrier to access , and the report says the same thing .
on the other hand , the legal safety of the citizens in our countries is at stake .
the functions of lawyers should not , in my opinion , be seen in narrow terms , but they should also be regarded as business advisers .
in the future , it will certainly be necessary to do this .
if these directives and the debate on them open up such a prospect , then the report is a good starting-point for a very fruitful discussion .
mr president , i would like to thank mrs fontaine and colleagues on the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights for their considered and intelligent discussion of this topic .
this is an important plank in the freedom to establish services and the completion of the single market .
it gives room for recognition of the fact that lawyers can practice under home title in other countries .
it is particularly important for lawyers in england and wales as english law is an international commercial law .
i would like to flag up one linguistic problem .
amendments nos 25 and 35 should state ' public interest ' and not ' public order ' as has been translated .
in conclusion , this is the usual understated , erudite competence which we expect and usually find from mrs fontaine .
of much greater importance , in my view , is the quality of the compromise , and in that regard mrs nicole fontaine deserves all our congratulations .
because this compromise , as set out in her report , leads in the right direction .
it gives real meaning to freedom of establishment .
it constitutes an advance for the union and for europe .
so i think that we should all accept that mrs fontaine 's compromise is a good step forward .
on such a subject it is only natural that many people should have had reservations and objections .
we in greece , too , have had a lot of difficulties .
just as an example , i can mention the problem of the establishment of law firms in greece via a particular method and with elements that are not applicable in other european countries .
of course , we all had to surmount those problems rather than persist with reservations which would have worked against the solutions put forward today by mrs fontaine .
mr president , firstly , i should like to congratulate the rapporteur , mrs fontaine , on this report on the proposal for a directive on the practice of the profession of lawyer .
i believe that ensuring the freedom to practise the profession of lawyer throughout the european union represents a further step towards achieving the political integration of the union and guaranteeing the democratic rights of all its citizens .
the current problems may well be simply the kind of temporary difficulties which are characteristic of an adaptation period - a period which will pave the way for the proper functioning of the system in the future .
furthermore , i welcome amendment no 7 to article 1 , which provides for the establishment of the professional title ' lawyer ' in all the official languages of the spanish state .
the luxembourg bar currently has 620 lawyers , 27 % of whom are non-nationals .
this is clearly proof that the free movement of lawyers is a reality in luxembourg .
mr president , i too extend my congratulations to the rapporteur , especially for the compromise text that she has produced , with which i find myself overwhelmingly in agreement .
i would like your assurance that tonight the services will take this on board and that article 10 ( 3 ) will now read ' public interest ' , and not ' public order ' .
this problem has already been dealt with by the relevant services .
guided by the community-spirited principle of mutual trust between the member states , mrs fontaine , you have drawn up a very far-reaching proposal .
through your exemplary work , you have managed to align the position of the european parliament with that of lawyers in many areas .
the amendments to articles 2 and 5 of the commission proposal , on the practice of the profession and home titles , address comprehensively what is a pressing concern of lawyers .
however , the crux of this directive is the provision in article 10 which eases the existing requirement of an aptitude test .
i suggest taking up the proposal of the ccbe that an interview , rather than an examination as such , should be held .
that would , i believe , be a thoroughly fair compromise , which would in particular suit the smaller member states .
i also applaud the work of the committee on legal affairs and citizens rights ' which has achieved a balanced position on the crux of the problem , succeeding in reducing to 27 the 94 amendments that were tabled .
i am grateful also for the kind words addressed to the commission .
to avoid any misunderstanding , i therefore welcome the opportunity to do as mrs fontaine has requested and provide some clarification concerning professional or ethical codes .
observance by lawyers practising under their home-country title of the professional and ethical code of the host member state is a fundamental element in the proposal for a directive .
these rules include , among others , those relating to the interdisciplinary aspect , to incompatibility and incapacity that are designed to guarantee the independence of the profession of lawyer .
those rules must be applied in compliance with the provisions of the treaty , the case-law of the court of justice in that field and this directive .
i shall conclude with two very brief points , mr president : as the commissioner with responsibility for the single market , i look upon the progress of this directive not only favourably but enthusiastically .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow , wednesday , at 12 noon .
satellite personal communications services
the plan was for a network of satellites to monitor the entire planet in real time in order to detect enemy missiles and knock them off course , possibly using lasers .
although the project is more than likely to be mothballed indefinitely , it had a spin-off in terms of research - initially subsidized research - into satellite technologies .
that is why america is now the leader in the field .
the main practical uses of these satellites are in telecommunications and broadcasting , services that we use very intensively .
for that reason , development work began on new technologies using satellites at lower orbits .
i believe there has been a lack of awareness among europeans in recent years as regards the development and use of these new technologies .
the leaders in the field are american companies which are able to obtain licences in america but then seek to operate throughout the world .
in europe , we have failed to give european companies a stake in this area of development .
we are merely passengers in these sectors , trying to hitch a ride without knowing exactly where we want to go or who is in the driving seat .
no matter how many white papers on employment we produce , we shall never make up for any missed opportunities in this field .
the commission has responded in the right way by stating that it has a responsibility to spur the member states of the european union into action .
we must keep reminding them that this particular area of satellite technology is one in which new markets will develop .
the commission has done a good job in this respect .
this means that terrestrial frequencies may face new competition in a form over which europeans no longer have any influence .
a considerable number of launchers will also be needed to put 844 satellites into orbit .
that will cost money and that is added value - and we may miss out on our share of it .
in this proposal , the commission has asked to be involved in issuing licences and in international negotiations with third countries .
here in parliament , therefore , we have proposed that in the event of a failure to agree on frequency allocation , or in international negotiations on the issue , the commission should be given a mandate .
i hope that the council will recognize the pragmatic nature of what we are asking for , and will not interpret it as weakness on the part of parliament .
i am sure that the commission will assert its rights in negotiations with the council , so that a sensible outcome can be achieved for european companies .
what they were up to there is not clear .
we must be vigilant in this area , and i am sure that the commission too will continue to take a lively interest in it .
there is an important difference between satellite telephone services and multimedia services via satellite .
in the case of the former , the reference is to mobile terminals whose main purpose is planet-roaming , the possibility then of travelling all around the world with just one telephone terminal .
the technology is there , the international consortia have been set up - and european industries are also involved in them - and the pilot projects are ready to get under way .
furthermore , the content of the services and the actual operators have yet to be clearly identified .
that being so , i have suggested that a clearer distinction be made in the commission proposal for a decision between the approach to the former and the latter .
moreover , the fact that there are several operators means that competition is secured .
i agree with the rapporteur , however , on the need to harmonize the procedures for the award of licences , but i do not think that the role of the commission can extend beyond that segment .
i have spoken on other occasions in the house - and commissioner bangemann will remember this - in favour of a ' european federal communication commission ' .
i am therefore in favour of the european union having a regulatory function but i do not believe that this dossier justifies the commission being given responsibility for selection .
through amendment no 11 , however , i am suggesting that we increase research into , the promotion and regulation of multimedia satellite services , the other category in fact .
it is in that sector that the future of the information society is being played out and it will be important that europe is not caught unprepared .
to conclude : there has been substantial agreement with the views of the committee on economic and monetary affairs and industrial policy and the rapporteur , mr hoppenstedt , whom i congratulate on an excellent piece of work .
in fact , a network of satellites covering the whole planet in real time already exists .
it is the bastard offspring - so to speak - of president reagan 's ' star wars ' project .
substantial investment will be necessary to achieve this goal , and this opens up some interesting prospects for the european space industry .
furthermore , it should not be forgotten that this project also covers fields other than telephony , notably multimedia communication .
a project of this importance undoubtedly requires a coordinated approach at international , and especially european level .
and it is in this context that the commission is envisaging the adoption of a single community procedure for selecting operators and granting licences to them .
besides the problem of the member states ' sovereignty , which is largely ignored in the commission proposal , there are other considerations which disturb us .
indeed , given the small number of potential global competitors , who are bound to reach agreement on the distribution of the available spectrum , we feel that it is pointless to impose the selection of operators .
even if this directive does not concern individual licences , it could provide a framework for discussions which the commission should try to complement .
like the rapporteur , i approve the commission 's concern to establish a harmonized community approach to the issue as soon as possible .
finally , we believe that prior to any international negotiations , community cooperation should be promoted , with a view to establishing a single position which the commission can then defend in international forums .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mr hoppenstedt 's excellent report brings us up to date on the implementation of an information infrastructure project of which the least that can be said is that it is truly global .
furthermore , the fact that a mechanism exists in the united states for granting space segment licences will give rise to discrimination against systems of non-us origin .
another step in the right direction is the proposed integration of the rules on the terrestrial infrastructure for satellite personal communications services into the harmonized system of licences and authorizations .
there does not appear to be any good reason for such a delegation of authority , which would also seem to be incompatible with the current statutes of that organization .
and when will the common framework for general authorizations and individual licences - which the commission has already submitted - make its progress through the legislative procedure ?
i should also like to raise some questions which , while they may be naive , concern what i regard as fundamental issues .
firstly , there are the conditions for harmonizing selection , as referred to in the reports and by previous speakers .
that is by no means an unwise move , if one recalls the saga of satellite broadcasting and the key role that it played in the establishment of private television channels .
my second point is that a market is being talked about here , and at the same time we are being told that there are currently three providers operating across the world .
they scored a partial success at the itu conference .
their share will not be enough to give them a decisive role , and they will certainly not be able to determine the course of events .
there are many possible definitions of a market .
where there is only one operator , however , there is no market , but rather a monopoly .
parliament has repeatedly warned us that while deregulation might break up public monopolies , it could open the way for private ones .
that is certainly not what we are doing , and the selection procedure , which has attracted various comments in the debate , must definitely not be the norm .
it may even be that it is the exception , and we go so far as to assume that that will be the case .
to that extent , we do not regard the arguments which have been put forward here in favour of the amendments as being conclusive .
of course the house was right to make the point in the debate that satellite personal communications will come under the general ' licences ' directive which is soon to be approved .
that is quite possible , and we can only hope that a compromise does emerge .
i can adapt to many things , but you must forgive me if i have some difficulties with that .
what i am saying is that we agree with the house on the need for action .
however , i am not sure that the council will move sufficiently on the basis of what parliament is proposing here .
nor do i see why a distinction should be made between systems that use the frequencies assigned to mobile telephony services and broadband multimedia systems , which also operate on higher frequencies .
in terms of regulatory policy , the two categories are quite comparable , and i do not think the difference in use is a justification for separating them .
let me end by saying that i have felt during this debate as if i was arguing with the council .
i will leave it to the house to decide whether or not that is a compliment .
thank you very much , mr bangemann .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
two or three-wheel motor vehicles
the european union as a whole needs to learn the lessons pioneered by the european parliament ; that good legislation is only made possible when you have constructive dialogue with the citizens who are directly affected .
this exercise has been made possible in this case because of the work of national and international bikers ' rights organisations coordinated by the federation of european motorcyclists , or fem .
i should pay a special tribute to their secretary-general , simon millward .
this process stands as a classic example of how to connect the citizen to the workings of europe .
the council must now take this backing seriously , unlike when it responded at first reading .
it is simply not acceptable for the council to ignore practical proposals such as the one that would make it unlawful to trade in illegal , noisy exhaust systems .
these are the systems that create the greatest nuisance and give biking in general a bad name .
nor can we allow manufacturers to brand specify replacement parts such as tyres .
the customer must be allowed to choose from a range of suitable replacement parts as long as they meet the relevant technical and safety specifications .
if the council 's position on anti-tampering was not amended , riders would be discouraged from the maintenance periodically needed to minimize pollution levels .
after all , it would be ironic if such proposals were by default to jeopardize the future of two- and three-wheel vehicles .
motorbikes have a positive role to play in providing an economical as well as an enjoyable form of personalized transport , causing far less congestion and pollution than their four-wheel counterparts .
sadly it seems inevitable that the council will not immediately embrace our amendments .
parliament has conducted a meaningful dialogue on this item and we will not take kindly to that work being ignored by ministerial officials meeting in secret .
a very important democratic principle is at stake .
mr president , we could have a very interesting discussion on what mr barton has said about the people concerned by this directive .
this is precisely what i wish to talk about .
given that the representatives of the non-bikers have not made themselves heard at all , i think that we in the house have actually done quite a reasonable job .
exhaust emission requirements are to be tightened up and the possibilities for tampering with engines drastically curtailed .
personally , i think this sends out entirely the wrong signal both to users and the industry .
all motorcycles sold in the netherlands and germany already meet strict standards , measured using even stricter methods .
the main argument put forward by the biking lobby , that these stricter standards will mean the end of air-cooled engines , is manifestly wrong if you look at which models are sold in the netherlands and germany .
the real problem is with souped-up engines and illegal exhaust systems , but up to now it has rejected every compromise proposed by those who take the noise problem seriously .
this fortunately includes the rapporteur and many bikers themselves , who have called for steps to be taken to enforce greater compliance with existing noise limits .
i sincerely hope that the negotiations that we will certainly have to hold with the council and the commission will produce satisfactory solutions to the problems of noise and the use of illegal exhaust systems .
terribly environmentally-friendly , do you not think ?
in fact , it is not .
as mr metten has already said , the council is refusing to deal with the problem of illegal exhaust systems , so all this is just window-dressing really .
not even the rules as they stand at the moment are being obeyed , and the police , for example in amsterdam , are sitting with their hands in their pockets .
so simply tightening up the rules will not achieve anything .
i would ask mr bangemann whether the proposed measuring system has been influenced in any way by pressure from the germans , whose technical skills could give bmw a major competitive advantage .
we need to have standards that are realistic and likely to gain public support .
so we should go for 82 decibels and a total ban on the production and sale of illegal exhaust systems , because they are the root of the problem , not the decibel level .
but it has missed the point here , because all marking and plating does , even for larger bikes , is to create more red tape .
the idea of using shear-bolts too will mean an enormous increase in costs for european bikers , who already find it expensive enough to maintain their machines .
finally , let us make an appeal to the bikers themselves . 82 decibels and an average measurement result are fine , but be strict with yourselves and with others .
do not allow those who spoil things for everyone and flout the rules to get away with it .
help the police to take effective action against offenders .
cooperate with the police .
then there will be no need to change the rules in 2001 , as amendment no 20 calls for .
i am looking up at the public gallery when i say : the ball is in your court .
mr president , in my opinion the council has given way to parliament on a number of issues .
a very sad state of affairs , in my opinion .
i cannot understand why we have to protect the bikers ' interests , and not the interests of these poor people .
why should they have to stay inside with their doors and windows shut ?
i find it both incomprehensible and disgraceful .
the possibilities for technical progress which parliament usually regards as so important when it comes to environmental issues are being completely ignored here .
the rapporteur is under pressure from the bikers ' lobby to which he himself belongs and which is still not content .
mr barton has tried to sink any attempt to tighten up the regulations .
the vast majority of my group remain totally opposed to giving any ground on harmful emissions or noise at second reading .
i really cannot understand what is happening here , and i can only hope that the council will stick to its guns in the next round .
mr president , on a point of order , it was mentioned that i was part of the bikers ' lobby .
as an elected member for all citizens in my constituency i take great exception to being considered part of the bikers ' lobby .
i will work with the bikers ' lobby and i will work with all responsible lobbies but i really resent being called part of the bikers ' lobby .
that is not true .
mr president , the european parliament can be quite content .
the council has incorporated almost all its amendments from the first reading in the common position , except on the permitted noise levels , where it would not accept parliament 's rather curious wishes .
and rightly so , in my opinion , because the noise limits originally proposed by the commission were included in the second phase of the directive as long ago as 1987 .
the house would lose all credibility if it decided to relax the noise limits now .
amendment no 11 would be a slap in the face for the innovative motorbike manufacturers who have voluntarily kept to the existing limits , only to be told in 1995 that they must now meet stricter requirements .
this sort of ungentlemanly conduct is not acceptable .
the bikers ' lobby argues that it is not the requirements that need to be tightened up , but how they are monitored .
they see maintenance as the problem and feel that emphasis should be laid on preventing mopeds and motorbikes from being tuned up , by banning the sale of tuning kits .
in fact , we must cover both .
bikers who make too much noise not only spoil things for others who are out enjoying themselves , they also spoil things for other bikers who behave in a more socially responsible and environmentally-friendly way .
the anti-tampering measures are absolutely essential , as are the stricter noise limits .
but we should not be thinking of simply keeping the 1987 noise levels in force until 2006 , as amendment no 3 proposes .
anyone who believes that this will put us in the best possible starting position for the conciliation procedure is entirely mistaken .
in negotiations , it is extremely important that your opponent takes you seriously , which is hardly likely to be the case here .
mr president , i should first of all like to commend all the many people , not least in denmark , who have campaigned actively for this proposal .
there has been effective lobbying by the motorcycling population , not only members of the well-known groups , but also ordinary office workers who ride their bikes on sunday .
they have helped to persuade the european parliament that the positive aspects of motorcyclists ' outdoor life should be supported .
the point here is that the commission has once again had its technical experts produce some fairly absurd regulations , without any regard for common sense or the realities of the outside world .
the standards for noise should match the actual situation .
and there are in fact not many people who can tell whether the noise level is higher than 82 decibels .
the commission should concentrate instead on ensuring that the motorcycles produced in europe do not suffer from unfair competition .
i very much welcome the substantial amount of work which mr barton has done on this issue , and there have been a number of creative attempts to bring the points involved home to the commission .
indeed , even mr bangemann has been for a motorcycle ride with mr barton to find out that parliament 's proposals were on the right lines .
mr president , this is a strange evening .
in the previous debate , i heard the kind of arguments which i normally encounter only in the council , and now i am listening to myself .
however , i am also prepared to go for a ride with mr barton , i have no difficulty with that .
however , i cannot accept the way in which mr barton has sought to exceed that process today , implying that he represented the people , whilst commissioner bangemann represented who-knows-what .
in any event , it is not industry that i represent in this case .
i have in fact tended to assume the role of my colleague mrs bjerregaard .
it has always been my position that motorcycles should be subject to the same standards which parliament applies to cars , light commercial vehicles and heavy goods vehicles .
it is not often that i agree with mr metten , but i was really impressed by his speech this evening .
it could have come from my own lips , and i can only congratulate him on it .
incidentally , i found it amusing that england beat holland 4-1 this evening , but four dutchmen spoke after mr barton , so that redressed the balance .
what course of action is open to us as things stand now ?
i would say that since the council has adopted a good many of parliament 's amendments , we should finally bring this process to a close .
the file has now run to 657 pages !
i would therefore ask you to appreciate that i cannot accept those amendments which seek to improve on elements already agreed by the council .
parliament will be doing itself a favour if it decides to accept in essence what the council has already accepted .
that is substantially more than the motorcycle lobby could have expected at the outset .
there is nothing wrong with lobbying , and of course people have to defend their interests , but motorcyclists are by no means the only people involved here .
there are also those who suffer from the activities of motorcyclists .
mrs van dijk reminded us of that .
i would add that you have no need to invite me to measure noise levels - invite mr barton and other members of the house !
i would not wish to imply that your invitation is in any way threatening - please feel free to invite me , but not so that i can listen to motorcycle noise .
there is no need for that . from the start , i have said that we should treat this issue just as you would any other .
i would therefore propose that we should accept nine of the 20 remaining amendments , namely nos 6 and 7 and nos 13 to 19 .
the latter are all concerned with the procedure for measuring noise levels , and their purpose is to reinstate the text originally proposed by the commission .
the common position made the procedure more rigorous , effectively introducing more stringent limit values .
i would point out that the measures to counter noise pollution are already tightened up considerably in the commission 's original proposal , because we are making the optional limit values binding .
with our proposal , we are therefore roughly midway between what the council is seeking - which is even tougher - and the significantly less stringent proposals from parliament .
we have already stated that quite clearly in article 15 of the framework directive .
we cannot accept amendment no 2 because trailers are definitely not covered by these provisions .
amendment no 3 seeks to postpone the date on which the limit values come into force .
if we wish to postpone the whole thing until the year 2006 , then we can let this go too .
why not , mrs van dijk , seek a postponement until 2026 ?
i wonder how that would be received ?
the amendment tabled yesterday on the same subject is likewise unacceptable and would create substantial delay .
amendments nos 8 to 11 are intended to delete various provisions relating to anti-tampering measures .
but with these amendments you would seek to permit , for example , any illegal modifications to motorcycles above a certain cubic capacity , in other words to big bikes .
do i see you shaking your head ?
this is something which we really cannot accept , therefore , and for that reason we have to reject , in this context , these measures whose only purpose is to allow performance-enhancing modifications with a minimum of risk .
we are unable to accept amendment no 12 on sound level limits .
in every other area , you find fault with us .
he will ask how we came to set such low limit values .
wait and see .
section 7 , paragraph 4 , contains the following note : ' l ' inclusion du point 4 ' .
it is in french , mr barton , if you would please bear with me .
france had a victory tonight too , so ...
the inclusion of paragraph 4 , ' provisions concerning the branding of components ' , in paragraph 3 implies that the provisions concerning branding will only apply to mopeds and light motorcycles .
in that case , mediumweight and heavy motorcycles would be completely excluded from the scope of the anti-tampering measures .
( de ) imagine such a situation , if you would !
caught between motorcyclists on the one hand and a group of decent people on the other , parliament has to find a way of remaining consistent .
you must stick to the line that you have taken - and things have come to a pretty pass when you need an industry commissioner to tell you that .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
leghold traps and pelts
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the subject of our debate is this object which i am holding up : a leghold trap .
is there anyone here who would like to place their leg or hand in it ?
- then you will find out what this method of catching animals is really like : a cruel and inhumane death .
this is what we are discussing here today , mr president .
we are also discussing a gross violation of community law by the commission and the gatt and the issue of the native peoples of canada and the united states .
let us begin with the gross violation of community law .
we had a regulation which is still in force , dating back to 1991 .
but the truth is that it should have entered into force on 1 january 1996 .
it so happens that by means of a press release and a letter signed by to commission officials , it was decided that the 1991 regulation would not enter into force .
mr president , i am no lawyer by i have been taught that in order to revoke a law or amend it a legislative act of equal judicial dignity is needed .
in other words in order to annul a regulation or amend it , it would have been necessary for the commission at some time in 1995 and according to legal procedures to present a proposal .
this was not done .
if it wanted to amend the regulation it failed to take action .
on 1 january 1996 it was already too late .
it is very important for the dignity of this house to make a response in order to safeguard the democratic legitimacy of applying legislation .
secondly , we are discussing the gatt .
the european parliament has been duped and i was one of those who fell into the trap .
does vice-president brittan speak with a forked tongue ?
what faith and confidence can we have in him ?
the third question is that of indigenous peoples .
there has been a lot of demagoguery about this , because it is a serious problem and must be dealt with seriously .
these are the figures - official figures from the canadian census .
only 1045 natives are full-time professional hunters .
according to the hunters ' association , they earn only 1 dollar for 5 dollar 's worth of pelt .
the money makers here are the fur traders and not the indigenous hinters , mr president . we have the figures here .
they should be entitled to take part in the negotiations which began a year ago , with consultative status .
we should open up negotiations with them .
i return to the subject of cruelty .
it is inhumane and cruel , it is impossible to allow animals to die in this way , allowing them to agonize for days on end - this cannot go on , regardless of any other considerations .
there are more humane , less cruel ways of hunting and killing .
at the end of the 20th century we cannot , as a civilised nation or people , allow this kind of thing to carry on .
mr president , the reason we have this report from mr pimenta today is that the commission has back-tracked on legislation properly carried by the european parliament and approved by the council of ministers .
there really is a serious problem of lack of democracy here , which we have to continue to pursue .
when the regulation of 1991 was approved it was agreed that imports of fur into the european union from countries which had not banned this barbaric and cruel leghold trap would cease in 1995 .
we had the debate about the substantive issue back in 1990 , withstanding ferocious lobbying in the process , and we won the argument .
it is a little unfair that we have commissioner bjerregaard here tonight to take the flak rather than sir leon brittan . but of course this is the price of so-called collective culpability , unfortunately .
so i am sorry for commissioner bjerregaard .
so it extended the deadline for a year until 1996 .
there is and there will be no such humane trap .
there is an available solution for the fur-trapping nations and that is to ban this leghold trap and to use some of the different kinds of methods which are available .
but let us face it ; the canadian government is making huge amounts of money from an industry designed for rich people to wear fur coats .
it is on quicksand as far as its arguments are concerned on this issue .
anyone with a grain of backbone would have been able to face up to this threat .
one could go on for hours about this sorry saga .
there is no case for the pathetic and weakkneed new proposal from the commission , belated though it is , and it knows it .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the issue of the so-called leghold trap regulation is a never-ending saga : this is episode five , if we are counting in years .
why is that ?
could it be that we took the wrong approach in trying to exert indirect influence , through legislation , on activities which quite justifiably meet with our disapproval ?
events would seem to support that conclusion .
since 1991 , it has been the position that the regulation was to enter into force on 1 january 1996 .
that should have allowed sufficient time to work out the implementing provisions .
although i was not a member of the house in 1991 , i would point out that the aim was to see more humane trapping standards applied .
in particular , the use of leghold traps was no longer to be permitted , and rightly so .
but the regulation has failed to meet its objective in this respect .
of course , there are various reasons why it has failed and i shall go on to analyse those reasons briefly , one of which i have mentioned already .
a dilemma then arose .
by the end of the year , no implementing provisions had been drawn up , so they could not be applied .
at this stage , the commission submitted a fresh proposal .
it is my view that this proposal cannot possibly be approved , for a number of reasons .
for a start , both the timeframe and the objectives are very vague .
on the basis of such a regulation or proposal , negotiations could go on forever and i think that cannot be in our interest .
what is presented in this regulation is an over-simplification .
mr pimenta , who courageously and quite rightly chose a different approach , therefore has my best wishes .
this is an approach that we can support , although i make no secret of the fact that we have different views and expectations on certain points .
let us consider the situation of the native peoples , especially in canada .
mr pimenta does indeed mention the figure of 1045 people , the fact that wages are low , and so on .
but there is another point that we must bear in mind : in the areas where these people work and hunt , there are no species which are threatened with extinction .
there are no problems with conservation and the environment .
the people are adamant that their areas should be preserved and protected from so-called ' industrial progress ' .
we therefore have a duty to take account of the native peoples and what they require to make their living .
the regulation does take account of these factors to some extent , and we have tabled some amendments which should improve the position .
i hope that they will also have the support of the house .
we do not agree with the rapporteur , however , that the implementing provisions themselves should be included in the regulation .
that is the commission 's task , which is for it to perform .
so we would remove the items in question , but i have to stress that this does not mean that we disagree with the way they have been formulated .
basically , all the commission has to do is copy them out .
however , we believe that their inclusion here would require the house to consider every change in detail , and we do not have the time .
we ought to bear that in mind .
it is a job for the executive , and in principle that means the commission .
if we bear that in mind , we may find the best way to proceed .
the working party is still seeking to establish standards , and however illusory these may be , they have not yet been ruled out .
where do you draw the line between humane and inhumane methods ?
perhaps the working party will eventually come up with an answer to that question .
the negotiations currently under way for the definition of standards for more humane traps are going well and represent a first step towards an international agreement founded on scientific knowledge and the concern better to protect animals .
that is a risk that we cannot accept and which can be avoided by adopting a reasonable time-scale for the entry into force of the rules .
we should bear in mind that combating unemployment is a priority not only of the individual member states but also of the union as a whole .
finally , one last point : on issues of interest such as this , it would be helpful if the commission consulted parliament in good time and not at the last moment as has happened in this instance .
mr president , there is really no need to go through all this again .
in 1991 , the european environment ministers decided to ban the import of pelts from countries where leghold traps are still used .
the ban was to come into force on 1 january 1996 , one year after leghold traps were banned in the countries of the european union .
we were therefore totally taken aback when , at the end of last year , the commission proposed that the import ban should be postponed indefinitely .
the commission has yielded to pressure from the fur trade and the threat from the united states and canada that they would fight the ban on the basis of the wto rules .
the interests of trade are apparently more important to the commission than democratic decisions to reduce the suffering of animals .
the european parliament must not make the same mistake .
what happened at the end of 1995 was that commissioner bjerregaard lost out to commissioner brittan , and i think she should be ashamed that things were allowed to go so far .
the european parliament must reverse the commission 's decision .
that would be completely unacceptable for us .
we all know that leghold traps deliberately condemn animals to a slow and lingering death , which is what makes the pelts such good quality and brings the best prices .
leghold traps are extremely brutal instruments and must be banned .
there must be more humane trapping methods , but we in the house must not allow ourselves to be blackmailed by postponements and other tactics into delaying the approval of these methods .
throughout the whole debate , the importance of leghold traps for native peoples has been deliberately exaggerated .
i entirely agree with the rules proposed by mr pimenta on the subject .
they provide for the ban on imports to be lifted once credible rules , including a reasonable implementation period , have been agreed .
commissioner , we all know that without clear rules and specific deadlines it is very difficult to ensure compliance with community law .
we have seen this with regard to the legislation on the substances that are destroying the ozone layer and on co2 levels , and we are seeing it with regard to this regulation .
this regulation must be implemented , if we wish to ensure respect for , and the credibility of , the community 's institutions .
mr president , this is lunacy !
here we have a five-year-old regulation - a piece of legislation adopted by the council - and the commission simply digs its heels in and fails to put through the implementing provisions .
is this what we can expect to see in future ?
along comes a lobby group - in this instance the canadian , american and russian fur industry - and kicks up a big fuss , and we are left with nothing .
if that is the shape of things to come , then we can save ourselves a great deal of work .
i think it is outrageous !
and where will we be then ?
we might as well shut up shop for half the week , because half our work is not being taken seriously by the commission .
what exactly do they think they are doing ?
i shall tell you another thing .
over the next year , there are to be talks on humane trapping methods , and humane traps are to be developed .
what rubbish !
there are no such things as humane traps .
whether or not there is a bit of padding on the teeth of a trap , the animal in it will die a miserable death .
nor is there such a thing as a selective trap .
an animal cannot read a sign that says ' lynxes please do not use this trap ' !
there are no selective traps .
protected species also get caught , and trapping is simply inhumane .
if people insist on catching animals , then they should be sensible and shoot them .
any other method is inhumane .
i fail to see one good reason for supporting the fur lobby , hunting animal species and damaging the environment to the point that they are now almost all extinct .
damn it all , why should a few people deck themselves out in furs ?
there is no call for it .
we must develop a different relationship with the gifts that nature has given us , and that certainly does not mean that we have to carry off the last remaining animal pelts .
as for those who are so concerned about human beings - and i hear endless expressions of sympathy for the poor native peoples - i have to tell them quite frankly that they are hypocrites .
mr president , our group firstly wishes to pay tribute to the work of mr pimenta , who has addressed this particularly complex question with his customary tenacity .
on the majority of these points , we agree with the committee on the environment 's proposals .
first of all , i should like to say that we must indeed put pressure on the negotiators to define satisfactory trapping standards .
too much time has been lost already .
by ensuring that the ban comes into force as soon as possible , we shall increase the chances of achieving a result swiftly .
even if it may sound paradoxical , or even absurd , you will see why the date of last january should be retained .
it is unthinkable for parliament to accept being presented with a fait accompli in this way .
it is a question of principle .
however , i would stress the fact that the interests of indigenous peoples whose survival may depend on hunting must also be taken into account .
the inability of the commission and their governments to conclude the negotiations must never constitute a threat to their way of life .
in this respect , while there are some sound points in mr pimenta 's arguments , we believe that it is preferable to follow the commission proposal .
our group will therefore be supporting the committee on the environment 's amendments , with the exception of amendment no 24 .
we too are aware that the number of genuine native hunters is relatively small , and that they are just about able to support themselves .
but this is no reason to stop them selling any more furs at all because of the trapping methods which they use .
here in europe we apply transitional measures in all kinds of situations , and i see no reason why we should not do so with trapping methods .
this is , after all , what this group of people relies upon to earn their daily bread .
we very much hope that all the political controversy surrounding this piece of european legislation will finally result in the speedy introduction of safer trapping methods .
there can be absolutely no doubt , as far as we are concerned , that these barbaric traps must be abolished .
the pimenta report is , in my opinion , a good compromise between the various viewpoints .
mr president , the rapporteur deserves to be thanked for taking over the job of doing the commission 's homework .
as we approach the end of the millennium , our society must give the same priority to preventing cruelty to animals - preventing unimaginable and prolonged suffering among living creatures - as it does to consumer protection .
preventing cruelty to animals is almost a form of consumer protection from a different angle .
it means protecting consumers from going about clad in the fashionably processed suffering of mammal species .
a person 's ethnic origin can never entitle them to use cruel trapping methods .
it is quite amazing that the usa and canada have so far refused to recognize that leghold traps are inhumane .
it is scarcely possible that regional development and the welfare of the people concerned should depend solely on the use of leghold traps , which are not even a traditional trapping method .
we should also recognize clearly that the decline in recent years in the sale of furs and skins is part of a pattern of changed practices on the part of consumers .
by following the proposals of the rapporteur , the european parliament would be sending out a positive signal .
mr president , as i stated in the last discussion about this issue , i was the hapless rapporteur on the first report on the leghold trap .
that was in 1990 .
in the course of preparing my report i did a great deal of research ; i took it extremely seriously .
i was the butt of - as mrs pollack has said - some of the most ferocious lobbying ever seen in this parliament .
i am very happy indeed that mr schnellhardt has said , on behalf of my group , that we will be supporting mr pimenta 's report .
but i wish i could agree with my colleague , mr schnellhardt , that the commission should be left to get on with the job .
i do not think it has done , and i do not think it did in the past what this parliament asked it to do in 1990 .
mr pimenta faces the issue that was the most agonizing for me , personally , in my work on the report : the serious concern he has for the indigenous people in canada .
i met them .
i went out on a trap line .
i have seen exactly what happens there .
as a result of what i saw then i deliberately set out to give longer time to develop an alternative method of trapping in order to cause the minimum amount of difficulty to the indigenous people in canada .
but unfortunately it took quite considerable time for anything to be done on that .
it was clear when i was in canada in 1990 that nothing had been done on it up to then .
but a lot of attitudes have changed radically in the last few years , particularly on issues of animal welfare .
nobody ever thought that the poor old cows or sows or whatever were really being taken seriously .
in the last few years we have started to look on these as moral issues .
i think we have to continue to do so .
i am very happy to support mr pimenta 's report .
finally , if i lived in northern canada in the cold and wind that exists there - and i lived in canada for well over a year in the 1960s - i would wear a fur coat .
i would probably wear one of those long furry things that were quite cheap and very practical at the time .
but the market for fur coats now has generally collapsed .
it is really only those rich people who live in southern hot countries who are buying them .
so i ask myself : do we really need to go the wall about a political issue like this ?
but the trap that mr pimenta has held up is evidence that this is a very nasty piece of work .
by now we should have found some alternative to it .
as was absolutely predictable , that postponement failed to produce the hoped-for results in the search for traps that do not involve cruelty .
first of all , i should like to thank the rapporteur , mr pimenta , for his report on the extremely vexed question of leghold traps .
i know that the commission and parliament essentially have the same goals in this area .
we differ as to how those goals can be achieved .
as is made clear by mr pimenta 's report , parliament is in favour of introducing a trade ban and then discussing the conditions for it to be removed .
given the fundamental difference in our approach , it will come as no surprise to the house that the commission is unable to accept the proposed amendments .
in addition , there was a direct proposal from mr eisma , who asked me for a response to parliament 's letter of 13 may to the commission .
the commission has not yet come to a decision on the request from the president of parliament for it to publish a list of countries which prohibit the use of leghold traps .
naturally , the commission will respond to this request within the deadline which it has to give a reply .
thank you very much , mrs bjerregaard .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
market organization in beef and veal
firstly , i should like to say that i am presenting this report on behalf of the committee on agriculture , in my capacity as chairman of that committee .
these amendments seek to increase the aid to specialized producers to ecu 50 for each animal .
i therefore believe that it is important to support these specialized producers , whose animals have never seen an ounce of meat meal in their lives , because they are reared on grass .
there are producers of this kind throughout europe .
this package is inadequate - and i am sure , commissioner , that you are aware of that today .
this means , however , that there is also a need to renegotiate a number of matters . the agreements on plant proteins concluded during the gatt negotiations must be discussed again .
we could discuss at length , mr jacob , whether there are specialized producers and , if so , which producers they are and whether priority should be given to that group or to others .
but what i do not want to see this evening is those producers who have specialized in obtaining premiums being advantaged .
more resources would certainly have been better but we have to be realistic .
we have then to be very careful to check that national aid becomes the exception and not the rule .
i therefore believe that it is for you this evening to show consideration for the work of our committee - our group , the socialist group , is counting on this .
mr president , since early 1996 , when the british secretary of state for health reported that new cases of creutzfeldt-jakob disease had occurred among humans in the united kingdom , beef consumption has once again plummeted .
the market for beef has collapsed not only in the united kingdom , but in virtually every region of europe , including member states which have not had a single case of bse .
thankfully , the commission has taken a range of measures , including buying in beef and an export ban to protect consumers .
to reduce the impact of the heavy losses suffered by beef producers , the commission promised an emergency programme .
for technical reasons connected with the budget , that programme must be paid for immediately , in other words by october 1996 .
we are grateful to the commission for its proposals .
the committee on agriculture and rural development has considered the document that was submitted and has formulated a number of principles for approval by the house .
the committee is calling for a standard subsidy for suckler cows and male cattle .
the subsidy should amount to an additional grant of ecu 10 per head .
at the same time , i must acknowledge that dairy farmers have also suffered losses .
the price of cull cows and calves has fallen just as sharply as that of beef cattle .
furthermore , the commission itself admits that it will be hard to include all the stock that should , in fairness , attract compensation payments .
virtually all the farms in these categories will be excluded , because they are not currently entitled to premiums .
for those reasons , the committee decided to increase the proposed sum to be made available to the member states to compensate for losses that would not otherwise be covered .
in the short time that is available , it will not be easy , even for the member states , to distribute this money in such a way as to compensate farmers to some extent for their losses .
we should therefore give the member states as much latitude as possible , so that they can get the money to the farmers in good time .
we have to be clear that these subsidies are only a drop in the ocean .
nonetheless we must make the most of them .
i shall be grateful to you if we can find a viable means of doing so .
there are countries which receive amounts far in excess of their entire production .
right at the head is luxembourg with 227 % , followed by ireland with 147 % and france with 123 % .
at the bottom , needless to say , is italy , which has received only 29.6 % , although with 2 , 200 , 000 head , it is europe 's main producer .
we therefore propose concentrating resources as much as possible on the national element by unhooking the measure from the system of premiums .
but that is not enough : it also seems appropriate to give the member states the opportunity to award national aid to offset the loss of income on cattle excluded from the premium .
to conclude , commissioner , the resources of ecu 650 m are clearly inadequate .
mr president , in our opinion the commission is entirely justified in proposing to make ecu 650 million available for dealing with the effects of the bse crisis .
the crisis which individual farmers are currently facing is not their fault , it is the result of failings on the part of the governments .
and if it is the governments which have failed , it is also up to the governments to put things right again .
we wonder whether ecu 650 m will be enough , but i am assuming that it is not possible to make more available at the moment .
we do have some fairly major objections to the commission 's proposal itself , which as we see it gives an unfair advantage to extensive cattle breeders .
the bse crisis affects all beef producers , both extensive and intensive farmers .
we therefore feel that measures must be taken which deal with both sectors fairly .
the amendments which have been adopted by the committee on agriculture are definitely heading in the right direction .
more is still provided for the extensive farmers , but the national governments are now in a better position to provide support for the intensive farmers too .
this gives the member states the scope to channel aid towards the sectors which they judge to have been worst affected .
we think it is also very important that this should not mean the renationalization of agricultural policy , as mr jacob suggested .
it does not need to be . the commission must be careful to keep a close eye on competition , but it is primarily up to the member states to take the lead here .
commissioner , a crisis of unprecedented gravity is affecting the cattle breeding sector in the european union .
and it is to be feared that as well as being exceptionally grave , it will be exceptionally long .
it took only a few days and a few decisions - or an inexcusable lack of decisions - for consumer confidence to be lost .
however , there is no doubt that it will take months , or even years , and also firm guarantees of quality control for that confidence to be restored .
breeders are hostages to this situation , and they no longer know what to do .
faced with a widespread slump in sales and unduly low selling prices , they still have to meet their costs .
commissioner , the least that can be said is that we were not caught unawares .
it was impossible not to know .
the laxity of the last few years was bound to have serious consequences .
it is unacceptable , it is criminal , that meat meal deemed unfit for consumption in the united kingdom should have been exported for consumption in other countries .
in any event , the bse crisis has demonstrated the fragility of the european union , the instinct for renationalization , and the failure - or rather the non-existence - of european policy .
i welcome the idea of setting aside a portion of the package to be distributed by the individual member states to meet the needs of farmers facing acute financial problems .
however , the crisis in the beef industry is unprecedented and much deeper than anything witnessed in the past .
in ireland alone it is estimated that losses so far - since 20 march - are in the region of irish &pound; 250 million .
the price fall has not yet levelled out .
in my view , stability will not return until decisive , radical and refocussed eradication measures are put in place and are seen by consumers to be producing results .
it is obvious that the size of this package is totally inadequate to meet the real losses incurred by farmers .
a package several times greater would be necessary to compensate farmers even for the losses incurred so far .
mr president , i wish to acknowledge the commission decision to provide ecu 650 million compensation package for farmers who have and still do experience serious financial losses resulting from bse .
the collapse of the beef market is undoubtedly the most serious catastrophe to hit european agriculture and indirectly , employment in the agri-food sector .
scientists differ in their interpretation of the impact , if any , of bse on public health .
consumers are understandably concerned and confused .
in relation to the proposed compensation package i would say to the commissioner that payment should be fast and efficient .
there is no need to remind the commissioner that the beef sector , even before the advent of bse , was in financial difficulty .
the problem with export refunds and the associated difficulty of developing third country markets had a bad impact on the profitability of the entire european beef sector .
i also believe that as a short-term measure and for the purpose of dealing with the build-up of animals due to the market collapse , beef heifers should be included with steers as being eligible for compensation .
i do not believe that the compensation package of ecu 650 million is sufficient , but it is a start .
we must put the system in place immediately for its implementation .
mr president , i seek to paint a broader picture here tonight . a week ago i brought four workers to brussels to make their case for recompense .
in two days they met many of the influential people and groups within parliament . you , yourself , generously gave them some of your time .
the workers returned home to northamptonshire buoyed-up and encouraged by the support from all sides . you , commissioner , are on record as saying that those most severely affected should have priority funding .
but fine words are cheap and that encouragement will soon melt away . i tonight would remind you of your words .
i would remind you of the undertaking in the treaty on the cap which promises the means for agricultural workers to find gainful employment .
first of all , do you agree that these workers are entitled to recompense and do you endorse it ?
secondly , that the funding that i have mentioned should and could be used for that purpose ?
thirdly , that although the uk government has opted out of objective 5 ( a ) it could and should be encouraged to take that option up again and use the money accordingly ?
fourthly , will you give an undertaking that all funding will be allocated on the basis of need , not just to farmers and abattoir owners but to everyone who has been so cruelly affected by this appalling disaster ?
mr president , i would like to add my voice to those expressing their concern about those beyond the immediate farms who are being affected by this crisis .
a county council in my constituency , shropshire , has produced this report .
i believe it is the first report of its kind to look at the local impact on the economy of the bse crisis .
it paints a very worrying picture .
we already know that at least 700 jobs have been lost in meat processing , road haulage and in the markets .
we also know that an estimated &pound; 100 million has been taken out of our local economy and that will have further knock-on effects .
we also know that this impact is being felt most acutely in our small market towns which already have fragile rural economies and that is why they already qualify for objective 5 ( b ) .
this is a blow that they just cannot cope with .
we now need to focus on how we can bring help to those people .
we need to look at objectives 5 ( a ) and 5 ( b ) .
possibly we need to look at something like a rechar or resider programme for agriculture , but action is needed very , very quickly .
commissioner , i have your copy here .
i will give it to you before you leave tonight .
there have been reports on the bbc tonight that the commission meeting here has worked out a formula for the end of the ban on british beef .
i would be very grateful if tonight you would tell us exactly what that formula is so that we can report it back to our constituents .
mr president , losses have been suffered .
very large losses have been suffered , commissioner , in this animal health disaster .
you have opted for the principle of solidarity .
you are making the responsibility collective , and that is all very well .
on this basis , compensation should be provided for all losses . but no , you have decided on a figure of ecu 650 million for the 81 million cattle that are affected .
that actually makes ecu 8 per animal . according to the proposal , it is ecu 10 per animal .
mr jacob 's proposal of ecu 50 per animal - which is little enough - has been rejected . and the idea of an additional premium for non-intensive farms has been rejected too .
in other words , you have rejected responsibility in favour of solidarity , and you have dismissed solidarity in favour of greed , mediocrity and accounting .
nor is there any provision for preventive measures - mr happart referred to this - or the renegotiation of the agreements on protein plants and oilseeds .
i must say , commissioner , that this affair is getting off to a very bad start .
put yourself in the place of the cattle breeders .
i understand why they have doubts about european integration and the protection that it will afford them .
the first point i have to emphasize is that since 20 march , beef producers throughout the european union have found themselves in a major crisis and have been facing serious financial pressures .
we have made use of every market instrument at our disposal , from an increase in export refunds to private storage , in order to at least reduce the impact of the problem .
like you , however , i am aware that all of this taken together is not enough .
we must go a step further and provide additional income subsidies .
there is a general consensus - and this was evident again from today 's debate - that producers must be helped as quickly as possible , with a minimum of red tape .
however , this also means that we must organize the income support within the 1996 budget .
the fact that the eaggf year ends on 15 october means that we must design our measures in such a way that they can be implemented before that date .
we therefore began by trying to estimate the loss of income among beef producers which could be expected in the current year , and to establish how much scope we had in the 1996 budget .
on that basis , we came up with the figure of ecu 650 million which is being discussed today .
as i told the house earlier in the month , an additional ecu 200 m has been earmarked for support measures in connection with bse .
when that is spent , however , we shall have exhausted all the scope available to us , according to the current estimates of our budget margin for this year .
this means that we cannot go above the sum of ecu 650 m .
we then come to the question of how the ecu 650 m is to be shared out .
under the first proposal , made by the commission on 20 may , additional payments were to be provided only to those producers who had claimed premiums for suckler cows or male cattle in the previous year .
while this option is a very simple one to implement , it does , of course , have certain disadvantages .
the member states therefore sought a more flexible approach and called for account to be taken of those issues which were not addressed adequately in the proposal .
according to the amendments from the committee on agriculture and rural development , it is now proposed to allocate a larger proportion of the total for national distribution and a smaller proportion for topping up cattle premiums .
moreover , we believe that we must take a rather cautious approach to further intensification of stock-farming , particularly in view of likely consumer trends in the union .
finally , as regards the option of providing national subsidies , i would point out that measures of this kind were applied during the last beef crisis in 1990 and 1991 .
by providing government subsidies , member states can address specific problems of their own that are not fully covered by the community resources .
on the question of assistance for those employed in the processing industry , i would remind you that i addressed that issue in depth during question time earlier today .
president santer , in his speech tomorrow morning , will give his detailed views on the commission decision this evening on the so-called framework programme submitted by the british government .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
( the sitting was closed at 12 midnight )
topical and urgent debate ( objections )
the next item is the vote on objections concerning the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance ( rule 47 ) .
on item ii , nuclear waste :
the reports by mr alavanos , mr mendiluce pereiro , mr giansily , mr titley and mr pex are of course concerned with this subject .
i am very surprised that you should ever have allowed the motion by the group of the european people 's party .
in doing so you have created a precedent !
european council in florence - igc
the next item is the joint debate on :
i have also arranged for the italian minister for foreign affairs to be informed of this .
the president of the commission , mr santer , is prepared to open today 's debate by giving his statement .
mr santer , please take the floor .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the european council to be held in florence in two days ' time is of special significance for the future of our union .
i am therefore pleased to have this opportunity of letting you know the commission 's position on what it considers to be the priority items on the european council 's agenda .
before doing so , however , i would first like to congratulate the italian presidency on the work accomplished during the last six months , of which florence will be the crowning achievement .
the task has not been easy .
the problems confronting the union have been numerous and difficult , and the internal political situation in italy can hardly have failed to add to the worries of mr dini and his colleagues .
in spite of that , they have succeeded in driving forward the european ship by keeping the union as one of their foremost priorities .
they have held to the course identified at the madrid european council despite all the cassandras and siren voices that could have deflected them from the direct route to the achievement of our objectives .
i should like to offer my sincere thanks to the italian authorities , and more particularly to mr dini for his dynamic and enthusiastic contribution as president of the european council and of the general affairs council .
mr dini will shortly be giving you a complete survey of the european council 's florence agenda .
it is still the business of the presidency to decide on this agenda , so that i can restrict myself to dealing with the commission 's major priorities .
as has often been said , employment is our first priority .
everybody should shoulder their responsibilities and everybody should take on concrete commitments at their own level .
the foundations of the strategy for jobs now exist and are sound .
moreover , my tour of european capitals has confirmed to me that all the governments and all the social partners are more than ever aware that the highest priority must be given to the fight against unemployment .
the approach outlined in my proposal for the confidence pact has been welcomed in the great majority of capitals .
the panel of social partners has stressed its importance and urgency , and the tripartite conference held in rome last weekend gave it wide support .
the conclusions of this conference totally agree with the commission 's communication and correspond exactly to the spirit of my proposal , seeking a mobilization of all those involved and an assumption of responsibility at all levels .
i hope the european council in florence will follow the same line and that the heads of state and government will build on the foundation of the support recorded for the pact .
the confidence pact is not something that can be achieved overnight .
this must be done as a matter of urgency and to the greatest possible extent .
something concrete must be achieved in the short term .
secondly , full exploitation of the potential of the internal market .
some real progress must be made before the end of the year in order to complete and improve it .
our competitiveness must be strengthened , small and medium-sized enterprises must be helped and our access to world markets must be opened up .
one aspect particularly close to my heart is the construction of trans-european networks .
these are an indispensable element in the infrastructure and without them the potential of the internal market cannot be fully realized .
the european council has expressed its own wishes in calling for trans-european networks .
it should now , this time once and for all , decide on the resources to be made available for their construction .
the commission has made its proposal in line with this reasoning and i ask the european council to be faithful to the same reasoning , which in any case follows from its previous decisions .
fourthly , as a matter of priority , using european structural policies for job creation in allocating the uncommitted ecu billions available up to 1999 .
that , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , is our first priority for the european council .
the message from the heads of state and government should be one of confidence .
a message of confidence , i also hope , for the second major item on the florence agenda : the intergovernmental conference .
ladies and gentlemen , let us be frank .
the situation at the moment does not fill us with enthusiasm .
the italian presidency has started work with a great deal of commitment , and it is not their fault if their work lacks dynamism .
we have to recognize that negotiations have not really started .
let us not make the mistake of thinking we have plenty of time or that we can calmly await clarification of the political situation in this or that member state .
the problems to be solved are numerous and complex .
do the negotiators fully understand this urgency ?
have they a clear vision of the aims of the intergovernmental conference ?
i heard them from many delegations during the conference which has just been held in rome .
i conclude from this that there is an awareness among member states that something has to change .
this awareness must be transformed into a new impetus that the european council should give to the work .
the political will expressed at the opening of the intergovernmental conference in turin on 29 march must be confirmed .
we must change into a higher gear .
we must fully commit ourselves to negotiation , and do so at a level worthy of the high ambitions for the future of an enlarged , more securely based and efficient union .
our farmers throughout the union have suffered serious financial losses , consumer confidence has been undermined , our institutions have been paralysed and the damage caused by the crisis is severe .
the european council offers the chance of a turning point , a chance that must be seized .
yesterday evening , the european commission set out its position , which it will formulate in a document for florence at the request of the general affairs council .
one principle is essential for the commission .
all our actions must be based on , and inspired by , the absolute and sole imperative of protecting the health of our citizens .
lifting the ban on british exports is therefore strictly conditional upon the eradication of bse .
since the source of this disease is in the united kingdom , it is the british authorities who must put into effect the eradication measures required for the ban to be lifted .
this has been the constant position of the commission ever since the beginning of the crisis on 21 march , and it will remain its position until the end of the crisis .
it will not be affected by political pressure , by blocking moves , even by the use of the veto .
the biggest mistake that could be made would be to turn the crisis into a politicians ' issue .
we cannot play around with health !
there will be no blank cheque !
the commission for its part will contribute fully to the search for a solution to the crisis .
to put it bluntly , the commission expects the policy of non-cooperation to end. without this commitment , there will be no agreement in florence !
( loud applause )
thank you mr president of the commission .
the italian minister for foreign affairs and presidentin-office of the council of the european union , mr dini , is also here now .
i should like to welcome him most warmly , and ask him to speak straightaway .
mr president-in-office , please take the floor .
the florence council will mark an important stage in the approach to and preparation for the great deadlines that await the union .
from this viewpoint , the revision of the treaty is a priority .
the turin european council , a crucial episode in the italian presidency 's term , set an agenda for the work of the intergovernmental conference .
in rome we jointly recognized that one stage of the conference was completed , and another - the real negotiations - must now begin .
i am especially thinking of the third pillar , where union citizens expect a specific response in terms of guarantees of their security and respect of their rights .
but i am also thinking of the chapter on the common foreign and security policy , which must also make progress as part of the new prospects opened up for european defence by the nato ministerial meeting in berlin .
it is now up to the conference to draw the consequences for the european union of its relationship with the western european union .
italy has sought a broad interpretation of the formula for associating the european parliament with the intergovernmental conference , and has arranged for all the conference working documents to be sent to you .
we take responsibility for passing on to the future irish presidency an interim report summarizing the work done so far and setting out the progress achieved .
the slowdown in economic growth at the end of 1995 and the start of this year have made the fight against unemployment even more dramatic , if that were possible .
in the face of this disturbing situation , there is a clear awareness that no miracle answers exist and direct responsibility for dealing with the problem still remains at the national level .
but this does not justify failure to act or lack of initiative at union level .
the message to the european council on this is extremely clear .
the madrid european council specified the route to achieving economic and monetary union , based on the criteria and timetables laid down in the treaty .
it is no accident that not one member state has called for the debate on economic and monetary union to be re-opened in the process of reforming the treaty .
i need not waste many words reminding you that cooperation in justice and home affairs is a strategic factor for the future of the integration process .
it is now well-known that in this area the ambitions of the majority of the member states and the gravity of the transnational phenomenon we face are in increasingly strident contrast with the institutional tools we have available .
the european council will essentially be called on to discuss the outstanding issues of extradition and europol .
the italian presidency has made every effort to meet the deadline of 30 june set in cannes for resolving the problem of the court of justice 's powers under the europol convention .
the continued opposition of one delegation to every compromise proposal formulated has prevented the justice and home affairs council from reaching agreement .
so the matter must be discussed at the european council , when the presidency intends to emphasize once again the serious political damage done to the union as a whole by a lack of decision-making capacity .
the reform of the current mechanism for the third pillar will be one of the surest measurements for evaluating the results of the conference .
certain subject areas still restricted at present to cooperation of the predominately intergovernmental type , and therefore bound by the need for unanimity , should be progressively brought into the community sphere .
this route will make it easier to resolve some serious outstanding problems like free movement of persons .
the progress of the council 's activities has been greatly disturbed in the last few weeks by the attitude of the british government over the mad cow crisis , which president santer has described .
we have demonstrated this spirit of solidarity both at the turin council and at various meetings of the agriculture council devoted to this issue .
the second consideration is the responsible handling of issues involving consumer protection and public health .
the decision to raise the ban on certain by-products taken by the commission a few days ago , is confirmation that there is no intent to persecute or excess of zeal in the way this crisis is being handled .
all this must occur under two very specific and strict conditions : close control by the commission of the whole agreed plan and scientific evaluation by the relevant committees of all the measures to be implemented .
respect for these conditions is indispensable to restoring order and certainty to the beef market .
i want to reiterate the points i made to you the day after the turin european council on some useful lessons the bse crisis has taught us .
subsidiarity , deregulation , and simplification of rules are key themes for the balanced development of the union , upgrading local and individual initiatives and eliminating unnecessary burdens on firms and citizens .
the decision reached on 17 june by the transport council on the major networks is particularly significant .
a substantial part of the european council 's work will be devoted to the external relations of the union .
too often - and often rightly - the union is criticized for a structural incapacity to act consistently on the international scene .
the ultimate aim is to project a reliable and coherent image of europe outside and inside the union , injecting real substance and content into its international role .
developments in former yugoslavia will be in the foreground at florence .
the italian presidency has sought to keep a high european profile in implementing the peace agreements , and establishing a regional approach to the consolidation of the peace and the future stability of the entire area .
it was also an occasion to seek greater commitment from the parties implementing the dayton agreements .
the european union troika also played an active part in the sharm-al-sheikh meeting and the follow-up to it , seeking a balanced and global approach to the problem of combatting terrorism with a view to sustaining the peace process .
at florence the importance europe attaches to the continuation of the peace process must be reiterated and an urgent appeal along these lines sent to all the parties involved .
special emphasis will also be laid on the great progress achieved in these six months in the construction of the euro-mediterranean partenariat , agreed at barcelona .
this progress reflects our conviction that no project for political and economic synergy between the two shores of the mediterranean can develop profitably without the creation of a dense network of relationships and common interests between the two societies .
the italian presidency has done its utmost to find a compromise formula or mediation approach which would break the deadlock currently holding up the progress of the regulation .
but we are pursuing this with maximum determination , while respecting community solidarity and understanding the extremely delicate implications of this negotiation , in particular for one member state .
as regards transatlantic relations , we have tried to implement the new transatlantic agenda , approved on 3 december in madrid .
the consequences of these measures on community economic operators and the disruption they might bring to the multilateral trading system are causing great concern in the union .
the florence council will reflect these concerns , sending a clear political signal to washington that the union 's intends to confront future developments in this matter with determination .
finally , the results achieved at the europe-asia meeting in bangkok , introducing a novel element into euroasian relations , must be given due prominence at florence .
on that note i will close . thank you for your attention .
( applause )
thank you very much , mr dini .
i shall now call upon the author of the oral questions , mr mor&aacute;n l&oacute;pez , to speak .
mr president , mr president-inoffice of the council , mr president of the commission , i should firstly like to thank you for the clear and detailed information you have given .
the responsibility for organizing the launch of the intergovernmental conference has fallen to the italian presidency .
it is not necessary to remind the house that , at this stage of the process of european integration , the work of this conference is crucial .
on the one hand , it must strengthen and consolidate europe 's institutions ; and , on the other , it must fine-tune them with a view to the enlargement of the union .
we should remember and applaud the fact , in this context , that when the italian presidency addressed the issue of the participation of parliament in the intergovernmental conference , it took a positive line .
the stance adopted by certain other member states , on the other hand , will prevent parliament from participating to the extent that it was involved - and with good results , i believe - in the reflection group .
there is therefore a need to recognize this and address the important issues with which the conference will deal from the perspective of parliament and the committee on institutional affairs .
we know that in its initial stages , under the italian presidency , the conference has identified the member states ' positions as regards the issues involved in the revision of the treaties .
with regard to employment and social protection , the european public wishes them to be dealt with in a separate treaty chapter .
i welcome mr santer 's words and initiatives in this respect .
the union 's institutions must be more effective , more democratic and more transparent .
we know that at the current stage of the conference , issues such as the weighting of votes , the extension of qualified majority voting and the simplification of legislative procedures have not yet achieved a minimum consensus .
mr president , i should like to begin by thanking both mr santer and mr dini for their speeches this morning .
the detail of much of what they have said will be taken up by colleagues from my group who will speak later in this debate .
as leader of the socialist group , i want to concentrate on the major political issue which currently confronts the union .
my group today wants to make it entirely clear that we utterly condemn the aggressive and offensive campaign waged by conservative politicians and some of the media in the united kingdom against our partners in the rest of europe .
the british government has chosen a policy of non-cooperation with its partners in europe .
they have chosen to veto european actions across a wide spectrum .
they have been responsible for preventing action , for example , to fight fraud in europe and to deal with insolvency by which so many companies in europe are affected .
unbelievably , they have refused to allow 1997 to be designated european year against racism .
these , amongst approximately 70 other eu actions , are all vetoed .
i ask myself : is this an appropriate , reasonable or coherent way to make friends and influence people ?
is this the way to solve a crisis of consumer confidence ?
will it deal with the real public health fears of europe 's people ?
the answer has to be no .
perhaps the british government has cause to bring the european union to its most serious decision-making crisis ever .
have i missed something ?
was bse exported to britain by another member state of the union ?
of course not !
the british government 's inept handling of the british-generated bse crisis has led to collapsing beef sales all across europe .
all the european union 's industry is paying the price for one government 's incompetence .
this friday and saturday in florence our fifteen prime ministers have a job to do .
they must take real action to fight the scourge of unemployment in europe which mr santer so eloquently described .
for my group it is entirely unacceptable and unforgivable for one government to prevent action on measures to create jobs when that same government has in its own hands the resolution to this institutional crisis .
abandonment in britain of government control has allowed free rein to an industry responsible for contaminating massive swathes of its own country 's dairy and beef herds .
where is the morality in that ?
where is the sense of decency and where is any modicum of acceptable business ethics .
in the view of my group this is the political reality of ill-considered , ideologically motivated deregulation of the thatcher sort .
yesterday the commission adopted a framework agreement for dealing with bse which is designed to come into being simultaneously with the abandonment of the british government of its policy of non-cooperation .
we welcome that positive signal from the commission but there can be no half measures .
the conservative government in britain must abandon its non-cooperation policy fully and immediately and the framework agreement must be posited on substantiated scientific data .
i am a londoner , i am british and i am european .
i am proud to be all of these .
i call on the british government to respond in the spirit of the treaty and allow europe to function for the good of all .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mr president-in-office , mr president of the commission , i think we all agree that the european union is going through a severe crisis , for two reasons .
the first is the risk which looms of a crisis of public confidence in europe 's ability to safeguard something as essential as public health .
it would be paradoxical if the european idea were to founder in a crisis of confidence over contaminated animal feed and the risks of the disease being transferred to humans .
for this reason the commission must draw up a plan with the aid of independent experts and get this disease eradicated .
i think the most important need now is to restore confidence .
some member states have had the courage to tackle this in the past .
in my country amongst others we eradicated swine fever with help from the european union .
and the crisis is extremely acute because the fundamental rules of the european union are being challenged .
we live and work in a legally constituted community which is based on fundamental rules of law .
respect for community law , and respect for article 5 of the treaty , means that a member state cannot place itself outside the european system of law by deliberately blocking the normal working of the european union .
so the uk government 's policy of non-cooperation has consequences , for public opinion , and for ourselves too .
this policy of non-cooperation has done more than anything else to highlight the need , the urgent need for more widespread majority decision-making in the council .
these , then , are the two fundamental problems facing the florence european council .
there is no doubt , mr president-in-office , that the meeting will be dominated by these two fundamental questions .
we hope a solution will be found to them .
in recent months parliament has been accused of being too long-suffering , has been criticized for that .
it is true that we have spent much time and effort on efforts amongst the big groups to talk and to seek a solution .
without success , unfortunately .
this is why the resolution put down by various groups of people from the various political groups is particularly clear and particularly critical .
i hope the european council will take this resolution seriously .
we had hoped that the florence council would be a council for jobs .
we need to talk about the igc , of course , about foreign policy , but the major objective was jobs .
the most original feature of this debate , i think , was the promise you made on jobs , mr president of the commission .
but your statement , your ambition to establish the social dialogue , your ambition to find new ways and means of solving the enormous social problem of unemployment , are especially original and promising .
they are a sign of hope .
true , the presidency 's work was made more difficult by the national elections and the crisis in relations between great britain and the european union .
here the question of the single currency also needs to be clarified .
europe cannot look eastward only , it must also turn its spotlight on the south .
mr president , paradoxically there is a useful side to the otherwise unjustifiable blocking of european union decisions by great britain .
in fact it demonstrates to the full the fragility of the union 's present institutional mechanism .
intergovernmental cooperation is a cumbersome and inadequate instrument : that has been seen and is still seen in the european union 's lack of presence in foreign policy , as witness yugoslavia .
it is a real contradiction to have a common currency , but no common economic , fiscal , or employment policy , no common foreign policy , and no common justice policy .
the group of the european liberal , democratic and reformist party hopes that contradiction will be resolved in a positive way and that europe will take the path of federalism .
the intergovernmental conference is certainly not moving in that direction , at least not so far , and president santer was right to state that clearly .
when the council opens in florence , i hope the italian government will recognize all this frankly , and make it no routine meeting but a turning point in the political history of european integration .
mr president , on behalf of my group , the european united left , i should like to make three comments which reflect three general but deep concerns .
the first is the impression that the intergovernmental conference is becoming dissipated and stagnating , with the added problem of the bse crisis .
it could be said that the conference has begun to lack intensity and substance . we wish the conference to be consolidated .
we wish to see fresh impetus given , and decisions taken at the florence summit which signify that the igc exists and is meeting with a response from the european public .
the second concern is the role of the european parliament .
we are calling for the requirement of parliament 's assent for any revision of the treaties to be recognized swiftly and written into the treaty .
we must work harder all round , in every sense , starting with the florence summit .
such attacks call into question and threaten the future of europe , and they do not augur well for good progress at the intergovernmental conference .
it does not solve the employment problem if the most we can do is offer firms new profit margins , which provides no guarantee of employment , and also damages the environment and social security .
nor are we satisfied with what we have heard on foreign policy .
we have heard nothing about albania .
we have heard that the turkish premier will be present in florence despite was is going on in turkey internally and externally , and we do not have a commitment to meda .
but we are satisfied that this administration has finally made an agreement with slovenia .
will the italian presidency support these priorities ? will it confirm that the ban will only be lifted when the disease has been eradicated ?
does the italian presidency confirm that any decision on the subject will be based first and foremost on the most precise scientific evidence possible ?
mr president , i was rather surprised and pleased by mr santer 's words on taking up his office : less and better .
in 1993 , there were 17 000 eu rules , so a clear-out was needed in the mass of legislation .
now the subsidiarity principle was to be applied : let the member states take care of those matters which cannot be dealt with better in brussels .
it was the right approach , but unfortunately mr santer has not been able to deliver the goods .
there are now 21 392 regulations , directives and other laws .
the quantity of legislation has increased elevenfold in 22 years .
but instead of a clear-out , it is now planned to press on regardless with majority decision-making and hence more government from brussels .
we propose a different approach . the limits of the eu 's powers should be defined , so that it deals with international topics .
eu legislation should begin and end in national parliaments , so our citizens are able to keep track of it .
the commission should only put forward proposals if asked to do so by the national parliaments .
the eu should only be able to adopt common minimum rules , and standards should become a voluntary means of assistance instead of a centralized dictatorship .
it is all very well to have common minimum rules on the employment of children , but my wife and i do not need an eu directive to decide whether our son should deliver newspapers .
( the president interrupted the speaker ) ...
and i would not least suggest to the president of the commission that he should open the florence summit by putting forward a long list of proposals to abolish ...
( the president cut the speaker off )
i do not think italy has brought any honour upon itself with its lax attitude to slovenia over property taken from italians and not yet restored .
we ought to be trying to protect the physical and moral health of these people , and protect our economy .
we are delighted with the initiative to create a european observatory for racism and xenophobia and we would modestly suggest a home for it .
i have received eight motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .
after all the talk of recent years , we expect the italian presidency to close the six months by bringing concrete proposals and measures to florence .
what is more , mr dini , you won acclaim from parliament by committing yourself to that last time you were here .
i appreciate the italian government 's decision to hold a national conference on employment as an operational follow-up to the confidence pact between the social partners , an initiative we resolutely support and consider extremely important .
this is a fundamental political issue which demonstrates the capacity of the european union to intervene in the economy at moments of crisis .
we are hoping for long-awaited concrete measures , and if they do not come it would be better to abandon the employment programmes .
we are alarmed at delay which could turn into paralysis , loss of the sense of europe and the general interest , and regression to purely national visions .
our criticism goes out to all the governments holding back the work on significant issues .
mr president , it is the heartfelt hope of the great majority of this parliament that the florence european council is not remembered only for the mad cow crisis .
the joint resolution to wind up this debate refers to the issues on the table : the intergovernmental conference , employment , the cfsp , the third pillar , the internal energy market .
great hopes hang on the effective capacity to finalize a timely and credible response to the tragedy of unemployment .
this is a tragic situation , which goes well beyond tolerance limits and has serious economic , social and civil consequences , affording easier penetration to organized crime .
so i want to thank you and support you , president santer , on the method adopted and the merits of the european commission 's proposal .
we are pleased to note president dini 's assurance of availability , on behalf of the council .
next week 's european summit must concentrate on defusing the tensions which have been allowed to build up in recent weeks between the british government and its european partners .
the policy of non-cooperation which the british government is now pursuing in brussels has had an entirely negative impact and must be abandoned at the earliest opportunity .
in britain much of the anti-european rhetoric which has been unleashed following the government 's decision to adopt an obstructionist approach to european decision-making has been profoundly disturbing .
responsible political leaders in london must now take the initiative and reassure the british people that they have nothing to fear from their neighbours in the european union .
the european union must also take steps to restore the confidence of consumers and producers in beef as a healthy , safe and marketable product .
it is imperative that the protection of the health of our citizens is our only priority and that all decisions will be based on the best scientific evidence available .
i commend president santer on his principled stand on this issue , defending the citizens of europe .
the beef crisis has already diverted attention from important work under way in the intergovernmental conference .
the beef crisis has diverted attention away from fighting unemployment and international crime .
the intergovernmental conference must prepare for the expansion of the european union to include the former communist countries in eastern europe .
it is important that these negotiations are undertaken in a calm and rational manner .
unfortunately , the debate on europe which has been under way in the british media has been characterized by an absence of calm and rational comment .
finally , the danger now is that agreement at the igc will be much more difficult to achieve because of the antieuropean forces unleased in the united kingdom .
mr president , the first point i want to make to you is about the credibility of our institutions on the occasion of the florence european council .
who knows what the florence european council will talk about on 21 june ?
and what does the european parliament do , beyond the ritual liturgy ?
have we been able to influence the agenda ?
as we all know , eighteen million people are unemployed in europe , not to mention the millions of unemployed who are not counted , and the winds of recession are blowing .
if it was raining at first , in terms of unemployment , it threatens to hail tomorrow .
and what is europe doing ?
very little in our opinion and that in the wrong direction , as the speeches by president santer and minister dini today confirm .
we are very worried and alarmed . we believe that unless there is a radical change in direction the crisis in europe has already begun .
mr president , mr president of the commission , the motion for a resolution tabled by the committee on institutional affairs is quite right to complain about the status quo tendency of the intergovernmental conference 's work so far .
but has this parliament done enough to overcome this policy of timidity and lack of imagination ?
where should the initiative for such a process ...
( the president cut the speaker off )
mr president-in-office , mr president of the commission , it is already three months since work on the igc opened officially in turin and we are forced to recognize that we find ourselves in a blocked situation .
we think it is time to sound the alarm since , in our opinion , the problem is not restricted to the question of the british veto , unacceptable as it is .
there is a real danger of getting bogged down , of a woolly compromise and of a downward revision of the treaty , against which the european parliament should rebel .
there is , in particular , a marked absence of political impetus and of an overall vision , which are lacking at the very moment when the building of the community has to face crucial challenges .
are we ready , as an institution , to respond to these challenges when faced with the hesitations of our governments ?
my group is convinced that there is no alternative to the pursuit of integration and that this will only be viable on a federal type basis .
mr president , on the eve of the florence council , the governments of member states still seem to be hesitating to endorse the federalist proposals that the european institutions are urging upon them .
they are right to take a second look at them , since by listening to bad advice from the europe of today , they would jeopardize the opportunities for the europe of tomorrow .
today 's europe is divided into peoples .
we need not ask why : it puts the abolition of frontiers before security , free trade before jobs and health , and superstates before the sovereignty of the people .
how would citizens identify themselves in such a europe ?
the mad cow affair is unfortunately a good illustration of our drifting off course and the igc should learn the lessons from this if it really wants to solve the problems of concern to citizens .
to stop such a slide , however , we must adopt strict standards and a genuine community preference .
third lesson : the abolition of controls on goods at internal frontiers on 1 january 1993 has at the same time dismantled information and verification systems and has increased fraud .
this must be rectified as a matter of urgency .
we think the igc should allow better control over the powers of the commission and that it should impose on that body a general duty of transparency .
it is not so much the cows that are mad as the utopian project that we are always chasing after .
the british government , like the anglo-saxon multinationals involved in totalitarian feeding , like the commission and like the governments of our countries , bears an overwhelming responsibility for the undermining of both cattle feed and human foodstuffs .
but it is scandalous to use this situation in an attempt , practically if not institutionally , to get round the unanimity rule .
the british government , after all , is defending its own interests .
whether it is trying to continue exporting its glaucous gelatinous products is its business .
it is up to others not to accept these goods .
we have here a striking demonstration that it is absurd to seek to merge the old european nations .
too much europe is killing europe .
the europe we wanted and still want is one with a multiplicity of cooperation agreements , between states of course , but even more between industrial , commercial and agricultural enterprises .
by dint of seeking to govern and legislate in all areas , we arrive at a situation where any crisis in a single area leads to a threat of a general break-up .
that is what will happen sooner or later , since no yoke can hold peoples who want to be free .
putting an end to the unanimity rule is finally allowing the commission to exercise increasingly compulsory powers .
there is thus nothing to say that legislation will not be forced on us tomorrow on euthanasia , the liberalization of drugs or the democratic legalization of satanic cults .
mr president , i believe that mr santer presented the issue in its proper terms this morning .
however , the president of the commission will perhaps agree with me that the crisis of confidence of europe 's citizens in the community institutions may be caused partly by certain past actions of those same institutions .
i trust that the president-in-office , with his characteristic rectitude , will prevent the council of ministers from being turned into a forum for political horse-trading .
lastly , i wish to express my clear support for the stance of the president-in-office .
europe began with a greek god in the form of a bull .
i am sure that it will not end with an insular mad cow .
for this reason , the introduction of the principle of taking majority decisions in all matters involving legislation is the clear consequence of the bse crisis .
this is one of the tasks that we must set ourselves at this intergovernmental conference .
president dini , i am grateful to you and to mr faggiolo for your friendly attitude towards parliament .
let me make a second comment .
the nato council in berlin has taken away the excuse used by all those who , on the grounds of their alleged consideration for the usa , were previously against a defence-policy identity for the european community .
i believe that these tasks will have to be set by this intergovernmental conference , as will many other things .
allow me to make one final comment .
mr santer , i am grateful to you for your remarks .
if you are going to stick to these conditions accordingly , then we are also in a position to make this clear to our consumers .
i should like to make three observations .
the first , to say to you , mr president of the commission , that we particularly appreciated your speech .
this morning , you set out in magisterial fashion the order of priorities : nothing is more important than public health .
it was essential that europe should declare this to be its position and should do so in the strongest terms , here and now .
having said that , we should not forget the reality , soon to be a tragic reality , of the economic problems that are about to arise .
the necessary steps must be taken to reverse the tide of opinion both internationally and amongst buyers outside the union .
the second remark is to say that the position of great britain is morally indefensible and politically completely irresponsible .
to mix up the problem of the beef crisis with the functioning of european institutions is pointless and scandalous , unless it is a deliberate and in the end convenient camouflage of a wish to block the igc .
thirdly and lastly , the igc should fight back .
florence should mark a new turning point : europe cannot afford the luxury of a crisis .
we ourselves are pleased at the firm determination of the french authorities to create the conditions for this initiative at the florence summit .
instead , it has been hijacked by the behaviour of one member state .
the waters of a flood of anglo-saxon self-delusion are lapping at the steps of the fortezza del basso .
many people in britain are shocked , saddened , angered and ashamed by the antics of the british government .
the president-in-office of the council spoke of solidarity with the british government .
i make two suggestions .
to the british government i say : wake up .
conservatives are supposed to believe in strong leadership .
if they still do , then it is time to start showing some .
to the rest of europe i say : do not give in to blackmail .
my constituents have suffered more than most from the bse crisis .
but it would do no favours to britain , or to the union , to give the impression that these tactics have worked and it would probably result in an unworkable agreement .
as british ministers should know all too well , it is never right to negotiate when someone is subjecting you to blackmail .
now they should learn that there are no exceptions to that rule .
in my view , president santer 's negative judgement is on the deadlock in the construction of europe as a whole .
one need only think of what we regarded as positive intentions proposed in turin , which have remained intentions , perhaps partly because of the british difficulties .
it is not enough to speak of a confidence pact , president santer , because there is no confidence , there can be no confidence in a europe with 18 million unemployed .
i ask that to save the european union and relaunch it , so that together we can all avert the threat of real shipwreck .
like millions of people in europe i am sure , i share this wish .
i believe we all agree that all countries must have sound economic policies .
however , sound policy also means pursuing a policy which prevents social exclusion .
it is high time , madam president , to review this politically high-risk project which is creating social unrest and political tension in europe .
put emu on the agenda for the igc !
madam president , i listened with great interest to what mr santer and mr dini said to us here this morning .
both gentlemen highlighted the lack of progress to date at the igc negotiations .
while recognizing that the problems are very complex , they can only be solved by courageously taking the first decisions on the various items on the agenda .
the crisis of confidence in the member states will have to be overcome .
the negotiators will have to move into a higher gear if they are to reach successful conclusions .
as mr dini said , we in the european parliament are in the best position to reflect the concerns of our citizens .
i know that many items which people want tackled are high on our agenda but they are not being dealt with at the igc .
i want to lobby unashamedly for the european anti-poverty network .
a priority must be the fight against poverty and social exclusion and in particular the discouragement of the 18 million unemployed .
we are all very concerned about the impact on employment of the beef crisis .
but consider for a moment the plight of the millions of people in long-term unemployment and the many people who have never had a job and who struggle through life in dire poverty .
the fight against unemployment must be put on a par with attainment of emu .
we need to redress the balance between economic policies and social policies by providing for a social audit of all european union policies .
these must be guaranteed to all residents of the union without discrimination .
finally , the behaviour of the british government with regard to the beef crisis is unacceptable .
i fear that if beef is allowed to take over the florence summit it will augur very badly for a successful summit in dublin .
no prizes for guessing what the man in the street will have to say about that !
the negative attitudes towards europe which are already firmly rooted will flourish even more as a result .
three brief remarks , madam president .
on bse first .
i totally agree with mr santer that bse is a public health matter and must be resolved in a responsible manner .
i approve of the proposal which has now been put forward .
i hope the united kingdom will accept it .
but at the same time i must say the chances are that it will not .
in that event we should seriously consider having the other fourteen summit members simply take decisions without the united kingdom .
the united kingdom would then have to refer the legitimacy of those decisions to the court of justice .
as regards the igc , it has to be said really that little progress has been made .
the progress report we have now received says little more than last december 's westendorp report .
i think we need to indicate that it is important for something to be done .
we want our citizens to play more of a part .
we want more openness and transparency .
we want more democracy .
we want better arrangements for internal security and better results from our external policy .
these things have to happen .
parliamentary assent is needed to all these things .
one last remark .
the resolution now before us mentions yugoslavia .
we are very keen , and the resolution reflects this , to have an inquiry into srebrenica .
i would draw this passage to the attention of the italian presidency ; will they consider it carefully ?
only president dini has retained a fundamental role in the handover , moving from prime minister to minister of foreign affairs : his responsibilities on europe are quite undiminished .
so we look to president dini , and naturally to president santer , to guarantee the continuity of the work begun in turin .
as president dini reminded us this morning , turin has produced two main issues : administrative and fiscal deregulation and bureaucratic simplification .
these are essential conditions of economic recovery , above all for small and medium-sized firms , the real cogs in that recovery .
it is worth remembering that italy will not hold the presidency again for at least seven and a half years , and by that time europe will either be finally built or will not be built at all .
madam president , as the beef crisis continues so the british government 's still largely indiscriminate non-cooperation policy appears increasingly counter-productive .
there is simply no sense in blocking measures which , for example , prevent fraud , reduce red tape , promote minority languages and step up the fight against racism .
whatever happens with the beef ban , if the british government now disrupts the florence summit it would be an act of folly and stupidity .
with 18 million people without work in britain and throughout the european union it would be madness for the british government to block this proposal .
jobs must be the florence priority and nothing - absolutely nothing - should be allowed to distract us from this objective .
i want the beef ban to be lifted immediately but i also recognize that the british government must bring forward proposals which will command genuine consumer confidence .
the events of the past few weeks have undoubtedly harmed the european union and weakened britain 's standing and undermined her influence .
the florence summit has to be seen as an opportunity for a fresh start .
the onus is firmly on the british government to demonstrate that it is serious about constructive , european cooperation .
if a conservative government is not up to that task it should make way for a labour government which is .
madam president , the harrowing experience of the tragedy in yugoslavia has highlighted the absolute need for a common foreign policy and precisely targeted preventive diplomacy .
a lot is said about this vital need , but little is done .
the worst thing of all is that there is no mechanism for dealing with dangerous situations immediately they arise .
that is precisely what is missing now in the case of the aegean .
for some time , the behaviour of a country bordering on that sea has been generating intolerable tension in the region .
for some time , various reports have pointed to an imminent danger of a hot conflict .
however , turkey has been stirring up trouble even since imia . there have been threats of war , frenzied statements by ministers , brazen territorial claims and aspersions about the sovereignty of members of the union .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the escalation of the mad cow crisis shows how lies , economies with the truth and secrecy create a climate in which hatred , fear , xenophobia and suspicion can flourish .
it hardly needs saying that this may ultimately jeopardize the ratification of amendments to the treaty .
the intergovernmental conference must strip governments of the institutional instrument they might use to play this obstructionist game again in future .
the instrument they make use of , ladies and gentlemen , is the secrecy of their deliberations and the secrecy of voting in the council of ministers .
i thus call on the igc to address itself to the ending , once and for all , of secret voting in the council 's activities as legislator and generally speaking to the promotion of transparency .
madam president , three months after its official opening and despite the efforts of the italian presidency , the intergovernmental conference is at a standstill .
the first reason for this is the general lack of political impetus .
the problems to be solved by the conference are not technical but political .
only the ministers and heads of state and of government can provide the indispensable impetus .
they should become personally involved , which has not yet happened , if they wish the conference to make progress .
the second reason is the blocking by the british government .
the blocking of the conference started well before the ' mad cow ' crisis , but since it was expressed in a civil fashion the other member states could delay the moment of truth .
a fine result for mr major .
he isolates himself and shows by his attitude the vital importance of majority voting .
the european council in florence should lay down a few guidelines for the irish presidency so that the intergovernmental conference does not find itself in dublin at the same point as it is today .
our resolution details the priorities .
i shall deal with only four of them .
this parliament , i hope , will not approve a minimal reform .
nor will some national parliaments .
ambitious reforms are the only way .
madam president , last week the committee on regional policy met in brussels .
at that meeting , two austrian heads of provincial governments , who had entered into office as a result of democratic elections , could not be given formal accreditation owing to the british policy of non-cooperation .
hopefully this situation can be resolved at the summit in florence so as to make decision-making regarding both employment and the igc efficient .
not only economic growth but also co-operation between governments and employers ' organisations and trades unions is required in the fight against unemployment .
we have to be able to agree jointly on a policy which would channel economic growth into investments .
similarly productivity has to be improved and new means of work-sharing has to be found .
it should not be forgotten that we also need to invest in research and education in europe .
this initiative is to a large extent similar to parliament 's standpoint .
nato 's decision concerning the possibility of using nato forces in european operations also fits into the whole picture .
the common foreign and security policy should be made more efficient .
we should also ensure that countries not belonging to defensive alliances are given equal opportunities to participate in the forming and implementation of a common foreign and security policy .
in today 's europe non-alliance should not be seen as a way of avoiding responsibility , but could instead increase stability and security .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , there is an astonishing degree of agreement to the effect that as far as the third pillar is concerned , results have so far been unsatisfactory .
even the british government is entirely in agreement with this view , and this is contrary to many of our citizens ' expectations regarding european policy .
if we look for the reasons , the first thing that we find is the requirement that there should be unanimity in the decisions of the council of ministers .
if sovereignty leads to a situation in which the public are deprived of possible protection against crime , then i cannot imagine that sovereignty in that sense is supported by the will of the people .
therefore , in the context of the summit and the negotiations over the maastricht treaty , the concept of sovereignty must be examined under the microscope .
sovereignty is the basis of the nation state , and in the foreseeable future we shall no doubt need that as the organizational model for the purposes of performing public duties .
madam president , the florence summit and the intergovernmental conference are confronted with problems that show up certain weak spots .
i call upon the british government to give up its current obstreperous behaviour .
on all the subjects that are to be discussed , this summit is especially important , because an initial report is to be given on the results , to date , of the intergovernmental conference .
to sum up , i should just like to go over , briefly , the main points for discussion at the european council and the intergovernmental conference .
they are concerned with further institutional development , of deepening and broadening .
i support the present motion for a resolution .
particularly important are those developments that give the european parliament more weight .
they are also concerned with questions of security , and with universal services .
you may therefore declare that such a decision is valid and the recalcitrant wishing to contest this validity will have to prove it before the court of justice , and i wish him good luck .
i am astonished , mr president-in-office , that neither you nor the legion of legal advisers surrounding you have not yet thought of this solution .
this also goes for the president of the commission .
you are the guardian of the treaty and you cannot allow the solemn commitments embodied in article 5 of the treaty to be reduced to a useless scrap of paper in this way .
it is therefore your duty to act , and not only by threats , which are undoubtedly expressed with much conviction and i must acknowledge are well-directed , but are so far without effect .
since you have such means at your disposal , why not use them ?
madam president , we must hope that this does not simply turn into a council meeting about mad cow disease - florence is much too beautiful a city for that .
certainly it is an important question , especially as it has resulted in a political game which is only increasing the public 's mistrust of the union .
however , let us ensure that at least the other fourteen member states are prepared to accept their responsibilities .
mr dini said that it is important that the eu does not give the impression of being an artificial construction .
i agree with this .
we must show that we really can use the union to deal with the problems which concern the public .
this means employment and nothing else .
i am totally convinced that this is the common message from this house and the common message from the people of europe .
in this connection there are now a number of initiatives which can be taken up , from france , from sweden and now also the commission 's idea of a confidence pact .
i hope that mr dini will take the following message with him : take up all these initiatives and show that it is possible to achieve something concrete in florence .
finally , madam president , there is another area in which fine words must be given some substance .
this is the question of openness .
we must have a system of rules so that eu officials know what is required .
things should not be left to their discretion .
the basic rule must be that all documents which are received by or emanate from the eu institutions should be public .
it should be entirely possible to start this work while the current igc is in progress .
we do not need to wait for an igc lasting one and a half or two years ' to be over before instituting reforms in this area .
the confidence pact for employment in europe , as proposed by the commission , is absolutely essential , as are employment alliances at all levels .
that is social dialogue in action , and subsidiarity in action .
but subsidiarity also means that when the primary , smaller competent body cannot master the task alone , then the larger body must become increasingly active in a subsidiary capacity .
we need an agreement to release additional investments for trans-european networks , without increasing public duties as a whole .
we need to concentrate resources on investments that create jobs , including those in the eu structural funds .
however , there is no way that these resources should be taken out of " traditional ' social policy , i.e. chapter iii of the community budget .
on the contrary , other parts of the budget should be brought into play , parts in which there are unspent surpluses , for example , in the case of the funds as well .
the confidence pact favours greater flexibility , productivity-oriented wages and a reduction in costs accessory to wages .
madam president , mr president-in-office , mr president of the commission , we are aware of a sense of difficulty in the initial negotiations of the intergovernmental conference .
the resolution from the committee on institutional affairs emphasizes that .
it has not been and is not yet a case of making decisions , but of identifying a strategic vision at a transition stage in the life of the union .
the european process often moves forward in political fits and starts , not by always recording dissent .
in short the union needs a strategic vision , an answer to the question : what will europe be like at the end of the century .
that is the great question the intergovernmental conference must answer by making sure pressure towards renationalization driven by individual interests does not close down or blur the image of the common european good .
there must be recognition during the work of the conference that europe has no alternative to europe .
and in fact this is correct : the third pillar is concerned with a series of important areas of the policy of the european union , areas that are relevant to security .
but if we look at what the third pillar contains - and the president-in-office of the council also mentioned europol - then it seems that fulfilling the security needs of the citizens of europe is a sad story .
if the european union were a car , its bodywork would be that of a lamborghini , whereas its engine would be that of a cinquecento , and a spluttering one at that .
that is the major problem that hits us when we look at the europol convention .
the main problem is that as far as internal insecurity goes , progress is being made , whereas as far as internal security is concerned , europe is just not getting to the point .
and in this specific case mr herman has put his finger on the problem .
we really must succeed in fulfilling the needs of the population , and their expectations of the european union .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , european summits have to be concerned with fundamental issues , and in florence , the question is whether we say yes to the community , or yes to blackmail .
for ten years the tory government has said no to european social policy , and now it is saying no to the basic european consensus .
that really is the limit !
the character of europe as a mutually supportive community is now at stake .
oh yes , the european union is more , much more , than just a free trade zone , and membership is based on treaties and on trust .
as far as the present situation is concerned , this means that negotiations are needed on the subject of the bse crisis .
the principles of the eu and the health of its people , however , are not negotiable .
anyone observing how calmly the fourteen member states have accepted the british policy of obstruction will realize just how low our expectations of the london government 's willingness to cooperate have sunk .
if we no longer have any expectations , then the intergovernmental conference cannot possibly be successful either .
but if it is not successful , what future will there be for europe ?
the european union needs great britain , and great britain needs the european union .
the only solution to the present crisis must therefore be that great britain must stay , and the tory government will have to go !
have we learnt absolutely nothing ?
does the fact that those frontiers are long make it as if they do not exist ?
it is credibility that we are fighting for . exactly who gets hurt each time credibility is lost hardly matters .
here i would mention that the intergovernmental conference was not in fact expected to open during these six months .
so i emphasize the importance of the turin decision to get the conference going .
why is that so ?
because it defines the objectives for further negotiation , outlines the compromise solutions , contains the substantial structure of the changes to be made to the treaty .
these are also substantial steps forward to the achievement of monetary union .
on employment , the tripartite conference held in rome in the last few days indicated , amongst other things , how the method of cooperation between the social partners should be adopted at the european level .
this also needs to be emphasized as an important fact .
on the third pillar , the protocol for europol has been finalized during the last few months and we trust it can be agreed at florence .
progress has been made on issues relating to culture , work , audio-visual and television without frontiers .
on foreign affairs , i do not think anyone can deny the fundamental and constructive role that the european union has played in the bosnian peace process .
on the mediterranean , there have been five meetings at ministerial level to follow up the barcelona conference : on computer systems , culture , energy , industry and tourism .
finally , i have already highlighted the issues and problems affecting the transatlantic agenda , as well as the bangkok meeting of heads of state and of government .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , after the speech by the president-in-office of the council , mr dini , i could be very brief .
the strategy developed by the commission for the european council in florence is embraced by the overall strategy that i had the privilege of presenting to you myself , here , when the present commission was appointed .
as president dini repeated just now , this strategy aims at making europe a union closer to its citizens .
to do this , we must concern ourselves with the problems facing our citizens today .
these involve three aspects .
first , unemployment and jobs .
our citizens fail to understand why europe , with its huge internal market of 370 million inhabitants and 15 member states , is not succeeding in solving their daily problems .
we must therefore concern ourselves in the first place with the problem of unemployment and jobs .
this is therefore the direction to which we wish to commit ourselves in florence .
the second problem concerns what we call in community jargon the problem of the cfsp , the common foreign and security policy .
our citizens see daily on television a europe playing no part in world policies and world strategy .
our citizens want more europe not less europe in the areas of foreign policy and security .
this is what we should be focusing on more strongly during the intergovernmental conference .
i am very pleased that the presidency has put the question of external security on the agenda of the florence european council , particularly after the decisions just taken by the atlantic alliance at the berlin meeting .
they want europe to be playing a part in such matters and they want us to solve these problems in accordance with their own wishes .
citizens no longer understand .
if we wish to restore their confidence , we must be able to act so as to solve their particular problems .
there remains , clearly , the problem raised a short while ago which seems to be casting a shadow over the florence summit .
it has been , and will continue to be , guided in its actions solely by the necessity to protect the health of its citizens .
it is in this spirit alone that we have taken the decisions concerning beef derivatives subject to a number of conditions and restrictions .
of course , mr herman is undoubtedly right to ask why , as guardians of the treaty , we do not go to the court of justice .
we are facing a political problem .
chairman wilfried martens cited article 5 of the treaty .
i myself cited it before you on 5 june .
i am not giving up hope , and i say quite frankly that , in the next few days , a political solution will be found to a problem that is frustrating the working of our institutions .
we are committed to this . it is the role and duty of the commission to make proposals to this end based also on the request from the general affairs council .
if the situation can be unblocked in this way and a political solution achieved , then i hope we shall not need to resort to the extreme measure of appealing to the court of justice .
i thank president santer .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place in a moment .
votes
madam president , i would mention that this proposal was part of a price package for which i was rapporteur and was the only one not passed by this assembly .
as rapporteur let me say that there were very important reasons for that vote . it was a decisive ' no ' to the grubbing-up campaign which is gravely damaging european vineyards .
this will mean we also have an excellent opportunity to ask the agriculture council which is meeting next monday and tuesday to prepare a new document .
so i repeat , i ask that the vote against the extension of the current regulation be confirmed .
( parliament rejected the commission proposal )
the committee on agriculture and rural development has sent a clear message to the house .
if this is now confirmed , the commission will do its best to find a solution in this direction within the framework of the pricepackage discussions in the council .
i hope that that message will be received with generous acclamation by parliament .
a proposal to postpone the vote is put before our assembly .
does anyone wish to speak against ?
madam president , at the request of the rapporteur , we have just confirmed our opinion , which seems to me essential .
i am totally opposed to mr fantuzzi 's proposal , because in fact what we are in danger of passing is that the whole of the ' price package ' be called into question .
i therefore urge the leaders of the socialist group to think hard about the consequences of mr fantuzzi 's proposal .
if it is accepted , the council of ministers will be unable to adopt the ' agricultural price package ' next week because this regulation will not be included .
that is why , as the rapporteur mr santini has confirmed , parliament has held to its opinion .
our position on this remains as it was and i reject mr fantuzzi 's proposal .
madam president , just a second to reply to that statement .
this is about extending a regulation for a year without any consequences , except that obviously growers who grub up their vines would no longer receive rich premiums .
( parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
recital a refers to the political blackmail being used by the united kingdom ; and paragraph 3 also refers to the united kingdom .
i would also point out that the original french version of paragraph 3 refers to the need to ' induce ' the uk government to face up to its responsibilities .
the english version , however , uses the word ' compel ' .
mr medina , some of your points concern the language versions .
we take note of these .
there is then a proposal to add the word ' government ' .
madam president , i understand quite well the political reasons behind this request of the socialist group .
but if you look at the treaty and at point 3 , we should read article 5 of the treaty which says very clearly that member states shall take appropriate measures .
that means member states and we do not ask that from governments .
the reference made in this particular point to article 5 makes it impossible to accept that oral amendment .
madam president , i am solely putting forward what was the intention of the people who drafted the original text .
clearly there are linguistic problems in two areas which can be sorted out in the text .
but the other point concerns the clear intention when the compromise text was put together .
paragraph 3 does not reflect properly the intention of those who drafted the text .
mrs oomen-ruijten , since you are opposing this on behalf of your own group , we do not accept the oral amendment .
we shall not start a fresh debate .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
madam president , may i ask you for an answer concerning the legal status of amendments nos 8 to 11 ?
can i take it , since the matter is now being voted on by the plenary , that this view of the european commission is not deemed correct ?
i think it is important to be clear on this before we begin negotiations with the council .
i have asked the opinion of the presidency services , who do not share the opinion of the european commission , and i am therefore relying on the advice given to me .
( the president declared the common position approved as amended )
madam president , i should like to draw attention to a number of instances in which the different language versions of the amendments - in particular the spanish version - need to be brought into line .
in amendment no 5 , for example , the words ' doit obtenir ' in the original french version have been translated as ' debe permitirse ' , which is not the same thing .
with regard to the profession of lawyer , these are different concepts , i believe .
furthermore , in amendment no 25 to article 10 ( 5 ) , the word ' de ' is missing , altering the meaning .
madam president , in relation to amendment no 25 to article 10 ( 4 ) , there has been a specific request that the words used are ' public interest ' , not ' public order ' .
the words ' public order ' have no meaning in this context in english .
could you please confirm that this will be translated as ' public interest ' ?
madam president , i fully accept mrs mcintosh 's interpretation of the english version .
on the other hand , the french version must continue as ' ordre public ' .
this must be quite clear .
madam president , on this very important point , the french expressions ' ordre public ' and ' int&eacute;r&ecirc;t public ' in no way have the same meanings .
' int&eacute;r&ecirc;t public ' would mean that the state could make use in some way of a potestative clause to release itself quite unilaterally from the obligations of the directive .
the words ' ordre public ' presume a direct breach of the most fundamental laws of the state or possibly of its own security .
i believe it is extremely important to keep the words ' ordre public ' in the text .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
madam president , i should like to have the reaction of the european commission .
madam president , mr pimenta can anticipate the reaction of the commission since he well knows that , partly due to his effective efforts , these issues have received the most thorough attention .
parliament must make its decision on its choice of procedure and of course that is parliament 's privilege .
the commission cannot really add anything useful at this stage to that consideration .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
welcome
on your behalf , i would like to welcome a delegation from the tunisian chamber of representatives .
votes ( continuation )
madam president , in the motion for a resolution on broad economic guidelines there is at least one expression that is open to misunderstanding .
therefore i should like , on behalf of my group , to make an explanatory statement regarding this expression .
only if this is made clear are we prepared to agree to this resolution as it stands .
this sentence , as it stands in the text , means what it means , and anyone can think what they like about it , but that does not alter anything .
( parliament rejected the motion for a resolution )
each european council held at the beginning or end of a member state 's presidency of the union is always the time for the public expression of certain wishes after having passed judgement on several questions .
but may i be allowed to add this : let us stop shouting all over the place that our priority is the fight against unemployment in europe !
we have all understood this !
let us act !
talking is not enough . we must act and show the political will to put an end to rising unemployment and to bring it down .
we cannot continue to do nothing for the 19 million or so in europe who are still unemployed and creating a life of poverty for nearly 50 million .
this is the priority that the florence council should take on board , with a timetable and specific commitments .
secondly , what we need now is a political europe !
the intergovernmental conference provides the means to achieve this .
but with the way it is going today , there is a great need to hurry .
nothing has been established and nothing constructive has emerged from the first debates .
we are really looking at a debate among selfcentred experts , not to mention the stench from all the nationalists .
today , the igc is bogged down .
it too needs a strong statement of policy in florence .
in six months , it may be too late .
reconstruction of the treaties is essential to the establishment of the political europe that has long been hoped for and must be accompanied by a social europe .
thirdly , we cannot contemplate the florence council , carrying so many hopes and expectations , being put at risk by the mad cow crisis .
there is a real public health problem here and it should be quickly cleared up .
every precaution should be taken .
but i will not accept the adoption of blocking tactics , even blackmail , which imperil european construction , now at a turning point in its history .
i dare not imagine that some of us might be completely irresponsible .
where mistakes have been made , there must be redress .
the diplomatic terrorism being used is pointless !
may the igc move us forward in this matter .
the current obstructionist tactics of the british government are to be deplored .
the bse crisis was a direct consequence of its own political ineptitude and there was no justification for punishing the rest of the european union for its own mistakes .
hopefully the florence summit will bring an end to this unfortunate episode .
however , it must resolve it in a way that does not reward blackmail .
if blackmail tactics are seen to succeed on this occasion then a real danger exists that other member states would be tempted to apply similar tactics when it suits them .
in my opinion the european council summit in florence should discuss and take a decision on the following subjects :
it should also once again be stressed that the eu should stand for cooperation between sovereign states and that there must never be any move towards a superstate .
if in the future europe is to be a stable and peaceful continent where democracy and human freedoms and rights are honoured and established principles , any federal tendencies within the european union must be opposed .
i believe that this house is entirely prepared to offer the commission its firm support in the disputes that will be inevitable if the necessary corrections are made to our economic policy .
however , the condition attached to that support is that the commission itself must explicitly correct the objectives and clearly identify the problems that it faces .
only in this way can we really achieve a european employment pact , in the teeth , as it were , of the finance ministers ' rejection and of five or six more powerful member states .
at the end of the day , the fate of the european union will probably be decided by this issue of mass unemployment .
we call upon the commission to face up to its historic responsibilities , instead of continuing , with honeyed words , to pretend to be doing something .
at the last igc member state governments failed to convince the citizens of europe that the european union was relevant to their needs and had answers to their problems .
as a consequence the maastricht treaty was nearly rejected and the eu was catapulted into temporary crisis with the concept of european integration seriously undermined .
if the same mistakes are not to be repeated , this igc must focus on the primary concerns of the european public .
the obvious area for concerted action at the moment is devising policies to combat drug trafficking .
while i welcome the fact that the irish government has made this area one of the priorities of the irish presidency , i seriously question the commitment of our european partners .
this is evident in a number of ways .
the uk 's blocking of the ratification of the europol convention deprives the eu of one of its major weapons against the drug barons .
if the present igc in its revision of the treaties fails to remedy the situation then it could be heading for disaster and deservedly so .
if the european union fails to utilise its existing powers properly and to build on them then it does not deserve to be given increased powers .
barton recommendation
there are two proposals in this report which we do not agree with even though we voted for the report as a whole .
however , we believe that there must a limit somewhere .
nor is it sufficient to measure the average values in noise tests .
it is the peak noise values which are of interest as it is those which cause nuisance .
we have voted for the barton report , although we do not agree that issues concerning the noise made by motorcycles and the like should be dealt with at union level .
however , we regard the report as being less regulatory , less protectionist and less arbitrary than the council 's extreme common position .
in mrs van dijk 's statement yesterday , she gave the reasons for the position of the majority of the group .
the minority , however , on the basis of the same ecological and social objectives , came to a different conclusion .
why was this ?
we are working on the assumption that highly fundamental environmental objectives are best achieved by effective practices being changed and not by maximum limits set by the administrative authorities .
especially in areas where the active cooperation of many individual operators is necessary , the strategy of regulating environmental pollution by means of maximum limits is restricted by the willingness of those operators to organize their own cooperation .
with this in mind we support the demands of motorcyclists for workable compromises on maximum limits , with the simultaneous ending of illegal practices .
fontaine report
madam president , no profession is excluded from freedom of movement and freedom to practise within the community .
quite rightly our rapporteur has reminded us that this key principle is established by article 52 of the treaty of rome .
here , we have worked for decades to set up this freedom of movement .
i was myself a rapporteur on the free movement of midwives in 1969 , if my memory serves me well .
community legislation on the freedom of lawyers to practise has had the effect that almost one third of lawyers currently registered with the luxembourg bar are non-nationals .
the more so because lawyers in my country - which has no law faculty - are obliged to obtain their professional qualification in another country .
however , we do prescribe further training periods and examinations for them to master the specific features of luxembourg law , since there can be no question of favouring non- nationals over nationals as regards these additional tests .
in order to maintain the quality of services provided by lawyers , there can be no question of levelling down by abolishing the additional training periods and tests prescribed in luxembourg .
we are in favour of this report , which represents a step towards balanced regulations authorizing lawyers of one european union country to practise in other countries of this same union .
the present directive and the related report are arousing dismay and opposition among luxembourg lawyers .
dismay , because the commission 's approach is inconsistent .
luxembourg lawyers do not understand why the system introduced by directive 89 / 48 can no longer serve .
it has contributed to vast liberalization of the profession in luxembourg , where over 27 % of lawyers are foreigners .
at the same time , it has ensured that these lawyers , whether foreigners or nationals , offer the safeguards and knowledge needed to serve their clients on the spot .
our opposition to this new directive will therefore be understood .
i shall be told that clients will very quickly discover this .
true , but it is irresponsible to allow the market to operate as regulator of a profession which is , when all is said and done , of public interest .
a foreign lawyer who sets up in luxembourg with his home-country professional qualification may know nothing about the languages used in that country .
that is why i support the amendments tabled by the luxembourg members and am against mrs fontaine 's report .
like the french members of my group , i have voted against mrs fontaine 's report on the proposal for a directive on the rights of lawyers to practise .
there are already two directives on lawyers , that of 22 march 1977 regulating the provision of services and that of 23 december 1988 relating to the equivalence of degrees .
the new directive seeks to go further by wider liberalization of the conditions under which lawyers can practise in all european union countries .
however , lawyers cannot be compared with a marketed product .
neither is their profession comparable with that of banks and insurance , for example , for which it has been possible to harmonize the conditions for equivalence and practising without too much difficulty .
the law in each of our countries , on the other hand , has , and will retain in the future , its own specific features and peculiarities .
the conditions for admission to the profession of lawyer are not identical ; those for practising the profession of lawyer are even less so .
but there should also have been a provision that a lawyer so admitted to the profession of the host member state must use his home-country professional qualification alongside the professional qualification of the host member state .
consequently , i hope that when the council examines this directive , it will reconsider these very debatable proposals .
this is a good indication of the european union 's recognition of the linguistic diversity which enriches it .
the european parliament once again demonstrated that it does not want or is unable to understand the inherent special problems of the small countries of the community .
the socialist member , mr fayot , and i tabled an amendment reflecting the fears of the luxembourg legal authorities about the process of registering a foreign lawyer with the relevant bar , but this amendment was unfortunately rejected .
in other words , i maintain that in every country , including mine , the defence of a citizen should be fully guaranteed by legal assistance from persons properly qualified in the law of the member state in question .
now , it is established - and who will dare contradict me on this point ?
- that this qualified assistance is no longer guaranteed if a member state is deprived of the right and ability to judge and assess a lawyer 's knowledge of national law .
thus , administrative and constitutional law are essentially belgian in spirit whereas civil and commercial law are influenced by france and belgium .
tax law has its origins in german tax law and decisions , both administrative and those of courts , refer to german case law .
another difficulty lies in the fact that the grand duchy of luxembourg is a trilingual country , so that the question of languages is an essential one for a lawyer practising his profession in the grand duchy .
it should also be emphasized that very many community nationals holding foreign law degrees are currently keeping terms in luxembourg and are successfully taking examinations at the end of their training .
" to make new progress in the construction of a cultural europe ' ; that is how the rapporteur describes the size of the task that she had to cope with .
the content of the new directive may thus serve as a convincing example of the sensible application of the principle of subsidiarity .
the report itself is thus a testament not only to the diversity of european legal practice but also to a new , cooperative legal culture .
it deserves the full support of parliament .
( sv ) as opponents of the union it was with great satisfaction that we read a report which opposes the commission 's integrationist zeal .
madam president , i was glad to see parliament giving such tremendous support to mr pimenta 's report .
the debate on hunting and humane trapping methods has been both long and heated , within the eu and in the rest of the world .
as a result there are now 60 countries which have prohibited hunting using leghold traps .
of these , 22 countries have introduced the prohibition in the last five years .
this shows , among other things , that hunting can be carried out without the terrible leghold traps .
after all , i do not suppose that there is anyone here who believes that the lapps in sweden , for example , have stopped hunting because fox traps are prohibited .
in the eu the import ban should have entered into force on 1 january 1995 .
however , as a concession to the wishes of the major fur-exporting countries , particularly canada , its entry into force was postponed till 1 january 1996 - a most remarkable occurrence .
there is no legal instrument which would allow further postponement and something now has to happen .
it is with dismay that we now discover that despite this the commission is proposing amending the regulation in a way which will constitute a regression of a decade for the eu and all of us .
it is reasonable to ask why .
is it out of fear of countries such as the usa and canada ?
is it out of fear of the wto , or what ?
no matter what , it is to say the least deplorable and unworthy of an organisation which claims to represent a humane approach .
humane hunting methods and leghold trap regulations have become a symbol of the conflict between animal welfare , indigenous peoples , markets , trade and the environment .
an institutional question of principle has now also arisen here , namely , what happens when community legislation is undermined by , for example , the commission ?
unlike the commission , the green group in the eu parliament has not changed its standpoint and has not given in to pressure and has therefore supported the report .
when the commission appeared before us last december , we expressed our dissatisfaction at its failure to implement the ban on the import of pelts of certain wild animals caught by means of leghold traps .
and so ?
we trust that that will not be the case .
the danish social democrats in the european parliament are sceptical about this new regulation , since we do not think the commission is entitled , on its own initiative , to postpone legislation which has been adopted .
a dilemma arises for us in the vote on leghold traps , however .
on the one hand , there is no doubt that leghold traps are an inhumane trapping method , and that use of them should be eliminated .
it is therefore an excellent idea to ban imports of pelts from animals caught using leghold traps .
the best approach for all the parties concerned is to establish clear rules as soon as possible , so that any switch to other trapping methods can begin .
we therefore have to reject the attempts by the canadian government to delay an international agreement on humane trapping methods .
canada 's indigenous population has been used as an excuse for the canadian government 's inertia in the international negotiations on new trapping standards .
these delaying tactics have been emulated by the united states , amongst others .
if we vote against the regulation , it would be an acknowledgement of the forces which have worked against change .
i would like to express my support and that of the green group for the report by mr pimenta on trade in skins of animals caught in traps .
despite the fact that this issue has been discussed for years now , no agreement has been reached with canada and the united states so the commission 's proposal to remit this again cannot be accepted .
there must be a ban on imports of skins of animals caught in a cruel way , especially as the european union has already prohibited the use of traps on its own territory .
such a ban does not conflict with the gatt agreements , because the com regulation includes a clause protecting health , environment and ethical interests .
i support the pimenta report as i am angry that the commission has so far failed to implement the ban on importing furs from animals captured using leghold traps .
it is unacceptable that this ban is still not in force six months after it was due to be implemented .
many people in my own constituency are concerned about animal welfare issues - and rightly so .
if we want europe to be known as a civilized part of the world then we must act in a civilized way towards animals .
i hope the president 's proposed legal challenge to the court of justice over the commission 's failure to act is swift and successful .
jacob report
madam president , here is an animal health disaster .
damage has been done and must be put right .
one way of doing this was simple : it was that of responsibility , responsibility of the enterprise owned mr mudler - who is not a colleague of ours - of doncaster in yorkshire .
this way was not chosen .
what was chosen was solidarity , but solidarity also implied that there should be full compensation for the damage .
but what has the european commission decided ?
well , simply that we are going to compensate by a lump sum : ecu 650 million to be shared among 81 million cattle , which amounts to about ecu 8 per animal .
and effectively , provision is made for an additional subsidy of ecu 10 , that is 50-60 francs .
responsibility has been rejected in the name of solidarity and we end up with rapaciousness , mediocrity and accountancy .
this is where we are now , faced with a disaster for which the commission is partly to blame .
neither direct damage , indirect damage , immediate damage nor induced damage are being compensated for in full .
just now , we saw community law give way to un standards , now community law is giving way to the standards of natural law , which imply that those responsible should make amends .
madam president , i welcome the commission proposal to support the hard-pressed beef farmers throughout europe .
the reduction in beef consumption across europe has totally destroyed the market for beef and beef products .
this has placed many farmers in serious financial difficulty .
i understand the need to restore consumer confidence in the red-meat industry .
we must do everything possible to restore confidence throughout the industry once again .
i could not support the proposal of the committee on agriculture and rural development to reduce the level of support through the suckler cow and beef premium .
but , although the proposal is not perfect , it is at least a good attempt to help and to achieve a new beginning .
it will take a long time to recover from this crisis , but we must not ignore it .
in fact , as we move towards the autumn , the problems may well increase and develop to an even greater extent .
to subsidise a sector of production which is hit by a crisis in this way is not tenable in principle .
the european union cannot subsidise each sector of production hit by a fall in sales .
of course measures against bse must be taken , and these should include stopping the use of bonemeal in animal feed .
it is not therefore possible to vote for this report , even though we are of the opinion that forceful action must be taken to counter bse .
the current beef crisis is worse than anything that occurred in the past .
for example , in ireland alone it is estimated that the accumulative loss since the middle of march is in the region of &pound; 250 million .
the fall in prices will continue until we restore consumer confidence and an effective and comprehensive eradication policy is fundamental to achieving that .
the present proposed package is totally inadequate to meet the real losses incurred by farmers .
i would like parliament to support the proposal put forward by myself and colleagues to increase the package to ecu 1 , 000 million .
furthermore the situation should be kept under constant review .
a total of ecu 116 million of which ecu 9.5 million id proposed for ireland is a woefully inadequate proposal .
their losses have in fact been worse than those of the producers of male cattle and this must be recognized .
we are forced to say , however , that nothing of the sort has happened !
the vote taken today is highly significant : a reduction in additional aid ; suckler cows and young male cattle at ecu 10 per head instead of ecu 20 and 25 .
it is well known that only the interests of a certain number of countries are being satisfied , to the detriment of the general interests of the european union .
as a result , the interests of specialist breeders , who are of course those most affected by the current crisis , are neglected to the advantage of mixed and intensive cattle rearing .
was there complicity , thus taking advantage of the ignorance of cattle breeders and scapegoat consumers who , in every case , will pay for an affair for which they are in no way responsible ?
it is almost impossible at eu level to judge what support might be needed by individual meat producers in the member states of the eu because mad cow disease hits different producers and different countries so differently .
support should instead be decided at national level in accordance with local and regional circumstances .
broad economic guidelines
in this worsening situation , the commission merely plans to continue as before .
this assessment is undoubtedly partly true , particularly as regards reform of the job market , reduction of charges on the low paid and adaptation of the education system , including professional training , to market requirements .
but it must all the same be wondered whether a policy that fails constantly is not wrong somewhere .
our view is that the union is pursuing the broadly counter-productive objective of forced convergence , and that it is suffering from the absence of a genuine measure for international trade protection .
this amounts to tossing a coin over the question of the single currency coming into force .
for a reform of that importance , is this really responsible ?
however , we should ask ourselves why this has happened because there in fact are examples of brilliant economic success in europe .
norway and switzerland in the west , for example , or the czech republic and estonia in the east .
secondly , none of them is a member of the european union and is therefore not obliged to apply the deflationary policy of the convergence criteria .
history also teaches us that the centres of growth in europe were often small states or free cities particularly in italy or flanders , and not large artificially unified continental conglomerates .
referring to the national compromise and the edinburgh agreement , the danish social democrats naturally cannot support those elements of the resolution which run counter to denmark 's four reservations .
there is much that is good in the economic guidelines , for example the concentration on employment .
i have voted against as i am against emu .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
aid to former yugoslavia
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
mr president , we are beginning a debate on a number of reports dealing with aid and reconstruction in bosnia-herzegovina and the former yugoslavia .
the reports coming to us all the time are , i think , rather worrying .
various objectives of the dayton accords , such as freedom of movement , are turning out to be pie in the sky .
refugees are being allowed to return to their homes only after checks by the armies of the controlling ethnic groups .
thousands of refugees - there were new waves of refugees after dayton - and the croat and serb sides , but also the party of president izetbegovic , are contributing to a resurgence of ethnic cleansing .
of course , we can now say that there is peace and not war , which was not the case some months ago .
that is the basis on which the committee on foreign affairs gave unanimous approval to the report that i am presenting .
i would like to emphasize a few main points .
firstly to say that the humanitarian aid should be viewed as a link , as a bridge , to the policy for reconstruction overall .
however , i should like to draw the house 's attention to a number of points which i believe to be very important .
firstly , it should not be forgotten that the dayton agreements have been signed - and signed in their totality - and must be complied with in both their letter and spirit .
in this context , i think it is important to highlight a number of points .
given the differing degrees of complexity of the two aspects and their treatment in the dayton agreements , this is a generalization which we cannot accept .
we must do away completely with the impression that what the americans are doing is working and what the europeans are doing is not .
however , it is true that the implementation of many of the civil provisions of the peace plan is facing serious problems .
only small numbers of refugees have been able to return home , and then usually to territories in which their ethnic or religious group is in the majority .
karadzic continues openly and directly to pull the strings of the government of the republika srpska , and there are considerable doubts that he will be arrested before the elections .
i shall end by saying that in terms of actual reconstruction , the results of the european union 's action can be seen in mostar , although there are serious political problems , such as the lack of reunification .
however , physical reconstruction can be seen in mostar .
it is not visible in the rest of bosnia .
first , the origins .
for five years , the europeans , who love justice and freedom , watched sadly and in dismay something which the rest of the world saw as an illustration of the powerlessness of europe .
this pax atlantica - there is no other possible expression - since 54 , 220 of the soldiers come from 15 countries of the atlantic alliance - is now accompanied by a plan for reconstruction .
these are the financial and political implications of the peace we are discussing today .
our assembly should therefore now take formal note , by a vote that we hope will be in favour , of its involvement in the process of funding reconstruction .
this second conference had been preceded by a trialogue under the responsibility , for our assembly , of mr samland , during which a broad convergence of views with the council and commission emerged .
this positive action demonstrated that in this matter the council , the commission and the second branch of the budgetary authority shared the same objectives .
the committee on budgets unanimously pronounced itself in favour of the alavanos report on humanitarian aid .
as regards mr mendiluce 's report , the committee on budgets has also expressed a favourable opinion for the same reasons as those stated concerning the titley report .
turning to the report entrusted to me by the committee on budgets , i wish firstly to draw my colleagues ' attention to the importance of the contribution from the european union .
i remind you that in december we approved a sum of ecu 400 million programmed as shown in the table on page 14 .
the committee on budgets now proposes to you that we confirm the commission proposal to release ecu 600 million from the phare programme for the period 1996-1999 .
the table on page 12 also shows the proposed breakdown for democratization , sanctions , antipersonnel mines and the city of mostar , the gordian knot and focus of all the difficulties experienced by that unhappy country .
the arrival the day before yesterday of these draft regulations proposed by the commission nullifies point k in the preamble of my report .
this is a minor comment , but i now wish to make a major comment .
yesterday morning , i was opposed to urgent examination of this document .
a few more days reflection will therefore be useful for a careful examination .
to conclude and to get away a little from figures , i should like to mention a quotation .
the president of france declared recently : ' recent history has provided europeans with a good illustration , in bosnia , of their present opportunities and limitations .
on the positive side is the franco-british military cooperation and the german decision , taken at the prompting of chancellor kohl , to participate in external peacekeeping operations .
on the negative side is the present inability of europeans to engage in a large-scale politico-military action on their own responsibility .
we must put an end to what is perceived by the world as european powerlessness .
we must build our common european defence policy , to which we are committed by the maastricht treaty ' .
i will add for my part that our assembly must also participate in this .
by adopting these four reports which in fact form only a single one , our assembly will play its full part .
we have often been criticised for being inclined to discuss matters of little importance .
this time , make no mistake , this is a major report and , by approving it , you are preparing yourselves to take a major political act .
mr president , we should all be clear that there is no peace in bosnia at the moment in any sense in which the ordinary person would understand that word .
there is very little sense of reconciliation , there is virtually no freedom of movement and few refugees have been able to return home .
instead , international military force has merely brought about a halt in hostilities .
it has provided us with a very small window of opportunity to show the local population that they have a stake , both politically and economically , in the future .
they will get a political stake when elections are held and , despite all the difficulties , it is vital that these elections go ahead on schedule .
the economic state will depend on the success of the international reconstruction effort , which is the area my report deals with .
secondly , the basic structures of society were missing .
government institutions have had to be built up from scratch .
thirdly , economic reconstruction is not the same as humanitarian aid .
reconstruction involves careful planning , extensive consultation and the implementation of long-term financial management .
it therefore takes longer to produce results and requires patience .
given these and many other difficulties , the reconstruction effort mounted so far by the international community has been remarkable .
the commission in particular has achieved a great deal , particularly in mostar .
therefore , the concerns i am about to outline should be seen in that context .
there have been two major international donor conferences which have jointly raised us $ 1.8 bn .
that amount contrasts , of course , with the us $ 7 bn which the ifor operation is costing .
it is also a misleading figure .
in making their pledges governments have sometimes juggled the figures .
the real amount is less than us $ 1.8 bn , which has caused some of the reconstruction projects to be scaled down .
further , the money has been very slow to materialize .
in april only half of the money pledged at the december conference had actually been committed .
the burden of reconstruction money has not been shared out as fairly as originally intended .
the eu is still responsible for more than its fair share .
that is why i call in my report for other donors , particularly the united states , japan and the islamic countries , to make a greater commitment .
donors have mainly put money into specific projects or given assistance in kind .
too little money has gone into other areas .
funding for recurrent expenditure is desperately needed .
rebuilt schools and hospitals are of little use if there is nobody to pay the salaries of teachers and doctors .
money needs to be channelled into the social sector , both to provide shortterm employment and to fund a basic social security safety net .
another essential area being underfunded is land-mine clearance .
there are more land-mines in bosnia than people .
economic life cannot return to normal if people literally cannot walk in their back garden for fear of landmines .
but only 2 % of the money committed in the first donor conference has gone on land-mine clearance .
finally , we must constantly emphasize the importance of housing reconstruction . without that normality cannot return .
when i was in bosnia , criticisms were made that the commission was releasing money too slowly .
given the difficult circumstances the commission operates under and the need to ensure financial probity and full transparency , these criticisms are largely unfair .
there is a desperate need , however , for small sums of money to be rapidly disbursed .
i hope we can do something in that respect in the future .
it is also essential to make it clear that there is no weakening of our determination to make our assistance conditional on respect for the dayton agreement and particularly respect for human rights .
we must also ensure that there is effective coordination of the international aid effort .
we have heard a number of stories of failed coordination which has hampered the effectiveness of that aid .
finally , the international community has done much , but has actually talked a lot more .
if we are to build a real and lasting peace in bosnia , then the international community must put its money where its mouth is .
mr president , following the signing of the dayton agreements , peace at last seemed possible in the wartorn territories of former yugoslavia .
however , peace is not won ; only wars are won .
peace is built .
hence the urgency of carrying out the moral reconstruction of former yugoslavia and the need for measures which help to establish a just order , based on respect for democracy and human rights .
this is not an easy task .
the pain and humiliation of those who suffered the indignity of ethnic cleansing is too great .
the scars left by the violence and hatred are too deep : 200 000 dead , more than four million refugees and displaced persons , cities reduced to rubble , and a traumatized civilian population .
in this way , peace will start to become a reality in bosnia-herzegovina .
the european union , which was incapable of stopping the war , now has it in its hands to make peace possible .
this is the european union 's great responsibility , and indeed our responsibility .
mr president , in the debate on former yugoslavia i should like , as joint draftsman , to focus on mr alvanos 's report on humanitarian aid to this war-torn region .
very few people are aware that the european union is far and away the biggest donor of humanitarian aid to the countries of former yugoslavia .
since 1992 the union has provided 1.6 billion ecu , and this region thus takes more out of the echo aid fund than all other regions put together .
i must stress here the respect i feel for all those working with the ngos , who often have to operate under difficult conditions and sometimes at considerable risk to their own lives .
against that background , mr president , i have a few comments which you will also find in my opinion and which have been very largely adopted by the committee on foreign affairs .
we believe a clear distinction needs to be made between humanitarian aid and aid to reconstruction .
aid to reconstruction is not emergency aid .
humanitarian aid is given without political strings attached and aid for reconstruction does have political strings .
we think these two flows of aid must be kept separate because otherwise humanitarian aid , which is in any case all too meagre , will be misused for projects which are really part of the reconstruction effort .
we have put down a number of amendments on this and are glad that the committee on foreign affairs has endorsed them .
perhaps a little more can be done here under echo .
thirdly , help is also needed in the social and cultural field , because multicultural organizations need to be able to regenerate themselves .
it must also be possible to counter the segregation which increasingly threatens to become established in schools and hospitals , but help is needed for that .
and we believe such help has to be given .
and then there are the soldiers being demobilized , mr president .
there are some 300 000 of them and we hear that they are increasingly forming gangs and thus creating a new danger .
it is said that there are 3 to 4 million mines in the region . we think humanitarian aid money can be used here if there is no other way of paying for mines clearance .
a couple of remarks to close with , mr president . we think it is most important for the return of refugees to be properly coordinated .
we are genuinely concerned that too many of them will be forcibly repatriated .
we urge the commission to be particularly alert to this possibility . finally , mr president , one political question : what is actually going to happen when the united states withdraws from the entire region ?
can we then expect the european union to fill the gap ?
is there any truth in the rumour that mr bildt too will be resigning at the end of the year ?
can the commissioner give specific answers to these questions ?
have not we repeatedly emphasized in recent months just how important the civil reconstruction of the country is , so as to raise people 's hopes for peace in good time before the elections in september ?
with a great show of strength , we made over ecu 200 million available , and we insisted on unbureaucratic and rapid aid .
and what happened ?
six months later , most of the emergency relief that was made available has still not arrived .
it has become tangled up in the commission 's bureaucratic jungle and in its bickering over who is responsible for what .
right from the beginning , parliament indicated that the phare programme was not suitable for bosniaherzegovina .
i was able to verify at first hand the fact that long deadlines for tendering , and central planning via the government , are not at all appropriate for this particular situation .
and what about the ecu 92 million of emergency relief that parliament made available under separate budget headings ?
we called it , " europe for sarajevo ' .
but unfortunately sarajevo has received almost nothing from europe , with the exception of constantly changing faces .
the commission has put these funds on ice , saying that there is no legal basis for them .
at the end of may it submitted the draft to the council and parliament for advice .
if we are lucky , implementation may start in august , in other words a month before the elections .
the political repercussions , for which you , commissioner van den broek , share the responsibility , are most unfortunate .
people will not see any recognizable sign of hope if they cannot repair their houses .
the return of refugees will not be possible , because there are no houses or jobs in sight .
mr van den broek , the former yugoslavia is not going to do us a favour by organizing itself neatly and tidily on the basis of phare and humanitarian aid .
this is a country that has largely been destroyed , and its people are without hope .
one glance at mostar could have shown you what needed to be done , in other words , to organize decentralized assistance using qualified staff .
in mostar , reconstruction is proceeding hand in hand with the creation of new infrastructures , and 90 % of all projects are being carried out by local firms .
this approach also makes it possible , to some extent , to walk the difficult political tightrope between aid and conditionality .
but what should be done now ?
commissioner , it is high time you took on full responsibility for this matter !
set up a proper team in brussels , made up of people who will work together and not against one another !
link the phare programme aid to the emergency aid !
do not create two mutually independent procurement structures !
learn from the experience gained in mostar !
develop decentralized programmes , place more reliance on the local mayor rather than on a deposed government in sarajevo , and get your priorities right !
encourage the formation of local infrastructures instead of looking for orders for eu companies and jobs for eu advisers !
send qualified personnel to the most important towns , and above all make use of the time leading up to the elections !
support the independent media , and help the opposition to make its voice heard !
in other words , finally get round to doing what parliament instructed you to do at the end of last year , when it took the relevant budget decision !
and now for a reaction to the council .
it seems to me , mr fassino , that there is considerable uncertainty within the council as to how it can be made possible for refugees to return to their homes .
however , as we know , this is something that cannot be achieved quite so quickly .
it is therefore essential to ensure that the rehoming of refugees does not itself give rise to further misery .
we should therefore follow the recommendation of the mayor of tuzla , who is insisting that first of all the one million or so refugees that were uprooted within bosnia should be given the chance of relocating .
only then should a full-scale start be made on rehoming the one million or so refugees who have found shelter abroad .
this gradual process would also make it possible to resolve many of the outstanding property disputes dating from the days of socialism .
it is precisely because the refugee issue is so closely linked to rapid reconstruction that our delay in getting the emergency aid scheme off the ground is particularly unfortunate .
in this context it seems to me that the regulation adopted by the council is highly disturbing , in that it succeeds in turning the emergency aid into a creeping subsidy programme for spanish and other suppliers .
mr president , we have held countless debates in this house and adopted numerous resolutions on the tragedy of the war in former yugoslavia .
little has been left standing ; the destruction is continuing , and time is short for peace to be secured .
in this debate today , we are determined to establish reasonable criteria for reconstruction of the areas which have suffered the severest damage as a result of the conflict .
former yugoslavia is on our borders , and this means that the union must make a great effort , even if critical voices are raised - and they will be heard .
it is worth committing ourselves to the establishment of a plan for peace , harmony and cultural tolerance .
intolerance and hatred are scourges which must be combatted with solidarity .
and solidarity , let us not forget , is a duty which cannot be replaced by goodwill or charity .
in other words , success will depend on a number of factors , but above all on a distinct financial effort .
it can never be stressed enough that the peace is fragile .
the region - above all bosnia-herzegovina - is shattered , its industrial fabric destroyed and its productive capacity reduced to nil .
so it is essential to lay the foundations for reconstruction without delay , thinking in both the medium and long term .
and achieving peace will depend on the process of democratization as well as on the economic effort .
unfortunately , the transition to a market economy - a precondition for this contractual development - will be taking place in the worst possible conditions .
as a result , the union 's financial instruments must be well defined and match the realities .
mr president , six months ago the peace negotiations in bosnia-herzegovina ended with the signing of the dayton accord .
since then , the international community has made great efforts to achieve longterm peace in this devastated country , by means of reconstruction .
the european union and its member states have fulfilled their responsibilities with regard to a substantial part of these efforts , in terms of both reconstruction and peacekeeping by the ifor troops .
however , we have not yet succeeded in ensuring peace .
after a certain amount of initial difficulty , the first results of the reconstruction effort are now visible , and even the restoration of infrastructural facilities is slowly but surely progressing .
thanks to the presence of the international troops , however , the most important objective has been achieved .
the war has ended . this does not mean that all the wounds in the relationships between the individual ethnic groups have already been healed , and that peace is guaranteed in the long term .
but thanks to ifor the people of bosnia-herzegovina can now venture to make a new start in relative safety .
unfortunately the situation is still not such as to make this possible without the presence of the ifor troops .
the planned withdrawal of ifor forces at the end of this year is therefore likely , in my opinion , to constitute the greatest threat to maintaining both the peace and the reconstruction process .
mrs maij-weggen has spoken about this problem .
i take exactly the same view as she does .
the matter must be discussed .
a decision of this kind is essential , because without ifor we cannot expect the peace process to be successful .
all those who have said so here today are right , because although progress is being made on reconstruction , there is still a lot of work to be done .
as was shown by last week 's follow-up conference in florence , on the implementation of the peace accord , there are some areas in which a lot of work still has to be done .
the implementation of free and democratic elections could make an important contribution here , if - and i emphasize the word " if ' - the basic conditions for those elections can be provided .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , it is now almost seven months since dayton or paris , and we have to ask ourselves whether anything has really changed .
the only thing that has changed is that there is no longer a war going on , but the changes have not been as great as we should have liked .
on the civilian side , things are not yet progressing as we had thought they might .
we are coming up against a lot of obstacles , including the fact that in this instance war has paid off , since the aggressor has gained 49 % .
it is also true to say that ethnic cleansing is still going on everywhere in bosnia . over the last four years we have learned that ethnic cleansing still goes unpunished .
it is now continuing in all regions , and we cannot prevent it , despite the many organizations that are there on the spot .
we are forced to admit that local politicians and police officers are still compliantly doing the dirty work for their criminal bosses .
of course there are decent politicians everywhere , and those who would like to make these things public , but who dare not , because if they did they would very soon lose their heads .
so the civilian implementation is not working , but the reason it is not working is that it is mainly europeans who are involved .
at the end of the day , everybody agreed to this civilian implementation , and everybody is responsible for it , just as we are also all responsible for the positive results of the military implementation .
as far as humanitarian aid and reconstruction aid are concerned , we are faced with the question of how to give our aid , whom to give it to and on what conditions .
if we were to follow our own ideas , then we would be able to give aid to hardly any projects at all , because hardly anywhere are the provisions of the dayton accord being observed .
the extradition of the war criminals is being boycotted .
freedom of movement has not been established .
only a tiny number of refugees have returned from the serbian sector of bosnia into the croatian-moslem sector .
the authorities in the serbian sector have absolutely no interest in having their fellow serbian citizens coming back to sarajevo , for example , which in many cases they went away from as a result of serbian pressure .
nor have they any interest - although they maintain that the opposite is true - in seeing them go back into krajina , thereby forcing the croatian authorities to show their true colours .
the reciprocity scheme is working wonderfully well , except that the serbs are to some extent preventing their own fellow citizens , who would very much like to return to their original homes , from doing so .
in other words , not much is happening .
yet the people of the country want peace !
they need , at long last , to have leaders who want the same thing , and the new elections could bring this about , at least in part .
this message must be got across , every day , morning , noon and night , by television and radio , so that the people - and in particular their politicians - finally understand it .
our aid must be concerned with the media projects .
it is a matter of the utmost urgency that we should rebuild houses and that we should rebuild multi-ethnic schools .
but it is also necessary to provide aid to build up the smes , thereby providing the possibility of help by self-help .
jobs are absolutely essential in order to give people prospects and in order to make them immune to the inflammatory speeches of their leaders , some of whom are criminals .
another substantial difficulty resides in the inappropriate handling of funds and their inadequacy , with negative consequences both on the quality and size of the programmes and on the timing of their implementation . time is a pressing factor .
such a measure would demonstrate acceptance of responsibility and raise the political visibility of the european commitment at the same time .
in terms of security , the deployment of the international police forces justifies considerable perplexity .
mr president , previous speakers have rightly expressed our fears in respect of war and peace .
the mid-term review of the dayton agreement conducted in florence expressed those same fears for the peace process .
in view of the time i shall confine myself to a few brief points .
the setting of a date for elections is interesting but it is not enough unless the international community is prepared to give its backing and help ensure that the elections are truly democratic .
ifor must help to secure the arrest of mr karadzic and mr mladic and the return of the refugees .
the union and other donors must help with the development of independent media , and i would echo here a call which a number of people have already made to the commissioner in other contexts .
we are already hearing that some people , namely foreign journalists , are experiencing problems , are being harassed and hampered in their work .
free media , in the context of the elections , will go a long way towards fostering the democratic perception that one 's voice is heard and can be heard .
mr president , i should like first of all to compliment mr alavanos and the other rapporteurs on their reports .
mr president , i do not want to go into detail about what has happened in the blood-soaked former yugoslavia over all these years .
i just wish to say that on numerous occasions there has been no shortage of hypocrisy in the european union , and no shortage of it here , too , in the european parliament .
i also believe that the european union bears a huge responsibility for the tragedy that the peoples of the former yugoslavia have had to live through , and still are living through .
the main foci of the aid must be :
the dayton peace was imposed by weapons , by force .
so , of course , it is not real peace .
the crisis and the hatred created by the war have not been overcome .
any attempt to impose conditions , or any unfair treatment in the management of the aid , could re-ignite the flames of war .
posterity will judge whether the european union shouldered its responsibility and implemented a good policy .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the peace process in former yugoslavia and more particularly in bosnia-hercegovina does indeed continue to be very hard going .
to my mind there are two factors which might have a very negative effect in the short and medium term .
the first is the lifting of the arms embargo yesterday and the second is the possibility - i hope it will be no more than that - that the elections planned for the autumn will fail .
the dayton agreement stipulated that the state of bosnia-hercegovina should not initially have its own army and its own police force , which would of course normally be an essential part of the state apparatus .
everyone know this and it is also visible on the ground .
on the other hand all the parties , including the opposition , think that it is better to hold the elections than not to .
mr president , peace has returned to bosnia-herzegovina .
at least the guns are silent .
two hundred thousand soldiers , or a few more , have returned to barracks , with ordered arms .
today , the worry is that everything , or nearly everything , remains to be done .
we must , at least for the time being , go into mourning - but mourning is by its very nature temporary - for a dream long kept alive of a multiethnic , multicultural and multireligious society .
make no mistake , the rapists and murderers have won the game .
i am not saying they have won the war , but they have won an important battle .
each of the now peaceful zones is controlled by an exclusive , or at the very least a largely dominant , ethnic group .
try to go from one town to another in bosnia .
it is practically impossible .
try to telephone from tuzla to banja luka , it is also virtually impossible .
these minimum freedoms of movement and communication are still non-existent .
the people in control of these adjacent enclaves care little for their citizens ' freedoms , including freedom of expression and freedom of the press .
but the european union does have enough weight to induce these authorities to respect , however minimally , the freedom of the citizens living in the zones they control .
we have the means , you have the means , to set clear conditions for establishing cooperation , particularly of a financial nature .
such a military presence , which is supposed to prevent any resumption of the armed conflict , should also enable these populations to regain confidence and to start rebuilding their own future .
whilst the dayton agreement offers a basis for peace , given the continuation of divisions along ethnic lines the question remains whether bosnia can ever become a multiethnic unified state .
we cannot see an enforced balance of power and peace agreement achieving this .
nevertheless the international aid we are discussing today is the appropriate instrument for encouraging a return to normal society in former yugoslavia .
in addition to humanitarian aid in the form of food supplies and medical care amongst other things , the focus must switch in future to reconstruction aid , with a view to selfsufficiency .
it is primarily important that tangible results should be achieved ahead of this autumn 's elections .
it is not easy to pick out priorities from the wide range of projects . but we would give precedence to those projects likely to encourage cooperation between the different population groups in former yugoslavia .
high priority should also be given to demobilizing the 300 000 or so troops and finding these people employment .
one question which does not receive sufficient attention is how far the union can help to reduce the number of weapons in the region .
i fear that peace will not be helped merely by stabilizing existing arms levels .
i would be glad to hear the commissioner 's views on this .
lastly , in giving aid for reconstruction the point is not so much that the union should prove its credibility in terms of its foreign and security policy , as we read in one of the reports .
the point is primarily that the union and the international community should , in providing aid , fulfil their moral obligations towards the citizens of war-torn former yugoslavia in the hope of establishing a lasting peace here .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the alavanos , mendiluce and titley reports submitted to us on humanitarian aid and reconstruction in the countries of the former yugoslavia are unsatisfactory .
only that of our colleague , mr giansily , has the strict budgetary qualities that we are pleased to acknowledge .
as for that of mr alavanos , the greek communist , it repeats the intentions of the council and commission concerning humanitarian aid , but accompanies them with unacceptable conditions connected with his ideological views .
in 1991 , mr alavanos , like mr delors , opposed the independence of the slovenian and croatian peoples , who were unanimous in their wish to recover their freedom and sovereignty .
this attitude is known to have been regarded as significant support by the rulers of the communist regime of the communist-serb army .
it is hard to understand why mr alavanos , who praises a unitary , multinational , multicultural yugoslavia , does not extend his argument to his own country .
why should he not advocate a greco-turkish or turko-greek society , which would end the age-old conflict between two neighbouring nations ?
the two other reports are also marred by such ideological attitudes .
what madness that is , when the same causes produce the same effects !
the important thing is to prevent for the muslim population of bosnia the palestinization that threatens them .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as we all know , europe failed to prevent the conflict in former yugoslavia , has failed to end the conflict in former yugoslavia .
it must now be a point of honour for europe to take the lead in providing fast , efficient and generous assistance to do as much as it can to rebuild former yugoslavia , and bosnia-hercegovina in particular .
there are , of course , a number of strings attached .
firstly , the dayton agreement must be implemented in full .
i think the frame of this debate is clear .
everyone understands that structurally important problems remain given the lack of a true desire for peace on the part of all the parties concerned .
so there is by no means any de facto implementation of the dayton agreement .
the elections have already been postponed and questions remain as to whether the autumn elections will be a success .
i thus believe special concern should be shown for eastern slavonia .
a second proviso which we , and primarily the committee on budgets , would impose is that there should be maximum transparency in respect of monies earmarked and strict monitoring of the way in which financial resources are spent .
in concrete terms that means that the european parliament wishes to be and to remain fully involved in the specific reconstruction effort .
it is important here that our committee on budgets and committee on budgetary control should play a major part .
urgency , regular urgent procedures of the kind we have seen for the transfers of appropriations we have already approved , are no longer democratically acceptable to this parliament .
today we have yet another financial regulation .
yet again urgency is requested .
we need to think carefully about how , through the budget , we can make sure that on the one hand aid is given efficiently and quickly enough but on the other hand that it is transparent enough .
in concluding , may i say that i was impressed by mrs m&uuml;ller 's report on the slow pace at which funds are released .
we have to cut through this red tape , at least as far as the future deployment of aid is concerned .
mr president , at the beginning of this debate we heard once again about the ineptitude and failure of the outside world and the european union to deal with the problems of former yugoslavia .
we are not totally happy with it .
nevertheless , they are separated .
my first question to the council is whether there is still any prospect of an international police force , which would also have to be well equipped .
we cannot plonk london bobbies down in banja luka and environs , or in sarajevo and environs .
that is just not feasible .
you need troops there who are more akin to riot police or our dutch military police , a force which can if necessary call on armoured vehicles .
in bosnia we are regularly dealing with armed gangs .
is there any prospect of this police force becoming a reality and of operating effectively ?
concerning elections , i must also ask the commissioner how things stand with regard to our help for a free media .
we know that the conflict in yugoslavia just as in rwanda and burundi , for example , is very largely the result of misuse and manipulation of the media .
we have been talking about this for years and there is still no prospect of effective opinion-forming by truly free media supported by us .
i think that is needed as a start to the healing process .
mr president , i particularly welcome the acceptance today in another report of the need for an international public inquiry into the political events surrounding the fall of srebrenica .
i think that certain countries are not so keen on this , any more than they want to see the arrest of karadzic and mladic , perhaps because too many awkward facts may come to light .
i think it is important that parliament , as the elected voice of europe , should have asked for this .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , first i would like to congratulate mr mendiluce and mr giansily on their excellent work .
the reconstruction of former yugoslavia and assistance to the people shattered by the war cannot leave out of consideration the peace process which opened in december 1995 with the ratification of the dayton agreements .
the european union has taken responsibility for 65 % of the humanitarian aid and for organizing the donor meetings on the reconstruction of the country .
a rapid and decisive start to the reconstruction of the economic and social fabric of former yugoslavia will constitute a first step towards stability and thus towards improving people 's lives .
this is the essential condition for restoring normality to the country . the aid must make it possible to move progressively from the emergency phase to the reconstruction phase .
the international conference of ministers in florence on 13 and 14 june - known as the mid-term conference - has taken place halfway through the peace process .
these elections must take place in maximum calm , with action taken to bring war criminals to justice .
the words peace , security , freedom , respect for human rights , democracy and justice must grow in significance in this region after years of martyrdom .
there must be political balance in television programmes to guarantee freedom of expression and put out accurate messages before the vote .
mr president , it is good to hear from colleagues who have visited the former yugoslavia that the situation there has improved .
this underlines the value of our support both for ifor and for the reconstruction which is being managed so well by carl bildt .
both inside and outside the eu there are many who regard developments in the former yugoslavia as a test of the european union 's foreign policy strength .
this makes positive results all the more important .
to achieve them money is needed ; the aid conference was successful but more is needed .
in this connection i should just like to emphasise that the phare programme , which is regarded as a milch cow , is not inexhaustible and has many , many calves to satisfy .
eu support should primarily go to power supplies , communications and homes and to revive the industry which has been destroyed .
for liberals it is especially important that no eu aid should be given to those who refuse to respect human rights .
allow me , mr president , to take this opportunity to express my estimation of the great efforts being made by our colleague elisabeth rehn .
nor should aid money be given to those who do not show by their deeds that they have understood the necessity of suspected war criminals being brought to trial .
those responsible for ethnic cleansing must be removed , refugees must return home , independent media must be established once again and free elections must be held .
we must construct a solid post-96 structure for bosnia-herzegovina .
mr president , now that it has been decided to have the elections in bosnia held on schedule it is important to look at how the rest of the peace process is going .
without lasting guarantees of security in bosnia and without visible success in reconstruction , the elections will be taking place in a kind of social vacuum .
they will then at best confirm the existing political balance in bosnia , which is not as good as it might be and will only improve once the peace process brings very clear benefits , at least there .
so it is also necessary to establish very quickly whether the international presence in bosnia , so fundamental to any reconstruction effort , is to continue .
one can doubt whether the date chosen for the elections is the right one . is there anything for people to vote on ?
will the conditions be right in september ?
we also believe that the union should seek together with other donors to speed up the visible reconstruction of bosnia .
a lot of talking goes on , a lot of planning goes on , but people see very little by way of concrete results .
more money must be freed up , procedures must be less complicated , more local people must be involved and materials and equipment must be delivered faster .
people in bosnia must be shown that things are changing and that they themselves can do something to further the process .
i think the european commission should also ensure that its offices in bosnia are adequately equipped and suitably staffed to carry out their work efficiently and fast .
in this context i would also emphasize the need for better coordination between the international organizations on the ground .
rapporteur titley rightly points to the slow pace at which aid funds pledged are released .
that point too merits attention .
if the international community wants the political process to continue according to plan it will at least need to be quicker than it is now to invest in creating a material basis for political progress .
in that respect the elections are important .
ifor 's role in the peace process is important but visible renewal , visible results of reconstruction are equally important to the success of the huge operation which the international community has set in train in bosnia .
but we must be careful !
accusations will not help those people out there who are now waiting for help . they need economic aid , but they also need psychological help .
i can see the dilemma , but we also know what the results would be .
there is only one thing that we can say with any certainty , and that is that the road to peace is a long one .
we must not get impatient , and we the european parliament must help the commission and the council , not by heaping accusations upon them , but by means of mutual understanding in a difficult situation .
money is needed everywhere , but at the moment it is needed most urgently there .
we must therefore fulfil our obligations in difficult times as well , and we must not fail .
i am convinced we cannot wait for the revision of the financial perspectives to work out an ad hoc programme for the reconstruction of former yugoslavia .
i believe that even the most consistent aid - and as a european union we are certainly deeply committed to that - will be inadequate without the framework of a new programme .
that is fundamental to the credibility of the european union and to strengthening our right to intervene .
the first question is this : are we going to commit ourselves as soon as possible to drawing up a full reconstruction programme , a multiannual and renewable ad hoc programme ?
the second question concerns the fact that our international presence will certainly not be limited to 1996 .
in this respect the voices of the countries and the institutions that unite them should be clearer and more distinct .
madam president , first of all i should like to make it clear that the european union was the first and last to give help to the countries of the former yugoslavia in their time of need .
we are on the spot , and we are also active , and that is certainly all to the good .
so what really is the problem ?
right from the beginning the members of the european parliament have pointed out that the reconstruction of these countries cannot be assisted by the traditional methods and strategies of the european commission .
the giansily report highlights the fact that the current aid comes out of ten different budget headings , and this means that different commission services are trying to coordinate this aid , using different procedures .
we must also look at this question in the context of the other donors and of coordination with their aid .
i fear that in many cases aid is coordinated without taking other aid coordination measures into account .
so what , in my opinion , needs to be done ?
we need to tighten up the financial aid by means of a legal basis which has yet to be created . that point has already been mentioned .
the commission must organize efficient aid , and the process must be speeded up . that point has also been mentioned already .
because the current procedure , and the current phare process - and we have pointed this out on many occasions - is totally unsuitable .
phare is negotiated by means of interaction together with the recipient country , with the recipient governments , and individual projects are negotiated with the governments .
in bosnia-herzegovina , elections are imminent .
the phare programme can therefore be used as an election campaign tool by the present government , and that applies both to choice of project and to the possible delaying of a project .
europe has already looked to us once , when there was war in this region .
now the tender little shoots of peace have started to grow , and europe is looking to us again .
let us therefore see to it that we take care of those shoots by watering them , by watering them with money , so that they can thrive !
then , a few quick and blunt remarks : elections yes , because that is better than no elections , as long as they are well prepared .
to postpone them once again would be a setback .
we must see these elections as a beginning , not as giving up ; elections must be held to increase solidarity .
we can do this .
we should make this aid conditional .
and then , let us not do everything in a hurry and let us not disappear after the elections .
we must prepare the european relief force , even when we know that the american troops will leave .
this is the time to say to ourselves that , after the departure of the american troops , we shall still be needed for a long time .
let us show ourselves , we the europeans , to be capable of making up for what could be interpreted , perhaps even for electoral reasons , as giving up .
madam president , i must say that it is always a pleasure to hear the different views expressed .
i may not entirely agree with some of them , as in this debate when some members have said how the resources which have been allocated for emergency aid in yugoslavia should be used for other purposes .
i will not deny that there are many good ways of using money , and as always it is a question of priorities .
personally , i think we should be doing much more , but what we are seeing now is at least a beginning .
the reconstruction of former yugoslavia is a task which we should start as soon as possible .
the country is one great pile of bricks .
the refugees now living in other countries naturally have no wish to go back to a country where people die from going for a walk in the woods and where you have to walk several kilometres to fetch water .
it must be possible to live in these areas before the refugees can return .
they must have a future to go back to .
we need to help make a whole country habitable once again and create a decent life for millions of people .
we must not make them dependent on our emergency aid : our task is to enable these people to become self-sufficient and to stand on their own feet .
as vice-chairman of the committee on budgetary control , i am concerned about the final management of the resources .
there is such a great need for this support that it is a crime whenever a single ecu disappears on unnecessary administration and shoddy work , not to mention outright fraud .
so we must do all we can to check that the aid is reaching those for whom it is intended .
that may seem obvious , but it is so far from obvious that florence was the first time it happened .
i believe that will be recorded as a significant political fact because recognition is the prerequisite of any peace process .
no agreement can be stable and followed through if the contracting parties do not actually recognize each other and put mutual trust in each other 's good faith and determination to seek peace .
the second significant result obtained in florence was to set 14 september as the date for elections preceded by a very important step , the mostar elections of 30 june .
i believe this may be another essential and decisive step towards ensuring that the peace process puts down roots .
the main difficulties to be faced have already been mentioned .
there is no doubt that it is fundamental - and many members concentrated on this point - to accelerate reconstruction activity .
there is no nostalgia for yugoslavia involved in emphasizing this . yugoslavia no longer exists and any attempt to re-establish it would be doomed to failure .
a peace process which we too believe has now reached a crucial phase .
the first six months of the implementation period are now behind us and the next few months will tell whether the peace rests on a sufficiently firm foundation .
last week in florence we reviewed the present state of affairs in the peace implementation council , or pic as i shall call it .
next friday and saturday former yugoslavia will be discussed at the european council in florence , and it will also be a major item at the g7 / 8 summit in lyon .
i should mention , furthermore , that the european union has adopted a common position that it will not send any arms to bosnia whilst ifor is still present in bosnia .
as i say , huge efforts are being made , but there is a long way to go .
the guns may have fallen silent , but we are still a long way from a democratic and pluralistic bosnia-hercegovina .
mrs ogata , the high commissioner for refugees , spoke too of a situation which was & # x02bc ; not war but no peace either ' .
mr alavanos also spoke of this .
the return of the refugees is proving extremely difficult , the main reason being a lack of free movement and a lack of belief by the refugees that they will be safe when they do return .
fear , suspicion and nationalism are reinforcing the tendency towards total separation between the federation and the republika srpska and equally within the muslim-croat federation which is still by no means cohesive enough .
the recent announcement of the formation of a so-called bosnian-croat government is a serious setback and must be condemned in the strongest terms .
i have urged president tudjman through the croatian ambassador in brussels to help reverse this serious infringement of dayton .
elsewhere large-scale abuses of human rights still continue .
there is virtually no concern for freedom of the media .
the former belligerents are facing a life and death choice . either they must take the peace and reconciliation process seriously or they must fall back into war and profound suffering .
but on no account can this choice be left to those suspected of war crimes .
the continuing presence on the scene of karadzic and mladic represents a threat to the entire peace process .
and i fully agree with what various speakers have said here this afternoon and what mr mendiluce says in his report .
pressure must be put on milosevic to neutralize karadzic politically .
but he can only be politically neutralized if he is in fact handed over to the tribunal in the hague .
it is , i think , an illusion to suppose that they will refrain from political activity whilst they are still in the republika srpska .
the terms of dayton on the prosecution of war crimes must be complied with unconditionally .
we have just been told that the republika srpska has set up its own war crimes tribunal to try persons suspected of war crimes .
it seems to me an illusion to suppose that a war crimes tribunal set up by the republika srpska could arrogate to itself the powers of the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
our belief is that the obligation under dayton to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague remains fully in force .
after all there can be no greater incentive to repeat such crimes than the knowledge that they can be committed with impunity .
i would underline the exhortation in mr mendiluce 's report that the requirements of dayton should be uniformly interpreted and applied by the various international donors .
otherwise conditionality will remain a dead letter .
it is against this complicated political background that the international community is trying to organize the return of the refugees , to prepare the elections and rebuild the country .
the member states of the european union and the european commission are doing what they can to help with these efforts .
echo is one of the biggest contributors to the high commission for refugees .
and not only of aid to returning refugees but also of strictly humanitarian aid which , as we know , is given without any strings attached .
commissioner bonino reported on this in depth during the pic in florence last week .
in 1996 some 200 million ecu will be given in humanitarian aid to former yugoslavia .
current resources are insufficient and for this reason the commission will in the short term have to ask parliament for help in drawing on the reserve .
the member states and commission have given a significant financial contribution to the osce to help prepare for the elections .
an extra effort is being made - i mention this for mr oostlander 's benefit - to help the independent media .
efforts are under way jointly with the high representative to set up an independent tv station .
the pic was unanimous in its wish to see the elections held in accordance with the dayton schedule .
the conditions will not be ideal and tensions will be high .
the fact that this abuse was perpetrated by other muslims makes our outrage all the greater .
speaking from this house , i wish him a speedy recovery .
this requires proper structures , on the beneficiary side also . the federal structure must also help to ensure the coherence and integrity of bosnia-hercegovina .
to date some 250 million dollars have actually been spent . it is estimated that actual spending by the end of 1996 will have risen to some 800 million dollars .
the joint report by the european commission and world bank which was outlined to the pic last week makes important recommendations such as better coordination of donor operations and better coordination of projects .
improvements are advocated to the internal structure of the beneficiary , of bosnia-hercegovina .
i already mentioned that . reconstruction must focus more on projects which will facilitate the return of refugees .
naturally , for the hard-hit population of bosnia-hercegovina reconstruction cannot be fast enough , and it will only be effective if visible results are achieved quickly .
appropriate coordination is needed to achieve this , as mr titley 's report rightly stresses . and i understand the degree of impatience which is felt here .
tendering procedures have to be followed , which sometimes means unavoidable delays . so it is virtually inevitable that spending will be limited in scope during an initial phase .
i am grateful to mr titley for having pointed to these problems too . nevertheless the european commission will for its part do everything possible to speed up the rhythm of disbursements as much as possible .
ultimately the european union has said that it can provide community funds of about one billion ecu over the next four years . the world bank has also named a figure .
a further donor meeting will have to be held , probably this autumn , to secure funding for 1997 .
our view of course is that our contribution will not end after 1996 , that we shall have to continue our input .
madam president , just a few more words on the specific contribution of the commission through the community budget .
that point has been made this afternoon in the house .
you have recently been sent the draft regulation intended to provide the legal base for expenditure under these three budget headings .
given all the pressure to get monies for reconstruction paid out faster , i hope parliament will be able to reach a verdict quickly .
the first tranche of aid under the phare programme , totalling 62.5 million ecu , is now being paid over .
specific requirements are that they should intensify and liberalize their reciprocal trading relations .
madam president , bosnia-hercegovina is still sick and in the intensive care unit . as i say , international aid will still be needed beyond 1996 .
and we shall do so , but we cannot take that responsibility upon ourselves .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
assistance to the nis and mongolia
madam president , this is the third time i have spoken as rapporteur for tacis in the chamber , this time in the presence of the council of ministers .
before i start i should like to ask the council to reply to the questions and remarks arising from the debate .
because that has never yet happened , at least in the case of tacis .
if the council fails to respond here , as it has done in the past , i shall take that as a clear insult to parliament .
the old tacis regulation lapsed six months ago and there is still no new one .
the council could not take a decision at the time it was needed .
by postponing its decision the council has got bogged down in the furore over mad cow disease .
a british veto is now blocking tacis , a scandalous form of blackmail which hurts the russians and the other peoples of the cis , and this just a few days before the elections in russia .
so tacis is now in trouble .
all the member states of the european union repeatedly say that ties between the european union and the cis are extremely important and that the cis must be supported .
when it comes to the crunch , to continuing tacis projects , for example , the council backs out .
twice already the european parliament has responded promptly : to the european commission proposal on 16 november 1995 and the council proposal on 19 april 1996 .
in the fifteen months since the european commission 's proposal the council has not once contacted the european parliament or its rapporteur to discuss the tacis regulation .
on 14 may 1996 the council requested conciliation , as a matter of urgency , please note .
it took the council more than a month to ask for conciliation .
the council then had the nerve to request a debate for 6 june , when the normal procedure is three months .
what does the word conciliation mean in our various languages ?
what does the word conciliation mean in italian , mr president-in-office ?
i thought that conciliation meant talking together to see if we can reach agreement on certain points .
was it worth seeking agreement between the council and the ep ?
the european parliament put down 36 amendments , of which the european commission accepted 27 , in numerical terms alone an indication that the european commission regarded parliament 's amendments as not unimportant .
perhaps the commissioner would care to comment ?
what are these amendments about ?
first of all there is a set of amendments wanting greater accountability to parliament on spending .
parliament has budgetary powers here , so it is logical that the european parliament should wish to exercise effective scrutiny over this huge sum of money .
why is the council unwilling to accept any of the amendments dealing with this ?
why will the council not even discuss it ?
a second series of amendments concern management and specifically the management exercised by the council through the management committees .
this is the main bone of contention between council and parliament .
i believe that the work of the council 's management committees is responsible for the poor state of affairs surrounding the tacis programme .
of course , the council may feel differently about this , but surely , mr president-in-office , it is worth talking about it to parliament .
if the council refuses to accept these amendments it will bear full responsibility in future years if the tacis procedure fails .
a third series of amendments concerned the improvement of tendering procedures , one of the main factors which hold projects up .
the manner in which the council treats parliament is utterly indefensible .
the tacis programme , mr president-in-office , includes courses in democracy for the russians .
we , as the supposed wise men of the european union , think the russians need to learn how to be good democrats .
perhaps the members of the council of ministers could take a training course in how to apply the principles of parliamentary democracy properly .
in a way , madam president , the blackmail perpetrated by the united kingdom is a blessing in disguise .
the council has now won some time , time to hold the conciliation procedure with the european parliament again .
i suggest the council should make use of this chance and make good its earlier omissions .
madam president , my report is short and i hope to the point .
we consider that the conciliation procedure has not really taken place and thus has certainly not been completed .
the agreements of 4 march 1975 between the council , commission and parliament , pursuant to the treaty , have not been complied with .
i note that there is still time to restart the conciliation process . i am available to take part in it .
we need to ensure that we have a tacis regulation by 1 july so that the tacis projects which we consider so important do not stagnate .
mr president-in-office , we are currently living in historic times .
russia has gone through the first round of its first democratic election and we await the second round .
since we are hoping that the development of democracy in russia and other cis countries will progress , the approval of this regulation is of the utmost importance .
it is also important because as a consequence we can enjoy further stability in our neighbouring areas and ensure that this stability remains .
as a practical tool for this work we have the tacis programme , the development and improved practical applicability of which is the subject of the regulation amendment now being discussed .
the council 's consideration of the amendment of the tacis programme has been inexcusably slow .
the validity of the old regulation terminated early this year , and a new regulation has still not been enforced .
parliament on the other hand has worked within the schedule given , and drawn up a report of its own , the content of which is very good . the council has however ignored the proposals in the report .
a speedy acceptance of the tacis programme is however essential , which should also be the aim of parliament 's efforts .
i would like to thank mr pex for his contribution here today and also for his report .
the present central position of moscow in these programmes should be abandoned , and the planning and implementation of the programmes should be transferred to the regions which are in practice carrying out the programmes .
i would also like to emphasize the importance of ensuring , with this regulation , that the tacis and interreg programmes are linked together in border areas .
in this regard i would like to put a question to the commissioner .
in this year 's budget an amount equivalent to 30 million ecu was approved by parliament to be used for furthering cross border co-operation in border areas . why has this money still not been made available ?
mr president-in-office , i must express the deep displeasure of the parliamentary delegation and of the committee responsible , the rex committee . this displeasure is due to two clear things .
firstly , the procedure followed by the council and , secondly , the council 's attitude during this so-called conciliation procedure .
in my view the council 's approach is totally unacceptable .
only a small number of member states were represented .
those member state representatives who were present were not sufficiently senior to be either willing or able to defend a politically binding position .
without the slightest justification the council imposed a very short time limit on parliament , this same council which allows weeks and months to pass before it consults parliament .
the worst thing has been and remains the council 's attitude during the conciliation procedure .
even before this took place it was rumoured that the council would in any case not accept or even discuss a single one of the amendments approved by parliament or any of those approved by the commission .
this rumour was confirmed at the start of the conciliation procedure by the acting president-in-office of the council , ambassador cavacini .
after difficult and protracted deliberations the council had reached a compromise whereby nothing further could or should be amended .
this attitude negates the very spirit and letter of the conciliation procedure .
what is the sense of such a procedure ?
the council has made a real joke out of it , a farce , in effect it has insulted parliament . we cannot tolerate that .
the council is clearly trading on this and insulting us .
in those circumstances , madam president , mr president-in-office , the conciliation procedure is pointless !
the criticism that this report levels at the council , which did not make use of opportunities of reaching agreement with parliament , has been sufficiently well interpreted , and i fully agree with this criticism .
mr president-in-office of the council , previous speakers have pointed out various important points .
i should just like to emphasize certain aspects once again .
if we introduce a process such as the conciliation process , then there must be a reason for that process .
we are an institution within the european union , which consists of three conglomerations , namely the commission , the council and parliament .
but if we institutionalize such a process , regardless of what form it takes or how flexible it is , then that process must have sensible and reasonable legitimacy .
mr de clercq has already pointed this out . it is shameful to see how you treat us and how we all , indirectly , treat one another .
please , allow this procedure to be taken seriously , as it should be in principle , and allow us to conduct reasonable negotiations !
we have made 36 proposals , and 27 of them have been accepted by the commission .
perhaps you accept only six of these proposals , but then at least allow us to talk about these six , or five , or ten , or however many you like .
and do not come to the conciliation process , like the one we have had , and present us with those proposals that you are not prepared to accept .
we want to hear about those that you are willing to accept , because those are the ones that we can talk about .
only then - and i would ask you to really give this some thought - can the work of the institutions , the european parliament , the commission and the council , serve the public better .
we must present our work as serious cooperation , even if , among ourselves , this is purely symbolic .
even symbols , as we know , have their serious side .
please , let us enter into negotiations once more .
let us know which proposals you are able to accept , and you will find that parliament is willing to listen , and the committees too , as you know , are always willing to listen .
please allow us to come up with some serious results .
madam president , despite all the aggravation i at least would like to thank parliament for the fact that it has twice now given an opinion on the draft regulation under extreme pressure of time .
for this reason the commission too is sorry that the council saw fit to reject all the amendments proposed by the european parliament and we regret too that the conciliation procedure did not deliver the desired result .
on top of that , unfortunately , the united kingdom blocked the approval of the regulation by the general affairs council on 10 june for reasons well known to us .
this sends an extremely negative political signal to the new independent states , especially russia , which is currently experiencing a politically difficult period .
and all this may seriously delay implementation of the tacis programme for 1996 .
it is thus most important that this legal vacuum should be filled and the new regulation approved as quickly as possible .
i repeat , i am very grateful to the commission and to parliament for this .
so i can only hope that the right conditions will shortly be created to enable the new regulation to be implemented .
lastly , i think it was mrs myller who asked why the money to be spent on cross-border cooperation has not yet been used .
this is entirely due to the fact that the new regulation has not come into force .
as you know , that sum is set aside under the new programme of tacis 1996 ; nevertheless preparations for its disbursement are already in hand .
it will also clearly serve to promote stability and facilitate considerably the resumption of contacts between the peoples to the east and west of that border .
once the regulation has come into effect a start can be made on actually carrying out these projects .
i recognize that parliament feels dissatisfaction and indeed irritation towards the council .
all i can do is start my speech by repeating bernadotte 's famous remark : i realize everything is against me except your personal kindness .
on 19 april , parliament proposed 36 new amendments , which would have significantly altered the text agreed by the council the previous january .
naturally this does not alter the fact that , in this case , relations between the council and parliament have been difficult and complex , and legitimate proposals and well-founded arguments have been sacrificed .
but a political judgement had to be made about priorities and a premium was put on urgency .
thank you very much , mr fassino .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
question time ( council )
the next item is question time to the council ( b4-566 / 96 ) .
mr president , i have asked for the floor because i seek guidance from the president-in-office of the council .
parliament will recall and the record shows that during the last question time to the council i asked a series of questions regarding the turkish financial cooperation agreement with the european community .
i will not summarize these just now because that would take up time from other people 's questions .
the president-in-office said then that he would return this question time and give me the answers which i sought last session but which he was unable to provide at that time .
could he please advise me when he will be giving the answers ?
will it be before , during or at the end of question time ?
i think i am in a position to reply to mr falconer at the end of question time .
question no 1 by mr tillich ( h-0443 / 96 )
subject : european voluntary service for young people
according to the information available to me , no arrangements have yet been made to allow young people to spend a period of more than three months abroad .
is this one of a number of problems which have led to the postponement of the action until next year ?
in reply to the honourable member i want to make it clear that as of today no proposal for a pilot project for a voluntary youth service has reached the council .
as i understand it , the idea for the european voluntary service year for young people arose during the german presidency .
during the last six months , the commission has succeeded in drawing up a proposal for this pilot project , naturally with the support of the european parliament , which has made the necessary financial resources available .
in my opinion there is a need for clarification here .
in case the point is not clear , let me explain that the honourable member is referring to the presumed decision of the german presidency . since then there has been a spanish presidency .
i repeat , it may be useful to ask the commission to put forward proposals on this matter , and when they are presented the presidency of the council will examine them .
question no 2 by mr watson ( h-0445 / 96 )
subject : uniform electoral procedure for elections to the european parliament
what action does the presidency intend to take to ensure that the original commitment of the treaty of rome to the establishment of a uniform electoral procedure is honoured before the treaty of maastricht is updated ?
will the presidency take action to fulfil its treaty obligation to this parliament and put an end once and for all to the ridiculous situation whereby parliament could be elected by 16 different electoral systems in 1999 ?
this is a matter which , as you know , has been the subject of political discussions amongst europhiles and those concerned about europe for many years .
the adoption of a uniform electoral procedure to upgrade the current situation by which each country elects its own representatives to the european parliament by its own procedure is a recurrent issue .
in establishing the programme for the intergovernmental conference , the turin european council included in the agenda the examination of the composition of the european parliament and the uniform procedure for electing it .
at this point it seems to me that the matter is now the prerogative of the intergovernmental conference , like many other institutional reform issues .
the presidency of the council can only hope that progress will be made in that forum in the direction of a uniform procedure for the election of the european parliament .
does the presidency recognize that this house has a socialist majority purely because of the operation of the united kingdom 's electoral system ?
the united kingdom labour party took only 45 % of the vote but has 75 % of the united kingdom 's seats here .
would the presidency not therefore ensure that this item stays on the agenda of the igc until we get a resolution ?
i wonder if the italian presidency will recognize from the form of this question that this is blatantly a matter of domestic rather than european concern .
i think the presidency would agree that we have made much progress towards a common system .
we have members elected on the basis of a similar electorate , we have elections in all the countries at the same time , and so on .
what is really being pressed , it seems here , is that the precise method of election should be the same .
does not the presidency feel that this would be an intrusion because it would force countries to adopt for one kind of election a system they find quite inappropriate in all the other elections they have ?
i am perfectly prepared for each country to continue with the system it prefers .
while this debate is , of course , very interesting , i must say it is taking a rather questionable turn .
i had my hand up for some considerable time before mr elliott . therefore i wonder why he was chosen .
i appreciate the president-in-office of the council 's answers and particularly the reply to mr elliott .
it shows that he is not accepting this imposition of stalinist / liberal views across the whole of europe .
i appreciate that entirely .
it is a queer view for liberals to adopt in these circumstances .
but turning to the question of ' ridiculous systems ' .
can he advise us of what he regards as ' ridiculous systems ' ?
does he think , for example , the pr system which operates in germany and has produced over one million spoilt ballot papers thus defranchising one million people is ridiculous ?
does he think that the pr system in france which has resulted in two million spoilt ballot papers is a bit ridiculous ?
or does he think that the system in his own country , italy , which has produced over seven million spoilt ballot papers - almost the population of london - is a bit ridiculous ?
that is what mr watson and his ilk are trying to impose upon the rest of us .
the united kingdom has a clear record of the lowest number of spoilt ballot papers when people go to vote .
they understand the system .
they know what they are voting for .
( mr von habsburg spoke without a microphone )
anything is possible , but we do have a strict rule which only allows two other speeches , two supplementary questions , after the council 's reply .
i therefore ask everyone to show a little tolerance and indeed fairness towards other members .
mr president , i simply wish to remind you that an agreement exists whereby supplementary questions should be put by members belonging to different political groups . that has not been the case here .
as no-one else wanted to speak i gave mr falconer the floor .
mr von habsburg 's objection is correct , however .
question no 3 by mr papakyriazis ( h-0509 / 96 ) .
subject : blocking of eu business by the uk
will the council say whether it will allow a member state virtually to paralyse eu business by preventing all decision-taking and jeopardizing by its behaviour the attainment of treaty objectives ?
what developments does it foresee ?
how will it address this situation and what measures does it intend to take ?
it seems to me , then , that this is the real issue raised by the mad cow crisis .
european year against racism and xenophobia and the commission that would consequently have been set up has in any case been blocked , along with a thousand other dossiers .
i am very grateful to the president -in-office for his detailed and extensive answer , and i consider it satisfactory .
all of this goes to show , mr president-in-office , that , yes , there really is an institutional issue .
i respect absolutely and agree with your academic and general political appraisal .
but that is not the issue here .
it is not just a general political matter any more , nor , certainly , an academic institutional issue . it is , rather , a question of options and decisions .
mr president-in-office , ladies and gentlemen , i am concerned for my fellow-europeans in the british isles .
i am concerned for my fellow-europeans across the whole of the european union , and for the people of the whole world .
permit me to say , as a professor of medicine , that i understand the problems stemming from mad cow disease .
but that is not the issue .
the issue facing us is what to do about this dangerous paralysis of our general functioning .
because from time to time certain countries have , in fact , been habitually , and unjustifiably , depicted as the black sheep of the european union .
but anyway , i , for my part , do not want to view the government of mr major as the black cow of the european union .
i refer to what president dini said here this morning .
i raised the matter this morning with president dini , then with president santer .
of course , neither has replied .
in the present very specific case , the british position is a non position , and therefore an abstention , which legitimately authorizes you to take decisions that are completely valid .
it is up to great britain to go before the court of justice to have these decisions ruled to be invalid .
we wish them good luck .
why do you not do this ?
and what arguments have your lawyers so far advanced against this proposal ?
in principle there are no legal obstacles to using the instrument parliament is calling for .
but political judgement is what is needed .
the british attitude of non-cooperation has aroused great tension in the union .
we want this state of tension ended and perhaps this can be done through an agreement based on political logic .
i think what you are asking for should be a last resort , and before we reach that point we are trying to resolve the matter through persuasion .
that is the view of the presidency of the council .
i do not think recourse to the court of justice would calm the situation down , it would just make everything more complicated and tense .
politics is the art of negotiation !
mr president , i believe that mr herman has presented the issue in its proper terms .
i welcomed the statement this morning by the president-in-office of the council , mr dini , and i welcome mr fassino 's interpretation of the issue .
i think that mr fassino is right when he says that this is a political matter , but that it also has a legal aspect .
and there is some truth in what mr herman has just said .
in any event , i believe that this issue is beginning to be addressed in its proper legal terms .
question no 4 by mr newens ( h-0404 / 96 )
subject : freedom of the press
this is an issue of enormous significance .
as we all know , information and full freedom of expression through information channels of every kind is of the utmost importance in today 's modern society .
obviously we all agree that plurality of information is and must remain a fundamental principle of the state of law and democracy in our countries and in every country .
i should like to thank the president-in-office for his reply .
i should really like to have it in english so it would be available for outside information .
however it really does not deal with the problem because what we are asking is what action can the council take to prevent discrimination against such publications .
at present too few publications with limited circulation are handled by large media distribution companies and if we allow those that are available to vanish from the shelves it will be a sad state of affairs .
therefore , i share the president-in-office 's views on these matters .
the reality is that mergers and acquisitions are putting enormous power in the hands of distributors and newspaper publishers which means that these two cartels working together can shift magazines and newspapers off the shelves at a whim .
so we are asking what action can the council take in these matters ?
the council can only agree with the need raised by the honourable member and hope to receive proposals from the commission .
as the author is not present , question no 5 lapses .
question no 6 by mr theonas ( h-0407 / 96 )
subject : tension in kosovo
this is a very delicate issue and of course a very important one .
we all know that for years there has been an unresolved problem about protecting the rights of the majority albanian population living in the kosovo region .
now i do not want to enter into a general discussion and will naturally restrict myself to the terms of the question .
the honourable member makes explicit reference to the dayton agreement .
i am grateful to the president-in-office , at least for the length of his answer .
i agree with that evaluation and i confirm the commitment of the presidency of the council to take action in all settings to encourage a solution .
mr president-in-office of the council , first of all i should like to thank you for your clear answers .
however , in connection with kosovo i should like to make one comment .
you have read out to us some very fine-sounding statements , containing demands that human rights should finally be respected .
but we have a credibility problem here , because we have threatened all manner of things , but have not really taken any serious action .
on the one hand we issue statements , but on the other hand the sanctions are increasingly being relaxed , and the serbs continue their provocative behaviour .
they are just laughing at us !
mr president-in-office , it is vital that we should regain our credibility .
do you not think that this would be a good opportunity ?
i agree with you , i think you are right . the challenge is , of course , to do it more effectively .
it is a matter of achieving maximum effectiveness .
i am not going to pretend that it is not complicated and difficult to protect the kosovo albanians , especially after these four years of war in bosnia and throughout former yugoslavia .
in any case i agree with you , and the presidency of the council is determined to deal with this problem in a credible way .
mr president , the collapse of yugoslavia was triggered in kosovo by the major deployment there of a million serbs in 1989 , and by the abolition of autonomy .
so why has kosovo retreated into the background ?
because the albanians of kosovo , who are not a minority , but rather the majority in kosovo , did not use force , but deliberately chose non-violent means .
i see a very dangerous development here .
if this majority , the albanian majority , is punished because it chose non-violent methods , then this will send the message that violence is necessary in this region .
i therefore take the view that we should have a kosovo conference of our own , since kosovo was omitted by mistake from the list of conditions for the recognition of what remains of yugoslavia .
in addition , i believe that elections should be held there in the presence of international observers .
i think there is an urgent need for action here , before catastrophe strikes .
so far , this has only been done in one case , that of macedonia , and in that case it was helpful .
we really ought to take preventive measures , because otherwise violence will flare up again there , and will spread like wildfire .
it is by no means a marginal flashpoint and obviously not just a consequence of the events of the last few years . in fact it has been a flashpoint for a long time .
we are all well aware of twentieth century history : the problems of the albanians and kosovo have repeatedly sparked conflict and tension .
it seems to me that all this should increase our determination to work towards a political solution to the problem .
as the author is not present , question no 7 lapses .
question no 8 by mr lomas ( h-0410 / 96 )
subject : death of mr huseyin koku
will the council please press the appropriate turkish authorities for information regarding the death of mr huseyin koku , who was arrested in elbiston on 20 october 1994 ?
nothing further was heard of the prisoner until 27 april 1995 when the police advised his wife that his body had been found .
no details have ever been given to his wife and family .
i will reply to this question in two parts .
i am sure the council will appreciate the anguish of the family of this murdered man .
i do not think they would use the term ' delicacy ' , as the council did .
the last time they saw him alive he was in police custody .
now , of course , we know , regrettably , that it is all too common in turkey for the police and the military to murder its citizens .
but just general condemnation - while that has to be made - is really not sufficient .
it is just so blatantly unlikely .
i ask council to press this specific case , rather than just make generalized condemnations .
naturally this is not just a hope , it is a goal the european union is working towards by bringing pressure to bear in every necessary way .
mr president , this is just one example that the questioner has raised concerning the situation in turkey .
a habitat conference was held very recently in turkey which also demonstrated police methods of dealing with their kurdish and turkish fellow citizens .
i would like to ask whether the council does not draw any conclusions from the judgement which mr fassino says the council made in connection with the customs union agreement with turkey .
the judgement was , after all , as you say , that it was better to allow turkey to conclude an agreement and to exert influence in that way .
several months have now elapsed .
have any of us and have you in the council seen any improvement in conditions as regards human rights , democracy and freedom of expression ?
i have not seen any such thing .
no , i do not think that interpretation can be put on my position and i do not believe that is the intention of the european union .
the argument is not of a purely legal nature and there are no suspensive conditions to be interpreted in legal terms .
we have to make a political judgement .
there is nothing in the rules which prohibits this .
this decision is based on an interpretation of what is written there by the staff sitting on your left-hand side .
mr president , that is wrong .
the rules of procedure are very rigid on this point .
i welcome mr falconer 's suggestion that it be referred to the committee on the rules of procedure , the verification of credentials and immunities for amendment .
but i will put the question to the committee on the rules , mr falconer .
now we must move on to the next question .
question no 9 by mr kranidiotis ( h-0415 / 96 )
subject : the di roberto report on cyprus
in january the italian presidency appointed ambassador di roberto as its special representative on cyprus .
mr di roberto visited the parties concerned , heard their points of view and in april submitted his report to the council .
this is another particularly delicate political issue .
as regards the renewal of the dialogue between the two communities , despite many difficulties the turkish cypriot leadership recently confirmed again that it was ready to renew interinstitutional dialogue without preconditions .
obviously the irish presidency will need to continue the action carried out in these six months by the italian presidency and operate in close contact with the troika to monitor every possibility of a solution .
i am grateful to the president-in-office for his answer . however , i am sorry to have to say that the results of the di roberto mission fall short of our expectations .
nevertheless , i am glad that the irish presidency intends to continue with this initiative .
it has been agreed that cyprus will be included in the next enlargement and that negotiations with it will begin six months after the end of the intergovernmental conference .
naturally i can only concur with the demand for a wider and more effective initiative , and it will obviously be up to the irish presidency to see how practicable this is and implement it .
we hope things will improve in the future .
i , too , wish to thank the president-in-office .
i regard the intention of the irish presidency to continue with the initiative as equally positive .
i would , however , like to ask the president-in-office whether mr di roberto 's mission brought any actual gain which can further the work of the new , irish presidency , mediator .
and something else : during the period of mr di roberto 's mission , we had the statements from denktash , of which you will be aware , about the fate of the missing greek cypriots in cyprus .
did mr di roberto himself deal with that question , and what does his report say , if , in fact , he has submitted a report ?
i just wish the house to know that i will remain here for this particular purpose .
i hope that has been entered in the record .
question no 10 by mr vieira ( h-0418 / 96 )
subject : poseima
poseima is a wide-ranging programme for the autonomous regions of madeira and the azores .
it includes various measures which have quite rightly been of benefit to agriculture , fisheries , handicrafts , energy , consumers , the environment , taxation , etc .
i imagine that the commission will seek to ensure that this programme is continued , if only because the text establishing it makes no general reference to expiry dates .
however , in some cases , the periods for the granting of aid are stipulated , e.g. in the case of the extra cost of the maritime transport of petroleum products .
but it is not up to the council to present the proposals or justify them , it is up to the commission , so i agree with you on the need to ask the commission .
i will stop the questions now .
but there remains mr fassino 's commitment to reply to mr falconer on a question left open from the previous question time .
the departments have worked hard to get me all the details i need to give mr falconer an answer as promised .
we have a written answer for mr falconer which is probably more precise and comprehensive than anything i could say here off the cuff .
i think it contains all the desired information . if mr falconer is not satisfied then we can return to the discussion at the next question time .
so we have even satisfied mr falconer .
i want to thank the president-in-office of the council for the cooperation and availability he has shown us in the past few months .
questions not taken will be answered in writing .
that concludes question time .
ladies and gentlemen , with your permission , the sitting will now commence .
the next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions :
madam president , i am sorry that this is taking place at the same time as a very important european event between germany and italy .
i myself am also reluctantly present .
i assume that the discussions tonight will be very brief .
behind the oral question under discussion this evening there is concern that the idea of free movement of people already included in the treaty of rome has not been genuinely enforced within the european union .
the question should be resolved over two separate time spans .
the future of the nordic passport union has to be safeguarded within the next few months of negotiations between the schengen countries and the nordic countries .
a pragmatic and realistic solution to the problem is about to be reached .
the governments of iceland and norway have stated that they are prepared to abide by the terms of the present schengen agreement .
these countries have the right to give their opinion on any future decisions made within the schengen agreement .
similar rights for iceland and norway to veto decisions is of course not on the agenda .
the alternative for these countries is either to accept future decisions made by the schengen countries or to withdraw from the schengen agreement .
citizens of the five nordic countries wish to be part of a wider european territory , where there are no border formalities .
on the other hand it is not acceptable to give up the passport exemption clause which has worked for decades .
that is something we simply cannot afford to do .
as a long-term objective the schengen agreement should be made part of the fundamental agreements of the eu .
this is the only way to ensure democratic decision-making and a judicial monitoring by the european court .
the liberal group considers this to be one of the most important objectives of the present igc .
the council and the commission should set a schedule for achieving the objective , for example by the end of year 2000 .
the answer will show how serious the council and the commission are about creating a people 's europe , which essentially is what this discussion is about .
madam president , free movement of persons is one of the union 's most important objectives .
the same is true of more or less all other conventions which come under the third pillar .
as a result , we have no success with the compensatory measures which in themselves constitute the conditions for freedom of movement .
we must in fact at least deal with the most necessary of these : the external borders and the fight against drugs .
deadlocks in the council often result from member states ' mistrust of other states ' ability to take sensible political decisions .
quite simply , there is no sense of trust and this must be established .
here we have nordic cooperation , which represents practical progress .
nordic police , customs and drugs cooperation is on an everyday basis .
we trust one another , in fact .
it ought to be possible to transfer this to eu level .
even if the methods are different , the objectives are the same , for example that drug traffickers and terrorists should not be allowed to move freely across european borders .
in the nordic countries we do not close the borders because the other country is pursuing some policy which we perhaps do not entirely approve of .
we exercise trust rather than mistrust .
we have had a passport union for over 40 years - it must be retained .
the nordic countries have been a forerunner of and an example to the eu in this regard .
we have achieved the goals which the eu is pursuing in this area and therefore it is only logical that the nordic countries should be involved in continuing developments .
it is important to bind europe together , not to split it , and so the links must become stronger .
the union should be enlarged not only to the east but also to the north and the south .
this means stronger links with the democratic , market-oriented countries around us .
the union must not contract .
our values must be disseminated .
there are some technical and practical problems , concerning such things as air travel and baggage .
i believe that sweden would be able to help in this connection .
perhaps some of the travellers could travel via sweden , as we have in fact solved this problem .
it is not the technical resolution of each little detail which is important and upon which we should concentrate , even though the information parliament receives on how solutions are found needs to be clearer .
the important thing is to incorporate these new countries in a properly functioning legal system , where the court and parliament have a supervisory role .
to put it simply : iceland and norway must be part of things .
i do not doubt for a second that the commission will be able to take the initiative in this area .
however , will the council manage to live up to european , democratic values ?
because of obstruction on the part of a number of countries , capital can move freely within the union , but not people .
all manner of specious arguments are frequently deployed to hide the lack of the political will to make freedom of movement a reality .
of course we know that international cooperation is needed for matters of internal security and to combat fraud and crime .
in today 's world security cannot , of course , be guaranteed by member states , national member states .
but internal borders are no obstacle to the criminal , ladies and gentlemen .
and my group is very much opposed to the linking of internal security and the movement of individuals .
parliament has also repeatedly criticized the ad hoc way in which structures have been put in place at varying speeds under the schengen agreements .
in a democratic constitutional state , ladies and gentlemen , the principle is that the police have to be answerable to the state .
that means the safeguarding of the citizen 's rights , judicial and parliamentary scrutiny , and schengen in no way guarantees that .
even the national parliaments are barely able to exercise scrutiny .
so schengen has to be replaced by european legislation .
meantime the parliaments have made a start by coordinating parliamentary scrutiny within the schengen area .
so i think it is crucial that the european parliament should be associated with this coordination , because schengen is very much a european thing .
but schengen is clearly proving successful , perhaps more so than we would like .
take the agreement currently being negotiated on the accession of the nordic passport union to schengen .
two of these nordic countries are not members of the european union , though this was a requirement for signatories of the schengen agreements .
in itself , enlargement of the area in which there is free movement of individuals is naturally a very good thing , but in this particular case i have two observations to make .
firstly , it is inconceivable to us that new borders should be created within the nordic passport union , which has existed since 1954 , just because of schengen .
schengen , ladies and gentlemen , provides for its own abolition once the union assumes its duties . and there must be no threat to that .
so i ask the council and commission what they will be doing , bearing in mind the accession of all the nordic states , to have the subject matter covered by the schengen agreement gradually incorporated into community law .
because that is what we all want .
people are not able to move within northern europe as they used to .
the green group feels that the fact that the data protection legislation is rather questionable presents a major problem for the schengen agreement .
there is also a problem regarding what would happen if norway were to decide to stay outside the schengen agreement .
free movement should be developed by means other than the schengen agreement within the european union , and such issues as those concerning data protection and the position of the individual are absolutely vital .
mr president , in today 's oral questions , the passport freedom which exists in scandinavia is referred to as the nordic passport union , but that is not its proper name .
there is no nordic union , not even for the smoothly functioning cooperation between the scandinavian countries .
there is a protocol on passport freedom which was adopted by the scandinavian governments in copenhagen in 1954 , and an agreement on passport controls concluded in 1957 .
this freedom of movement in scandinavia , which has worked perfectly well for 40 years , forms an interesting contrast to the schengen convention .
the nordic protocol is a singlepage document .
the schengen convention is a bureaucratic pile-up , a tragi-comic hotchpotch of monitoring and control of both the countries ' own citizens and foreign subjects .
and this contrast can be explained .
the cooperation in scandinavia is organic ; it has grown out of legal and cultural communities which are hundreds of years old .
it has not been imposed on the scandinavian people as a reflection of a pressure from the demands of the market economy for open frontiers .
the cooperation in scandinavia is well balanced and works without the police accompaniment and sophisticated monitoring which are the hallmark of the schengen convention .
schengen , on the other hand , is not organic . schengen is structured , and what a structure it is !
in an interminable legal document consisting of 143 articles , with subparagraphs and indents to subparagraphs , the authors have designed a system of monitoring and control which beats any police mechanism seen before .
it is legitimized as compensation for the removal of controls at internal frontiers referred to in article 7a of the treaty on european union .
one might venture to say that the means are overshadowing the ends .
note the conspiratorial way in which the schengen structure came into existence .
the first agreement between the five governments which began the initiative was carefully kept secret for many years .
only several years after the original agreements did the top-secret documents gradually become accessible .
it is not a system which came about as a result of a free debate .
schengen has the kind of totalitarian features which would shock any democrat .
it is a way of establishing a fortress europe at the same time as tightening internal controls .
there was every reason to keep the schengen plan secret : it would not have received a great deal of popular support .
we are losing the constant struggle of our peoples for democracy and legal safety when we arm ourselves with monitoring and control mechanisms and increased police powers .
yes , but surely schengen is a system which has been set up independently from the union ?
strictly speaking , that is correct , as the norwegian justice minister told his country 's parliament .
according to the minister , the schengen convention is a separate , independent agreement under international law .
matters can be explained in such a way , but to do so one has to choose to ignore reality and interpret the schengen agreement in a convenient political context .
the realities behind the formal jurisprudence show that schengen is functionally integrated into the union .
and the eu 's list of countries whose citizens require a visa is identical to the list adopted under the schengen system .
for scandinavia , this means that we shall suddenly be introducing a visa requirement for countries whose citizens have been able to travel freely to us for years .
but they will not in fact be asked , it would appear from the vote today .
we have the automatic mechanism which has frequently been mentioned : one step brings another with it .
for norway , membership of the eea and schengen means belonging to two thirds of the eu , without having any influence .
for the other peoples of scandinavia , joining schengen is a tragedy in terms of democracy and their legal policy .
obviously i am referring to the question of the countries of northern europe , but it is a general question .
madam president , the nordic countries ' passport union has been in operation for more than forty years .
unlike the schengen agreement , it has operated well .
but then it is completely different from the schengen agreement .
it means that one has the right to travel freely without a passport , though border controls are still carried out .
it is a model which has considerable popular support .
the nordic passport union must be retained .
the swedish government has made it clear that it would not be appropriate for sweden to become a party to schengen unless all the nordic countries do .
it is impossible not only politically but also in practical terms to have a schengen border between sweden and norway .
the nordic countries have now been offered an agreement by the schengen countries which would mean all the nordic countries adopting the schengen model .
for norway and iceland this would mean that they would have to comply but without being able to exert any influence .
they would not have voting rights on the schengen executive committee but would on the other hand have to approve all future decisions , on pain of having to leave the entire schengen system - immediately .
i believe that in democratic terms such a model is totally unacceptable .
it is moreover an extraordinarily unstable model ; all it needs is for norway to say no once and a schengen border would have to be erected between sweden and norway .
never before has the nordic passport union been so threatened as it is today by this arrangement .
my next question is this : what will happen when the schengen agreement becomes part of eu law ?
we know that that day is relatively close .
at the intergovernmental conference highly technical and highly concrete discussions are currently taking place on how schengen should become part of eu law .
if that happens the court of justice will have jurisdiction and then the norwegian constitution would have to be amended .
if such an amendment were moved , it would be sufficient for every fourth member of the norwegian parliament to vote against for norway not to be able to become a party to schengen .
at present more than every fourth member of the norwegian parliament is opposed to the schengen agreement .
this means that the nordic passport union is at direct risk from the arrangements being made now and the current haste is completely incomprehensible , when we do not yet know how the intergovernmental conference will turn out .
it puts nordic passport freedom at risk .
in actual fact it is a central part of the european union 's development of a common policy on justice .
this is what iceland and norway are to subject themselves to , without having any influence , despite having taken the democratic decision not to become members of the european union with all its regulations .
furthermore , the promised passport freedom may turn out to be something other than expected .
with regard to other parts of the world , such as third world countries , it means stricter controls .
it may also mean that we are forced to carry identity documents .
sweden has already received reminders from france and the netherlands that swedish citizens should have special id cards when they travel abroad .
i therefore wonder what kind of freedom it is when a passport is simply replaced by an id card .
as i see it , it is no freedom at all .
it is that all five nordic countries should decide not to accede to the schengen agreement .
madam president , the council of baltic sea states ' summit meeting in visby , at which the eu was represented at the highest level , was a success and that is very important .
the baltic region represents a compact european problem .
the baltic region has great promise but also entails considerable risks .
mr santer presented what is known as the eu 's baltic initiative , which lays a basis for further efforts on the part of the union .
security issues are not on the actual agenda for the council of baltic sea states but in this respect too the council has an important role to play .
the summit provided the first opportunity for informal discussions at the highest level between the russian prime minister and leaders of the three baltic states .
there will be opportunities for such contacts at subsequent meetings at ministerial level .
the security situation will also be furthered by networks of contacts at all levels involving civil servants , industrialists and academics .
the eu and the council of baltic sea states can facilitate an intensification of all these networks .
such an initiative would bring peoples closer .
as part of the preparations for the visby summit a group of prominent business leaders held a business summit at which they adopted an agenda of measures to stimulate increased economic activity , investment and trade .
the chair of the business leaders group was invited to give an account of this agenda at the visby summit .
it is important that this industrial cooperation is facilitated and fostered and that industry recognises and makes the most of the opportunities .
in this way the resource flows arising from the european union aid effort and bilateral programmes can be enlarged and vitalised .
the motion for a resolution also stresses the importance of creating better legal structures in the countries which are now undergoing political and economic transformation .
a country should be built on the basis of law .
law faculties at universities were seriously neglected during the soviet era .
there is an important task for the eu here , namely to support national efforts to develop legal competence .
madam president , the schengen agreement was signed as long ago as 1985 but it was ten years before it came into force .
most schengen countries and their citizens are today extremely critical of the agreement .
in many other countries there is also a great deal of mistrust .
in order to achieve something positive - free movement - it was felt that a great many negative measures had to be taken and this has led to the idea of fortress europe .
is it not time to recognise that the schengen agreement which is so subject to criticism is neither the best nor the only way of achieving free movement of persons ?
the nordic passport union is another way ; it has been in operation for over forty years and really does allow people free movement , without creating walls against the world outside , and it must be preserved .
what does free movement mean from an eu perspective ?
high walls against the outside world and advanced systems of control , replacing fixed internal border control points with peripatetic controls on the inside , exchanging passports for an obligatory schengen id card , and so on .
everything being monitored by a police office we call europol .
the green group wishes to express its total opposition to the integration of the schengen model in the union and regards it as regrettable that the council 's working documents show that work is already being done on this .
now the convention is blocked and it is also blocking other important acts , for instance the dublin convention on the right of asylum .
so i would like us all to give this our attention and i hope that the commission and the council take positions on this .
furthermore , the council is devoting attention to the draft convention on the crossing by persons of the external frontiers of the member states of the european union .
the council is also looking at the relationship between the nordic passport union and the draft convention on the crossing by persons of the external frontiers of member states .
it is not up to the council to take a position on the implications of the nordic passport union and the extension of the provisions of the schengen agreement .
any communitization of such sectors , envisaged by the schengen agreement , can only be achieved in accordance with the procedures laid down by article k.9 or article m of the treaty on european union .
i have already mentioned the nordic council ; i would also like to mention the central european initiative which also specifically targets the baltic because poland has been involved from the start .
madam president , the european parliament has always strongly supported the abolition of internal frontier controls on persons , an aim written into the treaty under article 7a .
so i find it logical that honourable members are interested in the development of schengen , especially the relationship between the schengen agreement and the achievement of this objective throughout the union .
from this viewpoint , schengen currently suffers from an institutional deficit .
so it is hardly surprising if the citizens do not have a real and positive perception of european integration .
mr dell ' alba , whom i thank for his appreciation of these proposals , wonders how the european parliament can help the commission .
on the second point - cooperation between schengen and norway and iceland - i recognize that , at the appropriate time , the union will have to deal with the same problem already encountered by the schengen group .
the schengen member states and the countries of the nordic union are of the opinion that denmark , finland and sweden being party to the agreement must not compromise the acquis of the nordic union .
when we are close to achieving abolition of internal frontier controls on persons in the european union , that clearly should not become a reason for eliminating the acquis of the nordic union , which dates back forty years .
so we must find appropriate solutions for this .
i believe schengen may , and indeed should , also function as precursor in terms of twinning the areas without frontiers of the nordic union and the european union .
i come now , much more briefly , to the questions on the baltic sea states summit held in visby .
on 17 april commissioner van den broek explained to parliament the objective of the visby meeting and the role the commission would play there .
the meeting supported the efforts made by estonia , latvia , lithuania and poland to join the european union .
on the questions by mr roth and others , i want to confirm that nuclear safety is one of the commission 's priorities .
we are trying to strengthen international collaboration in this field but we must not forget that this is primarily a matter for national governments .
i thank commissioner monti for his very detailed replies and i give the floor to mrs iivari , on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists .
madam president , i am going to talk about the summit in visby , and i would like to take the opportunity to thank the council 's and the commission 's representatives for their contributions here today .
the development in the baltic and the mediterranean areas is important for the stability and prosperity of the whole of europe .
the european union 's active involvement in creating democracy , strengthening economies and overcoming environmental problems is essential both in the south and in the north .
it is essential that the political results reached regarding the baltic area at the summit held in visby are put into practice without delay .
it was of great value that all states in the baltic area , including russia , participated in the summit , in addition to the european union .
let that be a start to a strengthening of the nordic dimension within the union .
the council and the commission should now draw up a programme as soon as possible for the initiatives required to implement the decisions made at the summit .
in the baltic area widespread co-operation is required in order to counteract international crime and resolve severe environmental problems , amongst other things .
an energy network comprising the whole of europe , linking norway 's and russia 's gas resources , should be extended to this area .
the phare and interreg programmes should also be integrated and implemented in such a way that they offer real benefits in creating democracy and public well-being in the baltic countries .
the european union 's baltic policy should be based on existing europe agreements as well as a full implementation of co-operation and partnership agreements .
the baltic area , which in many respects is in a very delicately balanced , requires a framework for co-operation which respects the independence of all countries and guarantees human rights for citizens in the whole area .
this co-operation cannot be left to words alone .
madam president , commissioner , mr president-in-office , i have listened with pleasure to the comments made concerning baltic cooperation .
i was visited today by some television people who work a great deal on media cooperation in the east .
we talked about the cultural aspects too , and i would recommend that those aspects should also be addressed in all the discussions on the economy .
i think that on this scandinavian evening , a welcoming voice should be heard from denmark among the chorus of speeches which have been made .
i myself live near the danish-german border .
this is not only the border between denmark and germany , but also the border between germany and the other countries of scandinavia .
as a dane , i think it is important to draw attention to this , in these days of europe and schengen .
but haste is one thing and speed another .
although harmonization with the community sphere , particularly for points 1 to 6 of article 1 , is desirable , we should nevertheless consider it point by point and take the necessary precautions .
we must always hold fast to the idea that the european citizen should be at the heart of european integration .
the union has an unconditional obligation to look at its citizens ' needs in practical terms , but also at their concerns .
similarly , there can be no question of creating a european space with no frontiers without the accompanying measures needed to deal with internal security .
measures relating to free movement and those relating to the security of external frontiers should be applied simultaneously .
ladies and gentlemen , for the sake of the well-being and freedom of all citizens of the union , let us avoid ( in the words of a well-known saying ) ' putting the cart before the horse ' .
besides , these same citizens would accept the idea of freedom linked to free movement more enthusiastically if the european decision-maker framed this plan with due allowance for aspects essential to the security of the external frontiers .
let us never forget that security for us all is as much a right as freedom of movement .
madam president , i should also like to thank the council and the commission for the interesting answers .
i should like to begin with baltic cooperation .
it is good that the council supports baltic cooperation so actively .
it is important that this cooperation should become a matter for the whole of the eu ; it is quite likely that the subject will also be discussed further in florence .
as regards the free movement of persons , i believe it is worth stressing that this is something that the single market stands for and is intended to achieve .
this was completely clear both to those who created the single market and to those of us who joined the community later .
this can of course , as has already been pointed out , serve as a good example of how free movement can operate at its best .
because there is both dogma and reality .
the dogma , of course , is expressed in article 7a of the eu treaty , for example .
the reality is the setting up of specific systems like that established for the schengen agreement .
the reality is also the existence of autonomous machinery for regionalized spaces for free movement of persons like that of the nordic passport union .
moreover , we have here a unilateral idea .
i do not think this situation will disappear overnight .
thirdly , the visby conference proved that frameworks for cooperation much wider than those of the european union alone had to be found .
all this clearly shows that it is unreal to pretend that europe should be organized only in the rigid framework of the european union .
faced with this transatlantic world superpower , it will be absolutely essential to find a counterweight some day .
of course , i do not think that russia and the cis can be included in the rigid framework of the european union , but this means that that framework cannot take priority .
other , more flexible , forms of cooperation will have to be set up : this is what is happening gradually under the pressure of necessity .
madam president , it is perfectly understandable of course that the countries of denmark , sweden and finland should be seeking to join the schengen group .
indeed , in the negotiations on accession by norway , which came to naught because of the referendum decision , this was an important consideration .
they would be in a peculiar position because they would find that non-member states were involved in a free movement arrangement which as member states they were not part of .
it is all a very unhappy situation .
i hope that it will not be a permanent difficulty , that one day it may be possible for all the member states of the union to be part of the free movement area .
but it is a reality at the moment that britain and one or two others certainly do not see that happening in the immediate future . and that must be recognized .
in conclusion , some of us may have to abstain on this common text .
the commission is not aware of any provisions in the nordic union agreement which might be incompatible with existing community law or existing european union arrangements .
everything naturally needs to be explored in the new situation which we hope will shortly be created when the abolition of the controls on persons enters into force for the whole of the european union .
some people have stressed the issue of security .
so i would not want anyone to think the commission is so preoccupied with achieving the objective of freedom of movement that it would neglect security . that is certainly not the case .
i have received 11 motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 40 ( 5 ) of the rules of procedure .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
economic and social reform in the mediterranean
madam president , i take the floor with great concern because the union 's credibility is at stake .
but , after all , we are used to this kind of shenanigans .
i am concerned that at this moment the union 's credibility is at stake vis-&agrave;-vis the mediterranean countries because we have approved a euro-mediterranean policy and we must honour our commitments .
our committee 's proposal to refer the issue to the igc has succeeded in unblocking a situation in which the government of one member state has vetoed the situation .
there is the other extreme that we must not forget : the concern with safeguarding and protecting one member state , namely greece .
the resolution which the european parliament has approved concerning the florence summit also mentions this matter and it is also in the treaties .
however , with respect to this and the euromediterranean conference , it is worth making it quite clear .
it is certain that many things were born in greece , not just the euro-mediterranean policy .
there is no doubt that it was at the corfu summit that a boost was given to it , when the commission proposal was accepted despite reservations by the council and the european parliament .
the agreements which we have reached , albeit multilaterally , always imply services in return .
our mediterranean partners have taken a step and now we must in turn we able to face up to our responsibilities and keep to our word .
therefore i think it is important that this regulation be approved once and for all , through consultation , at this plenary session .
madam president , i should like to take the floor very briefly since we already examined this report last november .
first of all , i think that , although this is a fresh consultation , the opinion of the committees on budgets and budgetary control should have been sought , and this was not done .
on the other hand , i should also like to comment that six months have gone by , as the rapporteur said , and yet the issue is still being held up in council .
fourthly , the european parliament - and this too has already been mentioned - has respected for 1996 the sum of 900 million ecu decided at the cannes summit .
yet the execution of the meda budgetary line for this year is still at the starting-point .
we know what the cost of propelling the meda programme has been and we know what is at stake in the area .
this regulation , however , only provides for a consultation of the european parliament .
this means that the european parliament must develop effective instruments so that it can exert control over the application of the programme , as well as proper budgetary management .
madam president , the socialist group supports the report of our rapporteur , enrique bar&oacute;n crespo .
my group campaigned for a mediterranean policy for the eu and insisted on parallelism between our approach to the east and to the south .
the socialist group will support the approach to global meda funding .
but it is fair to give warning that we believe that the government of turkey has yet to deliver on the promises made to this parliament before the ratification of the customs union in december last year .
we know that in the field of democratic reform and human rights abuses the situation has not only stalled but has actually deteriorated since the turkish general election in december .
nor has turkey made any effort to deal with the political problems of cyprus and the kurdish area .
in all these ways turkey is found wanting , and yet it has an exceptionally close relationship with our union and we have a right to expect more .
my group will therefore be looking to use our budgetary powers this autumn to keep up the pressure on turkey .
we have a substantial right as the co-authority on the union 's budget . we intend to use it and to invite other groups to join us .
you are all aware of the problems that turkey is creating for syria , at least as far as water is concerned .
further to that , i would be failing in my duty if i did not emphasize the special relevance that the implementation of the meda programme will have for the middle east peace process .
the four amendments that have been tabled are all , i think , very important .
i will mention just two of them : the amendment concerning the definitive procedure for adopting appropriate measures when such are deemed necessary and the amendment on synergy .
as regards the first of those two , commissioner , i hardly need to say how important it is that the decision on the adoption of appropriate measures must be approved by qualified majority .
in fact , that is what you , and the commission , recommended in your original proposal .
as regards the other amendment , i feel that i should draw attention again to the importance of ensuring transparency in this programme , particularly given the undesirable precedents that have occurred in certain other sectors .
i remind you , commissioner , that you yourself - and i commend you for it - have on many occasions given verbal assurances to committees of the european parliament about the safeguarding of transparency .
to conclude , madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i inform you that my group will be voting in favour , will be supporting the regulation , that is .
this is a neighbouring area , closely linked to us throughout our history , where the lack of resources and demographic growth are now triggering extremely tricky problems .
given this humanitarian , social , economic and political interest we must all have a broad view when it comes to finding the funds needed , while recognising the existing difficulties .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , this report concerns the euro-mediterranean policy which fully illustrates the ultimate wish to communitarize all fields of external policy .
everything proposed here could just as well have been regulated by bilateral agreements , with all the flexibility that such agreements between the various countries around the mediterranean could have given .
it is true that in this case the main objective is perhaps less legitimate cooperation between the different states than the ultimate creation of a kind of enormous free trade area extending over the whole mediterranean basin .
however , in the light of the differing economic structures north and south of the mediterranean , it is not certain that it has to go in this direction without precautions .
we have seen the disastrous consequences for mexico which have followed from the nafta agreements in north america , for example .
there is no need , in this respect , to eliminate the role of member states in this type of cooperation policy .
to sum up - as i think that mr bar&oacute;n has said this very well - we accept what he pointed out .
i share the concerns of the committee on budgets and budgetary control .
i should like to respond to those concerns .
three agreements have already been finalised .
in chronological order they are : tunisia , israel and morocco .
in all cases both parties have agreed upon a free trade zone .
each party has stood up for itself .
one of the main demands of the european union has been precisely the lifting of trade barriers .
this stems from the retrospective clause of 1 january 1996 and has already begun but i cannot go on , as commissioner responsible , receiving more and more visits from the ministers of those countries asking for their share .
in other words , mr bar&oacute;n is right .
this is a problem that goes beyond the financial aspect or technicalities of the meda programme .
but there is a political amendment which i see no reason for the commission to refuse since it has already put it forward at the igc .
over this there is no doubt : the commission is quite against the idea of unanimity .
it is a problem of time .
you might say : what is the link between these ?
many of the tactical positions of the member states are interlinked at this moment in time , and it would only need the principle of qualified majority to be applied just now for some of them to block everything .
as for what was said earlier , i should like to make a few remarks , which might be bad for my health .
i hope that the mad cow miracle will take place in florence and i hope that the meda miracle will also take place .
i hope the igc will get off the ground in florence .
we are expecting so much of florence that i think we might be disappointed .
i should like to make this point : the situation for the committee on budgets and budgetary control has become so schizophrenic that i have to point it out to the european parliament .
the commission and the european parliament reached agreement over financial programming for the next three years .
for this year , the commission and the european parliament reached agreement over a figure : 600 million ecu .
it was the council which increased that amount to 900 million ecu . that is the truth .
it is true , however , that the council has denied us , by various blockages , the legal basis since last november , when the barcelona conference took place .
that is totally schizophrenic and it highlights how rotten this so-called cfsp instrument is .
in other words , the situation is very serious , mr bar&oacute;n .
i am not over-dramatizing .
madam president , i should first of all like to thank commissioner mar&iacute;n for the frankness and clarity of his answer .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on thursday at 12 noon .
workers ' health and safety in explosive atmospheres
madam president , the commission has put forward a basically sound and progressive proposal on improving the health and safety protection of workers who are potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres .
the directive is produced in accordance with the framework directive no 391 / 89 .
it places three main obligations on employers .
firstly , they must prevent the formation of explosive atmospheres .
secondly , they must prevent the ignition of any such atmospheres .
thirdly , they must reduce the effects of explosions to a minimum .
our report from the committee on social affairs and employment insists that employers must treat each of these three obligations as high priorities and observe each of them .
the commission 's purpose in this report balances the need to protect workers with a balanced approach to regulation .
this really is an area where preventative measures can help to safeguard human lives .
in due course this sign - if i may show it to colleagues in the chamber - will signify the presence of explosive atmospheres .
this black and yellow warning will help protect workers from unexpected explosive atmospheres and warn them to take care in those environments .
the directive is also necessary because in some member states regulation is non-existent or at best rudimentary .
the commission 's set of minimum standards is an effective one .
it is important to note that the consultative process on which the commission embarked was both thorough and exhaustive and this has lent credibility to their conclusions .
the committee has drawn again on ecosoc opinions written by the workers ' group representative there to strengthen the proposals in the directive .
these are a few general points about the report and i look forward to hearing the observations of colleagues and of the commissioner .
madam president , commissioner , i will begin roughly where the rapporteur left off .
and that is not the only point on which assent is forthcoming from this side .
we believe , commissioner , that the amendments , as finally formulated after exhaustive but quite easy discussion in our committee , from which many compromise positions emerged , genuinely improve the regulation .
in addition , i believe that the implementation timetable in our proposal strikes a good compromise between the immediate future and the time that undertakings actually need to adjust to the new equipment .
on behalf of my group i can inform you that we shall be very happy to vote for mr mather 's report .
madam president , mr flynn , in businesses and factories in europe there are often no instructions at all about how to handle explosive atmospheres , or at best they exist only in rudimentary form .
an explosive atmosphere is a highly inflammable mixture of air and flammable substances , and constitutes a potential danger to workers .
therefore there is a need for a european directive .
organizational measures and technical specifications should be laid down in order to improve protection for workers ' health and to ensure greater safety .
graham mather has done some excellent work here on behalf of the committee on social affairs and employment .
what are the principles to be observed in order to avoid explosions and provide adequate protection ?
the formation of explosive atmospheres must be prevented .
the igniting of explosive atmospheres must be avoided .
the effects of explosions must be limited so that they no longer constitute a hazard .
by observing each separate principle , the necessary protection can be achieved .
rooms in factories should be divided up into various zones , depending on the level of risk .
employers must be aware of their duty to inform and involve their employees and their representatives , and to listen in good time to what they have to say .
in order to provide equality of opportunity for small and medium-sized enterprises , this directive must be implemented within a reasonable time .
last but not least , a vade-mecum should be drawn up , in agreement with the council , in order to explore the options for putting the minimum requirements into practice .
our unanimity within the committee on social affairs and employment certainly sends a positive signal to workers , and also to the commission and the council .
madam president , the commission 's proposal regarding the minimum requirements for the protection of workers potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres is absolutely vital .
far too many workers have been injured in explosions and far too many workers have died in explosions .
stringent safety measures are required to prevent explosions .
detailed regulations are also required in order to minimize the damages caused , if explosions occur despite safety measures .
mr mather pointed out in committee that regulation is required .
it has been mentioned that the report was accepted unanimously by the committee .
i did indeed vote for the report in the final vote , but i could not support all of mr mather 's proposals , which unfortunately were accepted by the majority of the committee .
on many issues it would have been better to rely on the commission 's expertise , instead of proposing apparent amendments .
these amendments do not however change the situation so much that it would be dangerous if they were accepted .
on the whole i congratulate mr mather on this report .
first of all i should like to express my thanks to you , mr mather , for the remarkably good job you have done on this very technical matter .
the commission is prepared to accept the majority of the proposed amendments , in total or in part .
let me start with the four amendments which we find are not acceptable to the commission : amendments nos 6 , 9 , 10 and 12 .
amendment no 6 is unacceptable to the commission since article 9 covers requirements on both workplaces and work equipment .
concerning amendment no 9 the commission considers that it introduces uncertainty regarding the entry into force of the directive .
the commission cannot accept amendment no 10 .
however it would consider modifying its original text by adding the phrase ' and the assessment of the anticipated effects ' in order to bring the text more into line with the iso texts .
secondly , i would like to enumerate the five amendments that are partially acceptable to the commission .
regarding amendment no 2 , the commission feels that the first part of the amendment clarifies the text of the commission 's proposal and therefore it can be accepted .
so the last paragraph of the amendment cannot be accepted since it adds nothing to what has already been laid down in article 4 ( 4 ) of the proposal and article 6 of framework directive 89 / 391 .
as a consequence it should be complemented with the words : ' by the commission ' .
madam president , i wish to thank commissioner flynn for what he said and , indeed , all my colleagues for their remarks , which have been most helpful .
as the commissioner said , this is a very technical measure indeed and the points which have arisen show that .
the committee , as mr papakyriazis said , has spent a great deal of time and paid enormous attention to detail .
i am most grateful for that and for the comments of my colleague , thomas mann .
i must say a word in response to mrs stenius-kaukonen , who gave me a slightly mixed score on the amendments .
they are , indeed , stringent and , as my witness , i would call the commissioner who , in his comments , observed that a number of the measures were slightly too stringent for the commission 's taste .
so perhaps i am not stringent enough for mrs stenius-kaukonen and a little too stringent for the commissioner . i hope the report is therefore pitched about right .
thank you once again for a debate which i hope will be helpful .
we look forward to taking this very important subject further .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
protection of workers against carcinogens
madam president , in this proposal by the commission the objective is to set an occupational limit values for exposure to benzene , extend the scope of the directive and clarify the wording of two clauses in the directive .
this amendment is a clear improvement of the directive .
extension of the scope of this directive is particularly important , since it brings medicinal preparations , cosmetics , waste , fertilizers , explosives and foodstuffs into the remit of the directive .
the choice of benzene as the first substance for which a limit value is proposed is justified , because benzene exposure is extremely widespread and its tolerance risks clearly stated .
benzene exposure occurs for example in oil refineries , in connection with petrol transport and distribution , that is at service stations and garages , and in the petrochemical industry .
users of power saws may also be exposed to benzene .
the committee on social affairs proposes 16 amendments .
the european parliament has already demanded that limit values be set for all carcinogens .
this has however not been implemented .
the commission has already drawn up a priority list of substances for which limit values should subsequently be set .
the committee considers it important that limit values are also set for heavy metals without delay , and proposes that arsenic and certain arsenic compounds should top the priority list .
a considerable weakness in the commission 's proposal is that skin absorption has not sufficiently been taken into account .
although the consequences of skin absorption are highlighted in the report , no biological measurements are mentioned in the directive , nor any limit values .
in its report the committee requests that the concept of biological limit value is defined and that the commission should present the biological tolerance limits for benzene without delay .
the definition of limit values in the report is taken from the commission 's proposal for a directive on chemical substances .
the committee on social affairs and employment recommends that the definition for limit values as a concept is clarified .
in the commission 's proposal the spatial measurements area is regulated using the expression ' the employee 's breathing area ' .
legislation should make a clear distinction between two concepts , the air of the workplace and the breathing air of the employee .
exceeding this value would be prohibited .
the committee 's report also recommends that a common measuring practice is created for defining limit values for benzene content .
if the concept of limit values is defined in the form presented by the committee , there are no grounds for granting provisional exceptions as suggested by the commission .
they are not satisfactory as legislation .
they are also in contravention of the health and safety regulations .
if the proposal of the committee on social affairs and employment is accepted , that is the exceptions are removed , there is no need for amendments nos 18 and 19 proposed by the committee on the environment .
it should be emphasized that benzene is considered to be a substance for which no limit value can be set beneath which there would be no health risks .
decrease in exposure however also decreases the risks .
the limit value of 1 ppm proposed by the commission may , if exposed to over a working life , cause 0.5-6.6 more cases of leukemia per 1000 workers .
this involves a too great a risk , and therefore this limit value should be gradually lowered .
the committee on the environment has proposed a limit value of 0.1 ppm by the beginning of year 2001 , and i myself put this proposal forward to the committee on social affairs , but it was not accepted .
i now propose a compromise of 0.5 ppm by the beginning of year 2003 , and hope that at least this could be accepted .
the benzene content can be lowered mainly by reducing the amount of benzene in petrol , and the commission has today put forward a proposal , but i do not find it adequate .
i would like to thank the commission for their willingness to co-operate , and i am happy that ireland will bring this issue to the council for consideration as soon as their period of presidency begins .
madam president , the opinion of the committee on the environment is not very different from that of the committee on social affairs and employment .
our task will be easier as a result , but i should like to draw attention to a few aspects of this proposal for a directive .
fixing limit values for benzene is also a good thing .
what is less good is the fixing of the limit value at one part per million , that is , 3.25 mg per m3 on average over eight hours .
the derogation is unacceptable .
it is entirely possible to limit the working time if , in the short term , it is technically impossible to prevent a worker who works eight hours from getting an exposure of more than one part per million .
thus , the short term solution is to reduce his hours of work .
another solution would be to reduce the benzene content of fuels .
we know that the united states tolerates only 1 % of benzene in petrol , while europe accepts a maximum of 5 % .
quite clearly therefore the need would be to make a major effort in that direction rather than to grant derogations which will only confirm an existing situation .
mrs stenius-kaukonen has produced an insightful and thorough report which has been done practically through hard work in our committee .
she knows that i accept nearly everything that she has done , and we in the socialist group will accept the entire committee 's report as it was voted .
i have a particular direct question to put to the commissioner on the limit values which have been set by the commission at 1 ppm .
we accept them as being those which the industry can attain and can afford .
i do not believe it offers the hope of saving more lives , because i do not think in the short term that this will be achieved , but the possibility of the destruction of many small businesses .
millions become ill each year in work-related illnesses and this report will have a direct effect on reducing that industrial carnage and misery .
that is why we need this report to succeed and we should underline any significant achievements and support them where they occur .
it is easy perhaps to dismiss it saying that we have not gone all the way down the line but we know that 5 ppm exists at the moment .
to come down to 1 ppm is a significant achievement .
i apologize for using the jargon but it is good solid progress .
i hope that all my colleagues in the house , wherever they might be tonight , will take a pragmatic and sincere approach to this problem in tomorrow 's vote .
i warn anyone who thinks that he can play fast and loose with this kind of report that the gloves will come off .
the challenge is here to achieve a limit which has never been achieved before , and it is within our grasp to do it .
i want the report to be a success .
let there be no difference between us and the commission on this issue .
we want to return this jointly to the council and we want the council to accept our opinion .
madam president , i should like to begin by congratulating mrs stenius-kaukonen , the rapporteur , on her report .
this is a field about which she knows a great deal and which she understands thoroughly .
i regard the amendments to the commission 's proposal which are proposed in the report and the amendments by the greens as a necessary tightening up of the commission proposal .
it is of course extremely good that the commission has tabled this proposal and that we are going to have a limit value .
however , i must at the same time express my regret that limit values have not also been set for all the other substances that have also been found to be highly carcinogenic .
it would be preferable for as many of these substances as possible to be got rid of and for limit values to be established for all those which we absolutely have to have .
the limit values should also be binding , with a maximum permissible level which may not be exceeded .
in this connection the commission proposal should be formulated in such a way that there can be no ambiguity and no possibility of it being interpreted in different ways .
i also believe it would be regrettable if the directive did not at this stage already lay down a considerably lower limit , exactly as the rapporteur has proposed .
it would be a pity if this compromise were to be reached , that is to say 0.1 ppm by the year 2000 .
after all , there are already countries which have in fact decided to implement it .
i do not therefore believe that it would be so impossible .
nor can the greens accept that an exception be made of the petrol sector , that is to say its storage and distribution , with a limit value of 3 ppm .
we will of course support this proposal but only with the amendments which the greens have also tabled .
madam president , cancer is a serious disease among the population .
it severely affects many people , and claims many human lives .
leukaemia is one of the most serious forms of cancer ; we know from countless studies that there is a link between exposure to benzene and leukaemia .
it is therefore extremely welcome that the commission is now seeking to introduce a higher degree of protection for workers .
there is a need for a directive on carcinogens , and for the scope of the current directive to be extended to include medicinal preparations , cosmetics and pesticides .
we should do what is politically and humanly possible to limit cancer and protect workers , and this can only be done by taking preventive measures .
so i do not think that introducing biological limit values is a good idea .
we should ensure that the working conditions as a whole are satisfactory , so that there is no reason to take measurements for individuals .
if we go that far , there is already a risk that people will have become ill .
we should measure for the workplace , and not for individuals .
the limit values should not stand alone , and we must take care not to focus exclusively on limit values .
the other measures in the framework directive should be given higher priority , and there needs to be an overall solution , providing for a safer working environment in general .
we must not allow any kind of dangerous substances or machinery in an undertaking .
if a substance is dangerous , it should be replaced by another .
i would therefore ask the commission to step up the work in the scientific committee .
things are moving far too slowly as regards the study of the various carcinogens .
there is a disgraceful lack of speed about this work , mr flynn .
it is not enough simply to check that the limit values are respected .
in some work situations , even the proposed limit value of 0.1 ppm would be too high .
the workplace should be completely safe and free of risk .
that should be our starting-point .
and lastly , i would commend the rapporteur on what is an excellent report .
madam president , i should like to thank mrs stenius-kaukonen for her good work on this proposal and for her support of the commission for some time in the fight against occupational cancers .
the commission appreciates it very much as i do personally .
the objectives of the commission proposal are quite simple .
firstly , we want to extend the scope of the directive to a whole series of preparations which the rapporteur has mentioned , such as medicinal preparations , cosmetics and pesticides .
secondly , for the first time we want to set an occupational limit value for a well-known carcinogen , namely benzene .
i am pleased to say that the majority of the amendments proposed are acceptable to the commission .
however , i regret that amendments nos 11 , 14 and 15 cannot be accepted .
these call for the deletion of the temporary derogations for selective sectors of activities as far as the limit value for benzene is concerned .
these derogations , which were agreed by the social partners in the advisory committee , are necessary to ensure a little more time for some industrial sectors to comply with the provisions of the directive .
the commission accepts that these derogations are necessary .
obviously it would be ideal if all sectors were in a position to meet the revised requirements immediately . however , in the case of these sectors it is simply not possible .
it is important to note that the derogations are restricted both with respect to the number of industrial sectors concerned and in time .
thus the derogation will expire two years after the transposition by the member state .
the commission is ready to consider any proposal for a reduction of the time limit for benzene in the future .
the figures included in the present text , as i have already said , are the result of a comprehensive consultation with the advisory committee for safety , hygiene and health protection at work .
any further reduction could be part of a further updating of the directive in the future .
mr skinner is right : this is real progress and he states the position correctly so far as limit values are concerned .
there are countries with the 5 ppm situation in existence so going down to 1 ppm is considerable progress .
mr skinner was quite right in what he said .
for this reason , amendments nos 17 and 20 cannot be accepted .
for that reason the commission cannot accept them .
the commission considers that amendment no 10 is not appropriate to the text .
it is superfluous , given the provisions of the framework directive 89 / 391 from which the current text is derived .
the commission can understand the basis for amendments nos 3 and 4 .
these require simplification for setting limit values for carcinogens and ask for a plan on how to set up these values as quickly as possible for all carcinogens .
however , the simplification of the process involved not only included the commission but also the social partners and the council .
as far as amendment no 4 is concerned , adequate scientific data is not available .
that is a key point and many of you will understand this , in particular the rapporteur .
it is not available just now for all carcinogens .
however , the commission would like to assure the house that when the data is available it will not hesitate to act .
in addition , amendments nos 3 and 4 which refer to the recitals have no legal follow-up in the text of the decision .
this applies also to amendment no 7 .
i consider that it would , therefore , be preferable to take note sympathetically of the ideas in these amendments without commitment at this point as to how we might put the principles into practice .
amongst the amendments which are acceptable , i would in particular like to express my agreement with amendment no 16 which requires a uniform , measuring procedure for benzene .
the commission will find the appropriate wording to include that particular idea in the text .
i should like to thank all those who have contributed and say that we regard it as an extremely important amendment to directive no 90 / 394 .
i am happy to say that the matter has been given priority by the irish presidency and i sincerely hope we can progress it further in the immediate future .
i should like to thank you in my turn , commissioner flynn .
mrs stenuis-kaukonen , you wish to comment ?
the exceptions are not in my opinion necessary , not even for the two years proposed by the commission , but the commission has its own view on this and i hope that parliament takes a different view .
this would speed up these issues considerably .
it was said here today that it had taken too long to set these limit values .
i would like to remind you of the fact that several years ago now parliament put forward measures on these issues .
on the whole , as i said before , i would like to thank the commission for its co-operation on this issue and hope that we can now move forward .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
( the sitting was closed at 11.35 p.m. )
approval of the minutes
the minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
madam president , i notice there are a lot of roll-call votes accompanying the minutes .
i notice that yesterday you did not tell us who had asked for the roll-call votes .
it might help if today 's minutes showed the average cost of one of those and possibly , by extension , the amount of trees we consume in a year , often for quite frivolous reasons .
i have made a note of what you have said .
each time , however , the minutes did record which group had made the request .
and i have now made due note of your comment .
are there any other comments ?
the next item is the presentation by the european ombudsman of his annual report for 1995 .
madam president , distinguished members of the european parliament , i should like to begin by thanking you for creating time in a busy parliamentary schedule for the ombudsman to present his report .
by establishing the practice that the ombudsman presents his report in person , the european parliament is following the best parliamentary traditions of those member states that have established a classic ombudsman institution .
i am convinced that this practice will prove beneficial in terms of our common ideals of an open and democratic european union .
i would also like to draw attention to the serious and dedicated attitude that i have observed in the committee on petitions and in parliament as a whole towards the rights of european citizens .
this is a promising sign for a fruitful and effective cooperation between the ombudsman and the european parliament , especially the committee on petitions , to the benefit of the european citizens .
this is the first annual report by the european ombudsman .
furthermore you have the opportunity to make observations on my report as well as on the report of the committee on petitions .
this will be of great value to me in my future work .
there have been voices saying that the ombudsman 's office has not achieved results .
my annual report covers only a short period from september 1995 , when i took up my duties , to december 1995 .
the report also includes statistics about complaints up to the end of march .
since then the situation has changed considerably .
my office has now been active in producing decisions and solutions .
as of yesterday my office had received a total of 647 complaints .
an examination of admissibility had already been completed in 599 cases , that is in over 90 % of the cases .
in 132 cases a preliminary inquiry has been initiated .
16 inquiries have been closed , 6 with a favourable solution for the complainant , 1 with a critical remark addressed to the institution .
in one instance the complainant dropped the case and in 8 cases no instance of maladministration was found .
my office was only able to start the work with the complainants at full speed from the beginning of this year .
the institution in question is usually given three months to comment on the complaint .
this time limit is mentioned in the statute .
after that the complainant has one month to react to what the institution has said .
only last month , therefore , did it become possible to take further action in the first cases .
there has also been criticism of the high number of inadmissible cases .
you have to remember that the mandate ' maladministration in community institutions and bodies ' is a limited one .
only about 40 % of the complaints are within the mandate .
the statute of the european ombudsman contains additional requirements before i can investigate the complaint .
the limited mandate given by the treaty and the further restrictions in the statute which parliament has laid down for me explains why only about 20 % of complaints reach the stage of an inquiry .
i am bound to act in accordance with these provisions .
the procedures of work and statistics are presented in the annual report .
i am sure that the figures will be much more favourable in the next annual report .
article 8 ( d ) of the treaty establishing the european community creates two important rights for the european citizens , namely the right to petition the european parliament and the right to complain to the european ombudsman .
citizens enjoy both these rights and it is for them to choose whether to address a petition to parliament or apply to the ombudsman .
however , it may not always be obvious to the citizen which course of action is more appropriate .
for this reason my office and the committee on petitions have cooperated closely to clarify our respective functions and to establish methods of cooperation .
there is a procedure for the transfer of cases between the committee on petitions and the ombudsman with the agreement of the petitioner or complainant .
the ombudsman does not , as a rule , deal with a matter pending before the committee on petitions unless the committee transfers it to the ombudsman .
nor does the ombudsman deal with cases that have been examined and dealt with by the committee unless there are relevant new elements that justify recourse to the ombudsman .
complaints about decisions of the committee on petitions itself are considered inadmissible since its decisions , like those of parliament , are political matters .
the right to petition created by the treaty is a right to petition the european parliament .
the committee on petitions acts on its behalf .
it is for parliament to supervise the work of its own committee and , for example , to make sure that the committee 's resources are adequate to perform the tasks entrusted to it .
the mandate of the committee on petitions and the ombudsman are different and complementary .
together they constitute a unique possibility to promote the rights of the european citizens .
my experience of cooperation with the committee on petitions has been very positive .
i am ready to monitor the established procedure for cooperation .
i look for ways to enhance cooperation in favour of the rights of the european citizen .
the ombudsman himself should act in as transparent a way as possible so that the european citizens can fully understand what he does and to set a good example to others .
for this reason it has been decided that the register of complaints is to be open to the public .
the complaint , the first opinion from the institutional body as well as the decision that finally closes this complaint will also be publicly available .
the inquiries following the first opinion from an institutional body are carried out in private , however , so as to ensure full cooperation and to promote a friendly solution in the case .
the complainant 's right to privacy must be respected .
if confidentiality is requested then the complaint and all the documents relating to it are treated as confidential .
the entry on the register , the decision that finally closes the complaint as well as any report or recommendations to the european parliament will be made anonymous so that the complainant cannot be identified .
but the ombudsman should do more than just seek transparency in his own office .
part of his mission is to enhance the relationship between the community institutions and bodies and european citizens .
the creation of the office was meant to underline the commitment of the european union to an open , democratic and accountable administration .
the need for transparency in the union is emphasized by mrs ahern in her report and by the committee on petitions in its motion for a resolution .
during my first months in office i have received a number of complaints concerning public access to documents held by community institutions and bodies .
the commission and council have already issued a code of conduct about public access to documents they hold .
but i have no information that any other community institutional body has adopted general rules on public access to documents .
i have therefore launched an initiative by asking the other community institutions and bodies to inform me about the position in respect of public access to documents .
the initiative covers all institutions and bodies except the council and commission .
for example , it covers parliament , the court of justice but only in relation to administrative documents , the court of auditors , the european investment bank and the european monetary institute .
i hope that this initiative will be well received and that it will lead to more transparency in these institutions and bodies .
creating a new office takes time .
so far the establishment of the office of the european ombudsman has proceeded relatively smoothly .
that is in large part because of the helpful and cooperative attitude shown by the european parliament and its administration , by the commission and the council and by the other community institutions and bodies .
the proportion of inadmissible complaints i have received is relatively high .
european citizens need time and information to understand what the ombudsman can and cannot do .
for this reason , a leaflet about how to complain to the european ombudsman has been published .
it includes a standard form on which the complaint can be made .
the leaflet is being widely distributed through the national offices of parliament and the commission , the offices of the national ombudsmen and similar bodies and through a large number of organizations involved in european affairs .
since last week the text of the leaflet is also available on the internet .
there is nothing unusual about inadmissible complaints .
ombudsmen at all levels receive many of them .
whenever i am unable to deal with a complaint , i try to advise the complainant to go to another body which can help .
very often the advice is to petition the european parliament .
in some cases it is appropriate to refer complainants to the commission as the guardian of the treaties .
the commission 's own complaints procedure has great potential to help european citizens to protect their rights under community law when national authorities are involved .
i hope that this important activity of the commission will become better known to the public .
finally , i attach great importance to cooperation with national ombudsmen and similar bodies .
such cooperation in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity will be of great importance in promoting the full implementation of community law at all levels of the union .
a seminar is being organized next september here in strasbourg to discuss with them the principles for such cooperation and to agree on common activities in the future .
the work of the european ombudsman is only one element in the process for ensuring that european citizens enjoy the benefits of an open , democratic and accountable administration .
the ombudsman 's office can succeed only if the community institutions and bodies are firmly committed both to these principles and to the full cooperation with the ombudsman .
from my experience so far i believe that this commitment exists .
i look forward with confidence to continuing to develop a partnership with the other community institutions and bodies to protect the rights of european citizens .
madam president and members of the european parliament , thank you for your attention .
( loud applause )
annual report of the ombudsman ( debate )
the treaty on european union created this new office of ombudsman of the european union and it ensures that the new body can autonomously defend citizens against maladministration in the union institutions and bodies .
the ombudsman is nevertheless a parliamentary ombudsman and his presence here today is an indication of that .
he is appointed by parliament , he reports to parliament and he cooperates , of course , with parliament , and we want parliament very much to cooperate with him .
in particular , we welcome his powers to investigate : it is a useful protection for the people of europe against maladministration in the council , the commission and parliament itself .
people have rightly said that the institutions are closed , elitist and impenetrable to the citizens .
the challenge now for the ombudsman is to shake up the commission , the council and , indeed , parliament , so that the closed shop of the european union institutions can become open for anyone to see .
the european union is a complex of opposing tendencies .
the conflict between the idea of europe as a collaboration of sovereign states and the ideal of a federal europe has retarded the development of modern , democratic and citizen-friendly european union institutions .
if we are to create such democratic institutions , the next step is to make access to information an explicit commitment of the institutions , along the lines of the code of conduct concerning access to documents .
in this report before you today we have asked you to endorse this explicit commitment from the institutions and see that it is carried out .
we already have a commitment by mrs gradin , the commissioner responsible , that she will pursue this very strongly during the intergovernmental conference .
the committee on petitions is the parliamentary organ to which the ombudsman submits his reports and which needs to establish a complementary working relationship in view of their various responsibilities on petitions and complaints of the citizens .
in practice , this means an additional role for the committee in overseeing the functions of the ombudsman in relation to parliament .
i now wish to comment more on his report .
the first part of the report is particularly useful since it explains the conditions in which a complaint can be introduced and the procedural decisions taken by the ombudsman for dealing with complaints .
about what ?
a definition of maladministration is wisely not attempted .
i am sure that we shall have very interesting reports in due course as to exactly what constitutes maladministration when the ombudsman reports concretely to us on issues that he has not been able to resolve .
of course , his ability to resolve complaints by mediation is an important aspect of his work .
the procedure followed : complaints declared admissible and prima facie founded are communicated to the institution or body in question , which is asked to give a first opinion .
once this has been considered , together with any comments by the complainant , a solution is sought between the two parties .
the power of the ombudsman to conduct own-initiative inquiries is the key to the opening up of the institutions .
for example , he may look into the files of yourself , madam president , mr santer , president h&auml;nsch , any member of parliament or member of the commission , as he sees fit .
this form of inquiry may acquire far greater importance in the years to come to the benefit of the democratic functioning of the union and , therefore , of parliament and citizens .
to conclude , we hope that the special cooperation which we have established with the ombudsman will continue in the years to come .
madam president , mr ombudsman , madam rapporteur , as the treaty states , the ombudsman 's annual report is made to parliament .
the commission has also had an opportunity to reply to the requests for information concerning complaints querying the commission 's administration or its day-to-day running .
on behalf of the commission i think i can say that the commission has replied without holding anything back , in a spirit of transparency and respecting the prerogatives of every institution .
rest assured that we shall remedy the shortcomings you have pointed out in your report , which we think in fact will be an easy mater .
madam president , on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists i want to congratulate the european ombudsman , mr s&ouml;derman , on his excellent first report .
i also want to congratulate the committee on petitions ' vice-chair and rapporteur , mrs ahern , on her excellent report on behalf of the committee .
the ombudsman has proved to be a serious , assiduous and determined person committed to protecting the rights of the people of the european union .
an excellent working relationship has already developed over the past months between mr s&ouml;derman and myself , who at the moment hold the office of chair of the committee on petitions .
i am sure such a relationship will continue with any future chair as well .
the committee on petitions is , as has been said , the committee responsible both for relations with the european ombudsman and for monitoring the work of the european ombudsman .
the european ombudsman is independent and so we , as the petitions committee , do not interfere in the ongoing investigations of complaints .
when in future the committee gets reports of maladministration relating to the outcome of individual complaints we will discuss them with interest .
we welcome his initiative to call for greater access to public documentation of european union organizations .
the work of the european ombudsman and the petitions committee is complementary .
turning to the amendments , the socialist group will be opposing all the amendments because we think the report is excellent as it stands .
mr pex 's amendments in particular are not helpful and were rightly rejected by the petitions committee .
they turn a report on the ombudsman 's report into a report on relations between the ombudsman and the petitions committee .
in particular amendment no 4 encourages the ombudsman to challenge decisions of the petitions committee taken on so-called improper grounds .
how are we to decide if members of the petitions committee have taken a decision on improper grounds ?
presumably , if a member disagrees with a majority decision of his colleagues or if he is too busy elsewhere to take part in a decision of the committee with which he disagrees .
he can be assisted by the democratically elected representatives of the people in ensuring that his work in combating maladministration in the european community is supported strongly .
madam president , on behalf of the european people 's party i too am pleased to congratulate mr s&ouml;derman on his first report to parliament and mrs ahern on her report .
the post of european ombudsman is one of the most valuable and least controversial fruits of the treaty of maastricht .
it is important that the institutions of the union serve the european citizen and not the other way around .
that is what makes the post of ombudsman so valuable .
citizens need to know there is someone , a real human being , who will take their side if bureaucracy threatens to ignore the rights of the citizen .
experienced parliamentarians in this house will have no difficulty in understanding the concept of maladministration and will easily know what is the ombudsman 's sphere of responsibility .
meps will appreciate the different responsibilities of national ombudsmen , the european ombudsman and the committee on petitions .
mr s&ouml;derman referred to his pamphlet , ' how to complain to the european ombudsman ' .
in terms of simplicity and colourfulness , i give this a mark of 2 out of 10 . i have received tax demands that are more colourful and more inspiring than this document .
do we not have anybody within the european community , better graphic artists , who could give the boost that is needed to bring this down to a personal level ?
to turn to mrs ahern 's report , i welcome amendment no 1 , which refers to the use of new technology to apply to the ombudsman .
we need to make use of modern and easy means of communication , but please do not make that an excuse for having dismal paper means for publicising and contacting the ombudsman .
cooperation , communication between the ombudsman and the petitions committee , is also very important if we are to protect more fully our citizens ' rights .
in that respect i believe amendments nos 2 , 3 and 4 help the report by underlining the complementary role of ombudsman and petitions committee .
i would add that this house , as one of the institutions of the european community , should certainly not be shy of allowing the ombudsman to investigate our procedures .
madam president , i should also like to express my thanks for the ombudsman 's activity report and the report by mrs ahern .
i shall now turn to the amendments , the budget and the question of the office in brussels .
we can support amendments nos 1 , 2 , 4 and 5 .
i am not sure if these are particularly necessary , but on the other hand they do no harm .
as for amendment no 3 , i am sorry that the conservative group has not made the amendment somewhat clearer .
when it comes to the budget , the ombudsman has of course like everyone else had some tough discussions with the committee on budgets .
as regards the office in brussels , the discussions will be resumed .
those two features give this document a basically pedagogic role , as the ombudsman was no doubt aware when he was drafting it .
everything shows , madam president , that this new parliamentary institution set up in the maastricht agreements , has started off in the right direction .
this is an important step towards the concept of european citizenship and also a way of guaranteeing transparency and the proper functioning of the institutions of our european administration .
i think it important to explain to europe 's citizens when it is appropriate to approach the ombudsman and when to approach the committee on petitions .
that is something we should all try to do and that is why the greens are completely in favour of and will be voting for this report .
madam president , i too would like to congratulate the ombudsman on this first report .
admittedly , three months is far too short a period to draw up an initial balance sheet for what is a completely new activity for our institutions .
that leaves , mr s&ouml;derman , the massive problem of informing the public , creating public awareness , of this new institution whose work you are pioneering today .
this seems to me to be the most important factor .
first , a suggestion .
would you not agree that we could make things easier for those who want to apply to you by enabling them to do so through the channels provided by the new technologies ?
my group has tabled an amendment to that effect , and i hope honourable members will support it .
i believe that by enabling citizens and residents of the union to address the ombudsman telematically we shall make it easier for them , in practice , to exercise their rights .
it would be a step forward - an advance .
however , the institution of an ombudsman and his recognition have a very important part to play in the emergence of that european citizenship which is so close to our hearts .
now , you have a leading part to play .
remember that you are the first ombudsman , and that as such it is up to you to give that fine institution its initial image .
however , mr s&ouml;derman , we have no doubt that you are fully aware of that responsibility .
i am particularly pleased by the close cooperation that is developing between the ombudsman and parliament 's committee on petitions .
even so , there is one question i would like to raise which is of the greatest interest to me : where is the ombudsman going to exercise his function ?
at the time of his election , mr s&ouml;derman clearly stated his intention of basing his secretariat in strasbourg , the seat of the european parliament .
this decision was in line with the spirit of the treaties .
so , as i know that mr s&ouml;derman is to give a press conference very shortly , i would like to know whether this step really does form part of his intentions and what the reasons for it are .
in his opinion the ombudsman and his office can succeed in this only if the community 's bodies and institutions are totally committed to these principles and to co-operation with the ombudsman .
having read these documents i conclude that the ombudsman believes that such a commitment has already been made , even though his term of office is still too short to make a reasoned assessment .
the european ombudsman deals particularly with maladministration .
from this point of view he has the opportunity to bring his influence to bear on the development of sound administration .
the annual activity report clearly states how the ombudsman 's office works and what citizens should do if they want to take matters to the ombudsman for consideration .
the ombudsman 's policy of advising and guiding citizens is positive and especially important during the first stages of a new institution .
the proposal of the rapporteur concerning widespread distribution of the annual activity report in the member states should be supported .
the guidebook written by the ombudsman serves the same purpose .
it is excellent news that the guidebook has been published so soon , and its content is in my view good .
i would also like to point out that the activity report reflects the ombudsman 's search for co-operation .
an absolute precondition for reliability is that the ombudsman in his activity is independent . despite this , co-operation is also required .
parliament should support the ombudsman in his work .
i would like to congratulate the committee and thank the ombudsman for his valuable efforts .
madam president , the ombudsman mr jacob s&ouml;derman 's first annual activity report is , as mrs ahern points out in her report , most interesting and informative .
the annual report should definitely be circulated as widely as possible , since it includes a clear description of the area of authority of the european ombudsman and thus forms an important source of information for all citizens .
' to be distributed to all citizens . the guidebook has been published in all community languages , and is available both at the national ombudsmen 's offices and at community offices .
increased information will rapidly lead to more complaints .
this is a fact that should be taken into consideration when resources are allocated .
from the point of view of legal protection it is essential that the complainant receives a reply within a reasonable time .
therefore the ombudsman 's office should have personnel in proportion to the amount of complaints .
the ombudsman 's office is located in strasbourg , but the ombudsman hopes to get an additional office , with staff , in brussels .
the statistics concerning complaints from march 1996 shows that of 86 complaints taken up for consideration 78 concerned the european commission .
it would therefore seem natural to have the ombudsman 's office in brussels , even if parliament 's official domicile is strasbourg .
the first annual activity report suggests that good results will be achieved in both areas .
madam president , i agree that the ombudsman 's report is important .
i think , though , that his initiative to promote transparency is not enough to solve the problems that could compromise the importance of his action vis-&agrave;-vis european citizens .
the first aspect concerns limitations stemming from the treaty .
indeed , the ombudsman has no powers to assess those acts of member states that are tantamount to maladministration of community law .
the second aspect concerns the public visibility of the ombudsman , mr s&ouml;derman , and his linkage with national ombudsmen and national parliaments .
the people of our countries must be able to see that there is an ombudsman and that he can receive their complaints .
this is vital .
madam president , i think that democracy in the european union was improved and its citizens ' rights safeguarded when it was decided in the maastricht treaty to create the european ombudsman as an institution .
with the appointment by the european parliament of mr s&ouml;derman from finland , i believe we have chosen very much the right man for the job .
mr s&ouml;derman has only been in office for a short while . he has dealt with 131 of the 298 complaints which he received in 1995 .
it is essential for our citizens to be aware of the ombudsman 's existence , and i therefore fully support the rapporteur 's proposal for the ombudsman 's report to be distributed widely .
finally , i would call on all the eu institutions and others to show respect for the ombudsman , and to demonstrate all the willingness to cooperate which is needed for his work .
madam president , i , too , wish to thank and congratulate mr s&ouml;derman .
i congratulate him for presenting us , initially in the committee on petitions and now here , with a report which is painstaking , comprehensive , analytic and helpful .
i must not forget also to mention the important contribution of mrs ahern , our rapporteur , in presenting us with her report which we approved unanimously in the committee on petitions .
i venture to describe this report , in a word , as historic , because it is the first report submitted to the european parliament by the first european ombudsman .
the institution is totally consistent with and fundamental to the ideal of the european union ; because , in the final analysis , it is the european union that concerns us , rather than the individual institutions .
i , also , agree that , for these reasons , the institution must be given publicity and made more widely known .
not as a pretext for boosting our prestige , but in order that we can demonstrate convincingly that we are fighting for full democracy in the european union .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 12 noon .
traffic in radioactive substances
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , in presenting this report today i have come to the end of a very major undertaking .
i drew up this report following a communication from the commission on the illicit traffic in radioactive substances and nuclear materials in the european union .
let me say from the outset that the commission report is incomplete .
it is tendentious and does not match up to the real threat posed by illicit traffic in nuclear materials in the european union .
for this traffic supposedly and allegedly occurs not just in the european union but worldwide .
my job - and i have considered the question in depth - was to establish what the real situation is .
is it indeed the case that nuclear material is constantly being stolen in all cis and central and eastern european nuclear facilities ?
is it indeed the case that organized crime , terrorists , are those most involved in procuring themselves these nuclear materials ?
is it really the case that there is a flourishing traffic in these materials , which allows organized crime to make a great deal of money ?
the answer is that this may be the case but it is scarcely possible to prove it .
i am saying that from the outset because we must draw a distinction between fact and fiction when we look at the question of illicit traffic in nuclear materials .
we must distinguish between fiction , such as science fiction and thrillers , and the description of fact .
the first area , science fiction , is no doubt more interesting than prosaic fact .
however it is to the latter that i will devote particular attention today .
there are real potential threats that must not be ignored but have to be taken seriously .
but is this so easy to do ?
that is not possible !
who in this chamber , except perhaps mr gmelin , is able to tell plutonium from household dust at a glance ?
what gun-runner , with no scientific knowledge , is in a position to say just like that : ' this is highly enriched , weapons-grade uranium ' ?
who is in a position to set up this kind of deal with the necessary equipment and scientific knowledge ?
that leads to an important insight .
traffic in these materials is only interesting for buyers who really have the necessary technical and scientific know-how for then achieving a certain objective with the material they have bought .
we have to devote particular attention to them , for these interested buyers do exist .
there are of course countries that want to by-pass the non-proliferation treaty and carry out nuclear weapons programmes .
they will of course attempt to procure material for carrying out their illegal nuclear weapons programmes by any means they can .
they may also procure it in the grey area between legal , state action and illegal criminal activity .
the secret services normally operate in that grey area .
let me say that quite plainly !
it would be far easier for a country such as iraq or iran to smuggle such material across the khyber pass than through a german airport .
that brings us to an important fact : this traffic exists !
it exists without any doubt at all in the sphere of the secret services , otherwise countries like pakistan or india would not have been able to gain possession of nuclear weapons after circumventing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty !
yet this traffic probably does not exist in the form described in the commission communication or by member state governments and interested journalists .
of course it is a threat if criminals get hold of plutonium or uranium or terrorist organizations procure themselves these materials in order to threaten the state .
at the same time they are of course the people who know what substances are available and how to handle them and offer them for sale .
that is why we must do our utmost to close down that source .
let the commission explain that .
that is certainly the wrong place to economize .
but we also need a realistic assessment of what is happening .
the institute for transuranium , i.e. , the euratom analysis centre in karlsruhe , has investigated 34 cases of seized nuclear material .
since 1991 the police has seized radioactive material in 34 cases and then handed it over to the institute for transuranium for analysis .
one not so dramatic case was recorded in belgium , 3 cases in italy and 30 cases in the federal republic of germany .
that means that to date not a single seizure of radioactive material has been recorded in 12 member states of the european union .
some of the 30 cases in germany are so dramatic that i want to describe one of them to you .
a suitcase is checked with a geiger counter and the customs officer says : ' it 's registering , this is radioactive ' .
then the case is opened and smoke alarms are found from sprinkler systems in the former gdr .
for some of these alarms were equipped with plutonium in preparation for the nuclear weapons programme .
then the newspaper headlines read : ' more nuclear material find , another case of smuggling !
' some dodgy character has procured these smoke alarm rods , packed a whole lot of them into a suitcase and pretended he had something to sell .
dangerous as it is to ignore a real threat , it is just as dangerous to misrepresent a real threat .
that is why it is urgently necessary for the commission , for us as parliament , but also for the governments of the member states to point out where the real threat lies .
that is totally counterproductive and does not help us really to clarify matters .
the way to clarify matters is to show them as they really are .
i have tried to do so .
but we cannot accept one member state government treating such a serious matter as casually as it has done .
did you really circumvent european law and put several hundred people at risk simply to ensure that your political calculation of what was only an apparently accurate representation of a real threat worked out ?
'
i have tried to present a detailed report on the real threats , together with comprehensive proposals on how to deal with them .
i would ask you to endorse my report and the amendments .
mr president , there can be no doubt that illicit trafficking in radioactive substances and nuclear materials is both wrong and a cause for concern , which this report rightly addresses .
this report contains some very questionable assertions about both scientific and legal matters .
i welcome the amendments brought forward to remove many of them .
most of all i welcome those amendments which remove references to the military stocks and defence competences of eu member states .
not even this report is suggesting that any illicit trafficking originates in the eu in connection with member states ' stocks .
the problem originates outside the eu .
and by the way , that means outside our competence .
so it seems silly to try to link external problems with member state competence in defence and security .
i note in the list of recommendations in the report for action there is a call for the commission to reorganize the internal structure of those of its departments responsible for nuclear matters .
i wonder how many times this call has gone out to the commission for other issues and just what chaos might ensue within the commission if all such suggestions were implemented .
the risk is that parliament will continue to be taken less seriously than it should be and will not gain any additional powers in the igc .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , let me start by saying that i share the opinion of the previous speaker , mr chichester .
in other words , i believe that problems of nuclear defence policy should not be included in this debate , because i am convinced that we can trust the countries that have access to this type of defence .
i am surprised , even so , that it suggested a further communication on 19 april , but i am also glad to see that the concept of radio protection has been introduced into that further communication .
those problems should be the subject of community regulations . moreover , the commission makes a distinction between nuclear materials and radioactive substances - rightly so , because the consequences of the traffic are different .
materials of the first type are uranium , plutonium and thorium .
this traffic causes deferred contamination , by being dispersed into the environment and sometimes even , as has occurred , into the food chain .
remember the notorious contaminated pistachio nuts that were found at the german-polish border .
a campaign of prevention , then , in the form of technical assistance to the former soviet bloc in order to restore effective inspections of installations in the former ussr , is essential .
in that unanimous opinion we state , among other things , that there would naturally be a greater incentive to abolish nuclear weapons if those states which possess such weapons undertook to destroy their own nuclear arsenals .
we also say that all states should naturally refrain from nuclear weapons testing pending international agreement on a total test ban .
as regards nuclear power , we also state that over and above this , bearing in mind the ecological risks entailed in nuclear power , it is the whole way of producing energy which should be changed .
this will be the major task of the next century .
so this was the view taken by a committee which is primarily responsible not for environmental and energy issues but for foreign policy aspects .
i have read with considerable interest the record of attendance for the meeting at which we unanimously backed it .
these include quite a number of members who in other contexts would perhaps have adopted different standpoints .
one must surely be able to assume that members who participated in a unanimous report did not sleep through the entire proceedings but actually support it .
i trust that they will act accordingly in the vote here today too .
mr president , i wish to compliment mr schulz not only on the quality of his report but also on his presentation this morning , which was excellent .
surely the future well-being of the human race is within the competence of this parliament ?
i want to see the world which my granddaughter will inherit handed over in a better form than it is just now .
i believe we should deal with the threats we face .
without any doubt there has been , as mr schulz said , a disturbing and dramatic rise in the number of documented cases of illicit traffic in nuclear materials .
what remains unreported or unknown is anybody 's guess .
but what is clear is that serious questions have to be raised about the effectiveness of international controls over nuclear materials .
i listened very intently to what the commission said in response to the calls for action which mr schulz outlines in his report .
now that is not in the former ussr , it is part of the european union !
i would be extremely interested to know if the commission could provide me with any further update on that situation , primarily because this incident typifies some of the concerns we have about the nuclear industry .
first among these is public information .
a well-informed public is one of the greatest safeguards we could possibly hope for .
so information about storage , transport or processing must be in the public domain .
secondly , this close and dubious relationship between the nuclear and the civil nuclear industries : the very genesis of the civil nuclear industry was in the nuclear industry and the blanket of national security still weighs heavily there .
we should lift that blanket and let some light in .
thirdly , the risks associated with radioactive substances which are not covered by safeguards : there is a case to be made for re-examining the controls over these particular substances .
in conclusion , i plead for more active cooperation between nations and for more stringent and effective international controls in order to contain some of the gravest threats we face .
mr schulz 's report has opened our eyes to some of these threats and we must act on it now .
ladies and gentlemen , the charm of mr schulz 's statements lies in their inconsistency .
in my view his statements today have made this very plain , because he keeps confusing the fire-fighters with the arsonists .
of course secret services operate in the grey area , because it is only in the grey area that they can pick up the criminal elements operating there .
the statistic he gave is therefore most informative , which is why i am glad he produced it , even if i do not endorse the way he worded his proposal .
it is informative because it proves that middle europe , i.e. , the countries along the former iron curtain , are particularly exposed to cross-frontier bands of criminals and nuclear crime .
this is a most important subject .
it is a european subject , and that is why i am sorry that you have dragged it down to the level of internal politics with your proposals .
it is a threat !
attali spoke of hundreds of cases of nuclear smuggling in a report for the united nations .
the united nations is assuming that russia and many former cis states are not in a position legally or in terms of staffing to combat the spread of this crime .
that is why we must endeavour to do so .
it was not just some flight of the imagination that persuaded the council , the individual member states and the commission to increase and coordinate their efforts and to discuss an increase in funding .
that is why we do support your operative proposals , which are in stark contrast to the opinions you are disseminating here for demagogical reasons .
you know full well that it is necessary to combat international crime on a european basis , and that is the purpose of our amendments and those by mr caccavale .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , let me begin by thanking mr schulz for his report and for the great commitment he has shown in dealing with this issue .
just how much detailed work he has devoted to it is clear from range of documentation and statistics which indicate to us the scale of the problem .
on the other hand , i have also to share in part the reservations expressed by some of those who spoke earlier .
i think that the report has moved a little beyond what is strictly within the area of competence of the house and the committee which has produced the document .
that clearly does not mean that the problems are not linked .
in my view , furthermore , there is no precise list detailing the problem .
we do not in fact know how many people there are posing this great threat that is spreading throughout the world , nor can we identify them .
nor can we hide away behind the fact that this is now a major business .
and to consider that it can be resolved by making proclamations seems to me to be an absolute non-starter .
we have to realize that this is a difficult form of trafficking , that sales are not as easy as in the case of drugs , for example .
it is therefore plain that attitude of the secret services has an important part to play .
the problem cannot just be one of organized crime !
that means that we have to do everything possible to prevent trafficking in nuclear materials and , if it happens , to combat it .
mr president , it goes without saying that we must help the countries of eastern europe to solve their problems in this regard .
the resolution quite rightly calls on the european commission to tell us what the financial implications of that support for eastern europe are and parliament is entitled to be informed of them .
mr president , in connection with measures to counter trafficking i will say just one word : europol . it is of course a scandal that europol is not yet able to function properly .
the subject is far too important .
mr president , the discussion on the illicit traffic in radioactive material in fact raises far more questions than we have answers to at present .
first , we keep just hearing about the sellers .
where there are sellers there are also buyers .
does that mean that the german police are particularly good or that the market there is particularly large ?
or are the police not so efficient in other countries ?
third question : how is it that the german federal government says that it informed euratom on 27 july while euratom says it was informed on 10 august , namely when the aircraft arrived ?
there is something odd here .
the call for the use of europol misses the point .
let me remind you that by law nuclear material comes under the control of euratom .
so euratom safeguards must at last be put in a staffing and financial position that enables it finally to carry out proper controls .
we are rightly upset at the 400 g of plutonium , but we have tonnes of plutonium in england and france .
and there are 103 facilities in which only foreign material , i.e. , nuclear material from foreign countries , is stored .
and another thing : the iaea can only inspect one facility per year in france .
surely that is the real scandal !
that is the real , genuine threat in europe , and i have not even mentioned the cis states yet .
we only have a vague inkling of this threat .
we should have spent far more money on this area in order to enable the euratom safeguards departments to be up to date .
they have to live on crumbs , with which they cannot carry out any controls .
mr schulz 's report , however , is downright disappointing .
instead of a report containing valuable recommendations to the commission , we have a chaotic document in which all manner of irrelevant hobbyhorses are ridden to death .
insistence on nuclear disarmament , the ending of nuclear energy policy , insinuations against the german police .
as a result the committee on civil liberties approved the report by only the slightest of margins , which ought not in principle to be the case in matters dealing with this issue .
significantly , the socialist group only decided to vote in favour of the report once it became apparent that the christian democrats would be abstaining .
because , i ask you , who is there in this house who is not anxious to counter the illicit trading of nuclear substances ?
a broadly based resolution should not be a problem and would certainly enhance the credibility of parliament .
regretfully i have to say that the present resolution in no way meets that need .
i hope that all its shortcomings will be rectified as a result of the amendments , but if not i shall certainly be voting against this report .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mr schulz 's report contains some interesting points .
yes , the traffic in nuclear materials represents a deadly danger ; yes , that traffic has grown alarmingly since the break-up of the soviet union .
but we should not conclude from that that it was the ussr that was preserving europe from the atomic threat .
today , other countries are in the process of providing themselves with atomic weapons , notably iran - a terrorist state - aided by the old communist nomenklatura .
the american government , too , bears some responsibility for this process .
the gulf war has destroyed iraq , the only power in that region capable of counterbalancing the power of the ayatollahs in tehran .
so the scale of the risk is significant , and it was the front national which , during the 1970s , was the first political party in france to caution governments against their all-nuclear policy .
mr schulz , in his report , recommends the nuclear disarmament of france and the united kingdom .
this is a far cry from trafficking in nuclear materials .
he also passes over civil defence , and of course when he talks about borders he means the borders of the europe of maastricht .
moreover , the desire to give extended powers to the commission and to euratom is inspired by the same philosophy .
on the pretext of a threat on a global scale , the member states are to be deprived of their powers in favour of supranational institutions .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the spectre of international organized crime is one of the greatest challenges facing all the member states of the european union .
the problem is a very serious one .
the commission has presented a good communication .
but the discussion will be brought into discredit if it is used for internal policy purposes and distorted into a kind of story time or unworldly energy policy .
and that is why 55 nuclear plants are currently under construction .
but that is not the issue here .
in 1992 parliament proposed international monitoring plans , the classification of certain acts as a serious form of international crime and the training of experts .
in other words a transparent system , together with cooperation between member states on safety technology and of course building up europol .
in particular , plutonium must be rendered harmless by conversion into mox fuel elements .
we can expect 100 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium from disarmament over the next few years .
it has to be reprocessed and made safe .
mr president , i would like to congratulate mr schulz on his report this morning and his presentation and for pointing out to us the problems that we have in this area .
we have the concern in ireland that there are millions of tonnes of plutonium available in the uk and naturally enough it is worrying for us .
furthermore , it is no secret that countries such as iraq and north korea have made attempts to obtain bomb-building capacity .
so for all these reasons it is important to guarantee that we control the supervisory measures over nuclear materials .
it is well known - indeed germany informed the international conference - that 19 cases of thefts involving nuclear materials have been discovered over the last two years .
the response of the commission has been adequate in proposing to beef up the euratom safeguards inspectorate and to develop closer links with the international science and technology centre under the tacis programme .
however , there is a need to improve the legal cooperation between member states of the european union and the republics of the former soviet union to deal with the illicit trafficking of nuclear materials .
this should come under the articles of europol , the european police agency in the hague .
there is also the option of strengthening the controls of the european union borders with eastern europe and finally , we should consider the formulation of various partnership agreements with the eastern european states to deal with this issue .
joint action to help combat this growing problem could also be taken under the european union 's common foreign and security policy .
that is why we are also concerned about the smuggling of nuclear materials and other radioactive substances .
but we must certainly also endeavour to resolve this problem through cooperation with the russian authorities and not through confrontation .
however , my group finds a number of arguments incomprehensible and hard to understand .
firstly , the report does not distinguish clearly between questions of nuclear weapons proliferation and nuclear smuggling .
the differences between the two questions should be made much clearer .
nor do we understand why the report postulates the abolition of nuclear energy while at the same time emphasizing the usefulness of plutonium for peaceful purposes in the european union .
we are dealing here purely with problems in the former ussr , with problems which have indeed taken on dramatic dimensions .
the countries of the former ussr , especially russia , urgently need energy in order to survive , so they cannot abandon nuclear energy .
at the same time , their control systems urgently need modernizing , since they are no longer able to ensure adequate supervision of the nuclear materials and radioactive substances .
the situation is dramatic !
on the question of combating the threat of nuclear smuggling , my group calls for the union to make every effort to link up the various executive authorities and thus finally to establish comprehensive cooperation .
furthermore , we call for closer cooperation with russia on the prevention of nuclear smuggling .
we must raise the necessary funds for this which , we believe , would be well invested .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , from the viewpoint of a nuclear-free member state the plain facts - i emphasize ' facts ' - presented by the rapporteur look twice as serious .
we are dealing here with what is no less than a european and international mega-problem .
given the growth of illicit nuclear trafficking , it still seems legitimate to ask whether the european union should not regard it as an urgent task to endeavour to get out of the nuclear industry .
at any rate , during the negotiations on the accession of new member states , we will have to examine the safety aspect of their nuclear power stations very carefully indeed .
mr president , i will take less than two minutes .
i would like to ask you to give me an opportunity to clarify something .
i can just accept terms such as utter nonsense or similar interpretations , but not the word ' demagogical ' for my statement !
that is why i would like to make a statement of fact that is not demagogical .
twelve member states of our union are not familiar with the problem of nuclear trafficking , three are .
the police authorities of all three countries have confirmed to me as rapporteur that in no case could they establish the involvement of organized crime .
that statement was made by the german , the italian and the belgian police .
that is what i have to say on the subject of ' organized crime ' and ' demagogy ' .
the commission is already implementing , within the limit of its powers , the programme drawn up at the g7 summit in moscow .
against that background you will understand that the commission has considered with great interest the report drawn up by the committee on civil liberties and internal affairs .
the commission appreciates the great effort made by all honourable members to make an in-depth analysis of the various aspects of a complex problem of world-wide importance .
i can tell you that throughout recent years and to the extent of our financial limits - and within the bounds of our powers - the commission has made profound endeavours to move in that direction .
secondly another feature of the european union is that , as you know , apart from the predominantly civil nuclear energy sector , there is another sector of a military nature .
only control of military nuclear material has been expressly excluded according to the euratom treaty and the specific agreements with the iaea .
nevertheless it must be pointed out that according to the euratom treaty all nuclear material outside the military sector is to be automatically included in the ambit of euratom safeguards .
the commission 's present thinking is that the system is working well and that history shows that illicit traffic has not arisen owing to the use of plutonium or highly-enriched uranium in the european union .
it is worth mentioning that whatever may be the final options - vitrification , transmutation , recycling , mixed oxide , - the appropriate safeguards will have to be maintained and even strengthened .
the commission has taken note , mr schulz , of your concern regarding the possible involvement of the secret services in illicit traffic in contraband .
for the moment and taking into account all the information available to the commission , we are convinced that the origin of trafficking lies fundamentally in the serious economic situation of the former soviet union .
so , although it needs a great effort - including sufficient human and financial resources - and although there are many practical difficulties , the commission still believes that prevention through cooperation is called for .
and on this point again , mr schulz , i should like to come up with another consideration of a political nature .
consequently i think it is possible to agree on the objective and what we have to manage is to put the instruments for cooperation into force as soon as possible .
there is one internal consideration regarding the commission .
many of you have made it clear that this is a question which , because of its delicacy and importance , would need more material , human and financial resources .
the debate is closed .
the vote will be held at noon .
votes
this is the wording of my amendment on behalf of my group .
mr president , on behalf of the socialist group , i would ask that we not do proceed to the vote on the oral amendment .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , we have already overrun our time and we still have four motions for resolutions on the schulz report .
this report is most important and in view of the crumbling attendance here i request on behalf of my group that we vote on the schulz report at the next part-session .
i ask you to put that to the vote .
mr president , i find it unfortunate that we never manage to organize our voting time in a way that allows us to make best use of our sittings .
in recent months we have repeatedly seen voting time extending far into the lunch break .
i think we have to organize ourselves better .
so i agree with the socialist group 's suggestion that the schulz report be voted on in two weeks ' time at our next brussels meeting .
mr president , it is very late in any case .
i want to support the request by mrs hoff and mr de vries , for this report really is too important for us to try to get through it now .
i too am in favour of voting on it during the next part-session .
the house will vote on the proposal that the vote on the schulz report be postponed from this afternoon or from tomorrow morning to the brussels part-session .
( parliament decided to postpone the vote )
mr president , the same obviously applies to the titley report as to the schulz report .
however , i would have nothing against our continuing the vote through to the end now .
the house will vote on the proposal that voting continue on the giansily and titley reports .
i want to take what has been expected of us again today , namely to work here for hours and then not to vote , as an opportunity to request that we finally reinstate voting time on thursday evening .
we will not be able to do our parliamentary work here properly without that voting time .
i ask you to put this to the bureau and the conference of presidents .
the nordic passport union which has been in existence for just over forty years has functioned excellently .
the nordic countries have abolished passport requirements for their citizens , but not border controls .
the nordic passport union should not be put at risk for the sake of such a hazardous undertaking as accession to the schengen agreement .
accession to schengen by sweden would threaten the nordic passport union and establish new borders with the baltic states , eastern europe and the rest of the world .
sweden risks becoming part of a european security state which keeps records on and monitors the citizens of the union and prevents others from entering ' fortress europe ' .
in both sweden and norway schengen is being marketed as an enlargement of the nordic passport union .
this is wrong , since the nordic countries have abolished passport requirements but not border controls .
if border controls are abolished ' monitoring measures ' will be needed in the form of common police activities .
this will require an enormous control system , the schengen information system ( sis ) in strasbourg , europol , which is moving in the direction of a federal police force modelled on the american fbi .
there is also a risk that the passport union will be replaced by an obligation to carry a special id card at all times and in all places .
schengen also means stricter asylum , visa and refugee policies , with sweden having to introduce stricter visa requirements for several countries .
the risks of arms and drug smuggling will also increase if border controls are abolished .
we have voted against this resolution because there are all too many question marks involving sweden .
we dissociate ourselves completely from the idea of the schengen agreement being incorporated in the eu treaty .
the nordic passport union has worked incredibly well and should not be put at risk for the sake of the huge gamble which accession to the schengen agreement in many ways represents .
another reason not to proceed with sweden 's accession to the schengen agreement until further notice is the compensatory measures which sweden would have to take when border controls vis-&agrave;-vis the schengen countries were abolished .
it has still not been said what these compensatory measures would be .
it is therefore impossible to vote for this resolution since far too many questions remain unanswered as far as sweden is concerned .
for example , through the schengen agreement sweden would be part of a common territory for the free movement of goods and persons .
for our part , to share such a common area with the netherlands , which takes a totally different view of the cultivation of narcotic crops , is an incredibly risky undertaking .
p&eacute;ry report
mr president , on the p&eacute;ry report , i am most amazed .
we tabled an amendment on how member states get round the multiannual guidance programme by transferring their vessels to third countries and by using flags of convenience .
i am surprised that there were only 47 votes in favour of this amendment , despite the fact that even my own country of ireland complains about it .
this is quite appalling because it represents a failure to recognize that european fleets are far too large and need to be reduced .
member states have to recognize that fact .
but some member states are exploiting this situation and the people representing member states suffering as a result do not even realize this .
the member states who are doing this have to acknowledge that they are not meeting their obligations .
no-one would dispute that there is an urgent need to conserve fishing stocks by reducing fleet capacity .
however what is in dispute is the size of the reduction and the particular manner in which it is to be applied .
ireland , since its accession to the eec , has never been treated fairly with regard to our total allowable catch .
despite the fact that we have 20 % of european coastal waters we have only been allocated 4 % of fishing quotas .
the proposed reduction in the european union fishing fleet should be used to redress this balance and ireland should therefore not be subjected to pro rata cuts .
furthermore if there is to be a major reduction in fishing activity it must be vigorously policed to ensure that there is no illegal fishing .
and given the legitimate concerns of irish fishermen relating to spanish access to the irish box the eu must provide the necessary resources to patrol this and other areas .
i rise in support of the case of the fishermen of southend , leigh and canvey in my constituency , who are further threatened by the commission 's latest announcement .
these fishermen are native to the kent and essex waters , with smaller boats under 17 metres , and have already suffered a cutback of more than half of their catch in the last ten years .
bigger boats from belgium , holland and other uk regions have grabbed their share .
that is why our call today for more involvement by the fishermen themselves and the amendment which i have cosponsored to prohibit ' quota hopping ' of british stocks by other european vessels is absolutely right .
the fishermen of northern ireland have never felt more isolated .
the recent commission announcement of an intended 40 % cut in the fishing fleets of europe was the final blow .
such a proposal would devastate the industry and the communities in which they are situated for they have no alternatives .
this dictatorial approach without consultation with the industry and the fishermen is unacceptable and will be resisted to the bitter end .
the commission says there are fewer fish available to catch .
the fishermen in my area say this is nonsense and the scientists never contact them or ask their advice on the stocks available .
this is an impossible position for the commission and the fishermen .
brussels is too remote and a more reliable system must be found , with more control devolved to the administrations closer to the people .
the problem of quota-hopping and flagging out must be addressed for it causes deep resentment in the industry .
we at present have a common fisheries policy which does not work and is not understood by the fishermen or the industry .
we need and require positive proposals to revive the industry and instill confidence to ensure survival .
with regard to both policy formulation and the implementation of policy , the european union 's approach on fisheries is seriously deficient and ineffective and is doing nothing to assist fisheries development .
the signs are already very worrying , even for a country like greece with its long experience and tradition of fishing and its natural advantages in terms of geography and fishing resources .
arias ca&ntilde;ete report
let us hope that these failings will be corrected .
and then there is the thorny problem of fisheries , which we have been considering today .
the arias ca&ntilde;ete report , as adopted , supports that demand very strongly , and so do we .
this matter of fisheries brings to light an institutional quirk which may help to explain the apparent weakness of the union in the day-to-day handling of its problems .
within the north atlantic fisheries organization , as within many other international bodies in the fisheries sector , the european union has only one vote in total , rather than one vote per member state .
so , within the north-western atlantic fisheries organization , the european union as a whole carries the same weight as cuba .
the commission really must be very anxious to be thought of as the single government of europe if it has come to the point of tolerating this kind of anomaly .
this is something that absolutely must be put right in the future .
this fisheries report contains observations to which special attention must be drawn . i refer in particular to the following recitals :
the eu has nothing to do with these provisions as far as fisheries is concerned . the eu must learn to respect individual states ' sovereignty as regards industries which are important to them ;
v ) which concerns the fact that canada wishes to have zero quotas for cod , which the eu does not regard as being justified pending new scientific data on the subject .
we consider that in the case of fish quotas the precautionary principle must apply so that stocks are not reduced / wiped out .
the eu should respect canada 's opinion concerning zero quotas as an ecological measure based on the precautionary principle .
the danish social democrats are voting in favour of the report on minimum requirements for improving the protection of workers potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres .
workers should be given the best possible protection .
however , a connection is lacking between this proposal for a directive and other similar proposals , for example on chemical agents .
it appears strange for special rules to be laid down when the general basis regarding chemical agents is not yet in place .
the scope of the directive is thus unclear .
we therefore hope to see a move soon from the commission on chemical agents .
stenius-kaukonen report
in that benzene is an extremely hazardous substance which is also extremely common i intend to vote for the most far-reaching requirements which are put forward .
naturally it is my hope that a majority in the eu parliament will also have the nerve to set proper requirements as regards the protection of employees .
even with a limit value of 1 ppm , which is proposed in the report , there are considerable risks of humans contracting leukaemia .
it is therefore reasonable that the limit value should be lowered after 1 january 2001 , as proposed in amendment 20 by the green group .
this limit value is also being proposed in denmark , for example , at the present time .
in this connection it is important that it is made absolutely clear that this provision is binding and that no exceptions will be made .
i naturally support the amendments relating to these requirements .
bar&oacute;n crespo report
is it really necessary to stress once again what an essential necessity the meda aid programme is for the mediterranean countries ?
in december , then , we made the implementation of the programme conditional on two things . one was greater transparency in the allocation and use of the funds provided .
this condition appears to me minimal but essential , and it would be worth using it in some cases with other community subsidies .
what a lot of sterile argument to obscure genuine debate on the merits !
the titley report on aid for reconstruction in the former yugoslavia is full of high-minded sentiments .
it is a pity , though , that this solicitude did not put in an appearance earlier , five years ago , when a number of states in the former yugoslavia expressed the desire to gain independence and sovereignty .
because europe , despite the promises of other donors , is responsible for 1 / 3 of the donations in theory and 2 / 3 in practice .
unless , of course , this europe of yours believes that its international political dimension can only be asserted under the shadow of the clinton administration .
pex report
the pex report is about the way the council treated the european parliament at the last conciliation procedure .
and here the question arises : what interest has the council in ignoring the european parliament 's proposed amendments in this manner ?
after all parliament is not primarily concerned with disputes about areas of competence , as keeps being suggested , but with the matter in hand .
the council 's proposed regulation falls well behind the existing means of supporting the cis states .
furthermore it does not take account of the new facts , namely that the eu now has a long border with russia .
and lastly , what is called the compromise package really only regulates means of improving the way tacis funds can flow back into the european countries and in such a way that all eu countries get their share .
it fully ignores the fact that the sufferers will be the people in the cis countries .
nor does it take note of the fact that small projects in particular will hardly be allowed now .
the disappearance of the entire social dimension and most of the environmental and health aspects will considerably impair the process of transformation in these countries .
by its attitude the council is showing that it does not want these improvements in terms of content either , which is why it is hiding behind the arguments of the compromise package .
that concludes voting time .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
topical and urgent debate
the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
madam president , in this debate today the issue is not whether we agree that the elections in albania were undemocratic .
sadly , everyone acknowledges that there was an orgy of intimidation against the opposition , even those who are endeavouring to paint the situation in a more favourable light .
they are all children of the former regime .
this country is a member of the council of europe .
it aspires to closer links with the european union .
the recent happenings are far from encouraging .
madam president , undemocratic elections have taken place in albania , which is a member of the council of europe .
the lack of a free media , the exclusion of certain opposition parties from the elections together with serious irregularities have made the albanian elections into a farce .
the osce report is very clear on that .
we must do everything we can to steer albania as quickly as possible back on to the road to full democracy .
albania is entitled to this , but so are we . so the elections must be held again from scratch .
political prisoners must be released and the conditions for the holding of new elections must be drastically improved .
to that end the union must pressurize the albanian authorities and suspend cooperation with albania .
the european parliament must send a clear message .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , although the elections took place scarcely a month ago , the public has almost forgotten what happened around these elections .
but the european union institutions must not overlook these incidents .
according to information received from international observers , these elections involved very serious infringements of the principle of free and democratic elections .
even before the elections , president berisha and his government took a number of measures which considerably restricted the chances of the opposition parties .
the opposition had little chance of presenting itself and its programmes to the media .
the infringements of the democratic electoral process even led all the opposition parties to withdraw from the second ballot .
where there is no opposition , there is no democratic state .
as a result of international pressure elections were held again in 17 constituencies without the participation of the opposition parties .
it is clear that this has not saved democracy in albania .
only new general elections that respect the international rules can put the democratic process in albania back on track .
no democratic party in the european union can even consider any further cooperation with a party that shows so little respect for democracy and is only interested in staying in power .
to pretend that nothing has happened is hypocrisy !
that would legitimize cheating and be a threat to democracy .
for the european social democrats it is not the colour of the government party that is important .
all that counts for us is respect for democracy .
full or partial recognition of these elections is equal to the rejection of democratic principles for albania .
so we call on the council and the commission to freeze relations with albania until new elections have been held in this country under international democratic rules .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen .
the electoral fraud that has just occurred in the recent sham elections in albania has been internationally recognised .
in this context , the european parliament must either adopt a clear position on this issue or set serious precedents for the future in similar situations .
the european parliament must adopt a clear position and not adopt any position that is in cahoots with democratic mockeries .
we are therefore dealing with a failure to respect the normal rules of democracy and have therefore to ask ourselves a question : what kind of process of democratization is under way in albania at this point in time ?
we are dealing - perhaps for the first time - with regression of the normal democratic process .
in that context , it is a matter of regret that yesterday , during the debate on the italian presidency , president dini did not discuss the issue of albania .
i believe that it is at any rate necessary at this point to hold new elections that respect democratic rules .
and we can also do this by bearing in mind that we need to replace the 1992 economic cooperation agreement : means of exerting pressure are therefore available to us .
finally , i wish to remind the house of the need to apply , from now on at least , the same methods and the same criteria to all countries in which a process of democratization is under way .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to stick to the facts and not to things someone has read somewhere .
one : initially all the parties took part in the first elections in albania .
at that point , according to its own statements , the opposition saw no unsurmountable problems in participating in the elections .
three : the latter event obviously led to irregularities at some polling stations .
four : the independent electoral committee found that irregularities and acts of violence had taken place in 17 constituencies and repeat elections were held there last sunday .
five : the opposition refused to take part in this second election round .
nobody , my dear mr bertens , was excluded !
six : following the opposition 's call for a boycott the recorded electoral turnout was only 18 % lower .
seven : the high vote for the democratic party was therefore confirmed at the second ballot .
eight : the various observers of the first ballot did not agree in their assessments .
let me remind you , for instance , of the helsinki human rights group .
and since only one report was taken into consideration , the odihr report by the osce , there really are doubts about the election .
the composition of the group of electoral observers is extremely questionable .
i identified no less than 14 of these electoral observers as young socialists , as genuine young socialists and not parliamentarians .
in addition there were two marxists , who were highly regarded guests in albania at the time of hoxha .
these 14 people were originally invited as observers of the communists and only subsequently recruited by the odihr group to observe the elections .
we should also remember that the eu ambassador and the american ambassador in tirana drafted a document yesterday in which they picked the odihr report to pieces .
and they were strictly opposed to these conclusions also being put to use here .
we should take note of that and not only of what fits in with our political calculations .
nine : the albanians voted in accordance with their own views and not the wishes of the left in this house , which greatly pleases me personally .
ten : on the call for the release of political prisoners , let me say that i know of no political prisoners in albania .
i only know of the case of a prominent left-winger who is , however , in prison for financial offences - that is to say , a legal matter that i will not become involved in .
eleven : as mrs hoff said , i expect the albanian government to use its large majority with moderation and to involve the opposition in its activities , even though the latter rejected it .
i hope this opposition will take a constructive approach , for it too represents its fellow-citizens and its country .
twelve : albania had to find its way from the middle ages to modern times , i.e. , from the high-security wing of communism to democracy , in a space of five years .
that is hellishly difficult and there will still be a lot of mistakes for a long time to come .
so let us not be so arrogant and blinkered in our judgment !
we too found it difficult to achieve our democratic standards .
we can be proud of them , but now we should help albania to refine these standards further .
that is what we should do , rather than rejecting it !
in a situation like this , where there is so much doubt , we think that fresh elections have to be held and that we as parliament should make a clear pronouncement on them .
for the albanians ' understanding of democracy it is better , if errors are discovered , that the elections should be held all over again .
my group has clearly endorsed this position , also through the amendments to the joint resolution .
in short , it makes it clear that we stand firmly behind the voter in albania who has been treated with such contempt .
the truth is , indeed , that we find ourselves in a time of democratic decline .
anyone who knows a bit about albania - unfortunately too few people know this country - will remember how things started out there .
i was there shortly after the collapse of the communist regime and saw the dreadful conditions that prevailed there .
of course it is quite clear that you cannot have the kind of democracy we know in switzerland or the uk there yet .
but there is no doubt that great progress has been made .
something really is being done for the people in albania .
the country has a government that really wants to do the right thing , and we have to recognize that .
that irregularities occurred during the elections cannot be denied .
the fact that the elections had to be repeated in 17 constituencies is evidence of that .
but in most constituencies the electoral process was orderly .
i very much regret that the opposition , which for the rest was made up almost entirely of communists , withdrew the electoral observers before the end of the elections .
they simply did not want to find out the truth because they knew full well from polls carried out in the course of the elections that they were facing a major defeat .
so i believe that we should do our utmost to ensure that albania gets what it deserves , namely that it is accepted into the community of european democracies , even if that will still take a while .
the european union has issued a forceful statement concerning those events and has asked for the elections to be held again in those constituencies in which there had been irregularities .
it also stated that the continuation of the electoral process according to international democratic rules constituted an essential factor for the successful future development of relations between albania and the european union .
we also condemn the violent police response to the demonstration on 28 may .
only yesterday an informal meeting of the permanent council of the osce was held in vienna with an albanian delegation to discuss the osce 's own report .
representatives of that organization were invited to tirana to deal with the recommendations and technical aspects of the report .
it - the report - includes recommendations on improving electoral procedures and the holding of elections .
it passed no judgment on the general validity of the elections nor did it state the exact number of constituencies in which it would be appropriate to hold them again .
it is clear that respect for democratic principles and legality will be decisive for the future development of relations with albania .
we must therefore continue to support this internal trend which , i repeat , is in the right direction .
in recent months the commission has been engaged on preparing a negotiating mandate for a new trade and cooperation agreement with albania .
thank you , mr mar&iacute;n !
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 5.30 p.m .
madam president , it is very important that democratic elections should be held in bosnia .
the date has been set and we must stick to it .
bosnia needs a stable and legitimate government , based on democratic elections .
we must thus do all we can to improve the conditions in which those elections are held .
first point : ifor 's mandate must be broadened so that ifor can arrest war criminals and oversee the return of refugees .
free media must be encouraged .
separatist forces must be firmly resisted .
not only must karadzic and mladic be put behind bars , we must also reject the independence of the bosnian croats and strongly condemn the attack on silajdzic .
the announcement that the bosnian serbs are to set up their own tribunal to try their war criminals is yet one more slap in the face for the peace process .
our opposition to these developments must be very resolute and unequivocal .
we must use every available instrument to get the message across .
madam president , i am very pleased with the resolution drawn up by the liberals . in point c there is something i do not altogether like , though .
it says ' whereas holding elections is better than not holding elections , even if conditions leave much to be desired ' .
it is true , but we would be better not saying it .
i really would make that point very strongly to the liberal group .
we have a few other amendments which i think they will be happy with .
i think it is right that this resolution presses for everything to be done to encourage people to vote .
including the refugees who want to vote either from a distance or in person , and who must not be obstructed in this or be penalized in any way for taking part .
and to prevent the elections from in a way setting the seal on ethnic divisions , which is one very real danger we can expect .
madam president , in conclusion i would like to stress that it is unacceptable for the representatives of the socalled republika srpska to refer to bosnia-herzegovina as ' the so-called republic of bosnia-herzegovina ' .
they must recognize it fully , otherwise they will get short shrift from us .
the same goes for the croats who are trying to set up a kind of government in herceg-bosna .
these are things we simply cannot tolerate .
we must vigorously repudiate both phenomena .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the commission fully endorses the european parliament 's resolution on the holding of elections in bosnia-herzegovina .
they represent the crucial factor for the peace process and will form the basis for the constitution of bosniaherzegovina which will give its institutions legitimacy .
in the council for implementing peace in the former yugoslavia held in florence last week , preparation for the elections was one of the main subjects .
although conditions are far from ideal , the feeling was that it was vital to stick to the date of 14 september .
to postpone the elections would aggravate the division of bosnia-herzegovina and would leave the country without appropriate tools to work on its future .
the osce must ensure that the conditions for holding elections are satisfied and fix the date .
it may be assumed that the decision will be taken towards the end of june .
so it will be necessary to make an enormous effort between now and the elections to improve the present difficult situation .
the slowness of the return of refugees and displaced persons , owing to lack of freedom of movement , of course complicates preparations for the elections .
the relationship between the various entities is subject to separatist tendencies and insufficient progress has been made within the croat-muslim federation .
access to the communication media by all political parties is moreover still restricted .
a provisional electoral commission has been set up to supervise the process and the rules on electoral registration , the right to vote - including that of refugees - and access to the communication media .
similarly a series of programmes intended for civic education has been organized .
the member states of the union and the commission fully support the osce 's actions .
the member states - and the commission -have strongly supported the osce 's voluntary fund used for financing electoral preparations .
the community budget 's contribution for civic educational material and for the manufacture of voting booths and ballot boxes comes to ecu 2 million .
by means of a common union programme we shall finance to the amount of ecu 3 million the deployment of observers to monitor appropriate preparations for the elections .
considerable help is also being given to the independent communication media .
in this connection the commission will contribute ecu 2 million to support carl bildt 's proposal to set up an independent television channel .
and naturally the european union as such will also take part in supervising the elections according to rules to be studied with the osce election supervision coordinator .
thank you , mr mar&iacute;n !
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 5.30 p.m .
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
east timor and indonesia
b4-0780 / 96 by mr tomlinson and mr murphy , on behalf of the pse group , on the detention of raghbir singh johal ; victims of chernobyl in belarus
in jakarta the indonesian police , once again , shot a timorese youth .
the gaols of east timor and indonesia continue to detain hundreds of political prisoners .
the indonesian government continues to ignore all of the positions taken by the international community calling for the respect of human rights and the right of the people of east timor to self-determination .
this cannot be tolerated .
we cannot use words alone .
to demonstrate our solidarity with the victims of the struggles and their families we must also call on member states once again to stop selling arms to indonesia and lending it military assistance .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen .
the illegitimate , illegal and bloody occupation of east timor by indonesia is one of the recent decades ' most serious and violent conflicts .
the events of last week in baucau show once more how false have been the promises of peace and how sham is the respect of human rights and free exercise of religion in timor .
the indonesian authorities took part in a terrible provocation of the mostly catholic population 's feelings .
they gratuitously insulted symbols of a religion that they must respect , and killed , maimed and arrested indiscriminately people who legitimately dared to protest .
as we saw in december international hypocrisy actually condoned the terrible crimes that have gone on , you might say , in litis consortio .
it is time to say enough is enough .
it is time to act instead of just talking .
it is time to say that this barbarity is unbearable and shameful for the whole of mankind .
madam president , timor again .
some of our colleagues seem to be a bit tired of this issue .
is there anything new ?
yes , still more aggression and provocations following on from military occupation , and still more demonstrations by a people demanding self-determination .
there is also the fact that we are discussing , umbilically , human rights in indonesia and the occupation and repression that goes on in a still to be decolonised territory .
the same root for two different situations .
representatives of the timorese people are meeting indonesian democrats .
this is a positive signal that we applaud but they are meeting to coordinate different struggles and not to mix up the internal and external struggles .
they have used wily manoeuvres and we shall have nothing to do with them . let us repudiate them .
the question is the right of a people to self-determination , prevented by a military occupation that has led to religious , cultural and physical genocide .
madam president , i am hoping that east timor will be top of ireland 's agenda on foreign policy during the irish presidency .
i believe the best way we can help east timor is to openly criticise our eu partners who are arming the indonesian dictatorship that has subjected the timorese to 20 years of murder , rape , torture and oppression .
we should not be afraid of offending our eu partners by condemning their cooperation with tyranny .
this is one of the problems with this compromise resolution , that it is too weak on this point .
this year at least three european union countries have been involved in arms deals with the regime of general suharto .
britain exported two hawk jets to indonesia in april .
that is the first in a batch of 24 . it is part of a &pound; 2 billion contract for british aerospace .
the pilots for these jets are due to be trained in wales .
sweden has decided to resume arms sales to indonesia .
finland issued a licence in march for the export of 60 armoured troop carriers to jakarta .
in the eyes of the timorese he is the nelson mandela of east timor .
many governments and many human rights organizations have called for his release and for the release of all political prisoners .
the other thing the indonesians have to realise is that we need people to have access to east timor .
i was prevented myself from going there .
parliament should be forcing indonesia to allow people in there to see what is really going on .
madam president , some people are tired of hearing the east timor issue being raised here at the european parliament .
some people think that these things are less important than the roads that have been built in timor by the indonesians .
but they certainly built more gaols .
thankfully there are people who do not swap the values of freedom and identity for concrete buildings and roads .
that alone merits our appreciation .
finally how come the european parliament has agreed on this for the last ten years , since the portuguese arrived ?
why do the united nations not recognise the indonesian occupation ?
all they all blind ?
why are there bullets and not ballots in timor ?
although portugal has been designated administrative power by the un rejects unilateral solutions and is proposing a dialogue with indonesia and a joint solution .
the portuguese prime minister recently made concrete proposals .
but what is serious is that indonesia has not responded to this proposal and carries on torturing .
we shall come here as often as is necessary .
that is the least we can do for the remotest and most ignored of all the suppressed peoples in the world .
madam president , it distresses us that a country like indonesia , which we admire in many respects , is unable to resolve a number of structural problems concerning human rights .
madam president , there are three subjects with which we are constantly concerned here when it is a question of the right of a people to self-determination , subjects for which the colonial period is to blame .
they are the occupation of the western sahara , mururoa and , again and again , east timor .
we have a particular responsibility for that conflict .
we must tell the indonesians that they must respect human rights .
it is a question here of the right to self-determination of the people of east timor .
yet we as parliament and the eu as a whole also bear a responsibility here .
we have discussed the conflicts of dili for years .
now there have once again been demonstrations and incidents .
on 9 and 11 june two people were killed in baucau .
injuries , arrests and further oppression are always the consequence .
we are not dealing here with a religious conflict but with forms of systematic oppression .
in jakarta itself the 25-year-old imanuel suares was executed .
we have the acts of oppression in irian jaya and one of the extreme cases was the arrest of the former member of parliament , sri-bintang pamungkas , because he had spoken in germany .
he was accused of intending to instigate demonstrations against indonesia in germany .
that is absurd , we can do that ourselves .
but we did guarantee him freedom of expression .
that has to be taken into account .
that is why we call for his release .
we have heard , however , that arms are continuing to be supplied from the uk , from sweden and from the federal republic .
the eu cannot permit that .
here it is up to the commission to act .
and it is up to us as parliament finally to set up the delegation we decided to create in 1991 and called for in countless speeches .
here i expect an answer from you , madam president , or from mr h&auml;nsch .
when will this parliamentary delegation be set up ?
how much longer do we have to go on talking about it ?
are the discussions here just window-dressing or will this parliament take action as a parliament ?
only you can give me this answer from the bureau .
i hope this matter will be dealt with at the next bureau meeting .
madam president , i want to say something about nigeria , where the murder of mrs abiola has darkened what was already a murky political situation .
this murder rekindles the memory of the victory of her husband , mr abiola , in the presidential elections just three years ago , and the annulment of the election by the military .
since then , imprisonment and exile have reduced the opposition to living on scraps .
mr abiola , accused of treason , is being held in virtual secrecy and is at risk of the death sentence .
we call for an international commission of inquiry to take up the investigations necessary to ensure that those responsible for mrs abiola 's murder are punished , and we call for sanctions to be invoked against the lagos regime .
on that point , after the execution of the ogoni , the junta - following international pressure - promised a programme of disengagement designed to hand power back to the civilian authorities in october 1998 .
one is the road of indifference or resignation , by following which the european union would bow to the realpolitik dictated by nigeria 's oil wealth , lowering to halfmast the standard of human rights and democratic ideals .
madam president , this house has to protest once again by way of a further resolution condemning murder by the nigerian government .
the murder of mrs abiola is simply the last and most serious incident in a long series of violations of democracy and human rights in nigeria .
the time has come for us to ask ourselves - and i am addressing the commission here - whether we should continue to wait or should try taking substantial measures .
do we want to take that kind of action ? i also believe that it is no longer possible to put off isolating this nigerian regime within the african continent .
madam president , we are shocked at the death of mrs abiola , whose husband is in prison even though he was legitimately elected .
we are shocked at the way the nigerian government is behaving towards us .
the murder of ken saro-wiwa gave rise to vehement international protests .
there were resolutions and discussions .
this hope sprang partly from the fact that we have economic relations with nigeria and that new agreements were concluded .
some of this has been destroyed again as a result of this murder .
this dictatorship is being supported by our trade relations , by us buying up oil instead of imposing an embargo and lastly also by the european union selling arms .
we should not get our hands dirty here .
we should stop at this point and demand that the nigerian government initiate a process of democratization , immediately release mr abiola , move towards new elections and take legal measures to prosecute the murderers of mrs abiola .
only by so doing can it signal a move towards democratization and real respect for human rights .
madam president , the military junta in nigeria rules the country gun in hand and it arrests and murders political opponents and representatives of the civilian population without pity .
the latest prominent victim is mrs abiola , wife of the democratically elected president abiola .
mrs abiola was merely defending the cause of her husband who was arrested because he was victorious in the 1993 presidential elections and the military junta was not prepared to acknowledge his victory .
and in order to silence the democratic opposition , political opponents are terrorized and if necessary assassinated .
nigeria is a great power in africa .
nigeria has the largest population in africa and ties many african countries to it through its oil reserves .
the nigerian military junta thinks that this knowledge and the possession of oil reserves means that it can do as it pleases .
and we have to admit that this arrogant attitude is paying off since world protest is loud but nothing is done .
and only urgent intervention by us to secure a secret vote made it possible ultimately for that critical resolution to be passed by a large majority .
we have been complaining about the nigerian government 's behaviour for months now and i think it is time to take action .
i think the nigerian authorities will only respond to tough measures after everything they have done .
i urge the commission to act along these lines .
mr president , further repressive measures directed at mrs suu kyi and her party have just been adopted by the military junta .
the clear purpose is to muzzle the opposition , by imposing upon it heavy sentences of as much as twenty years ' imprisonment .
yet that is not preventing the burmese opposition from gathering in thousands outside the barred gates of the building where mrs suu kyi lives under house arrest .
her supporters know that by gathering together they are defying the ruling junta .
the deteriorating situation in burma is causing concern to the asean , which had responded to the appeal by the junta by granting credit to it .
that is why its member states are hesitating to introduce sanctions against burma , which might result in the brutal suppression of the activities of mrs suu kyi 's party , the lnd .
it is deplorable that some asian states have now demonstrated their sympathy with the military junta for reasons of commercial opportunism .
we therefore call upon them to ensure that the slorc - the initials of the ruling junta - is politically and economically isolated .
mr president , this third human rights subject also concerns the european union 's relationship with a dictatorial regime and the relations between politics and economic power .
this time we are concerned with burma .
we are concerned with the national league for democracy , with mrs aung san suu kyi , with the opposition movement there .
the latest measures taken in rangoon to suppress the opposition movement , which we support , have shocked us .
the question is , what can we do about it ?
undertakings should give practical support to our demands in their dealings with the political leadership of such countries .
if bmw from germany , heineken from the netherlands , total from france go to burma now , their economic cooperation should be accompanied by political dialogue .
they must not fail to refer to the need for democracy !
mr president , last month we adopted a resolution on the human rights situation in burma which seemed to take sufficient account of the situation there at that time .
regrettably , however , the political situation appears to have taken a turn for the worse with the fresh threats by slorc against not only mrs aung san suu kyi but her followers .
anyone who turns up to hear the weekly address by mrs kyi is threatened with up to twenty years imprisonment .
there are now fears for the personal safety of mrs kyi and of her followers .
we therefore make two proposals in the resolution .
one , to invite the commission to investigate the general human rights situation in burma .
two , to ask our own committee on foreign affairs , security and defence policy to consider sending a european parliament mission to burma for talks with slorc .
we would also ask the commission to report on the use of forced child labour in burma and whether it intends to withdraw the system of generalized preferences .
torture has not been stopped and the prosecution , imprisonment and ill treatment of both turks and kurds who speak out for freedom has continued .
army operations have been stepped up and turkish troops have again penetrated into iraqi kurdistan , despite the declaration of a ceasefire by the pkk on 15 december .
the democratic veneer adopted by the turkish authorities in order to organize the habitat ii world conference in istanbul has quickly peeled off .
demonstrations have been suppressed , and intellectuals are once more being prosecuted before the courts .
leyla zana - who i would remind you was awarded the sakharov prize by this parliament - and three other members of the dep are still being held in prison under intolerable conditions .
the army has intensified its offensive in the kurdish provinces : more than 3000 villages have already vanished from the map for refusing to respond to the cease-fire appeal made by the pkk on 15 december 1995 .
this situation , which has lasted all too long , is intolerable .
the approval of the customs union was a bad solution , because it was perceived by the turkish authorities as an encouragement to persevere .
well , before customs union , i was able to visit leyla zana and the imprisoned members of parliament , and now we can no longer do so .
let us not be indifferent , then , to the hunger strikers in the support of political prisoners .
the adoption of our resolution is a logical continuation of this campaign , which has to be relaunched by the commission and the council , and also by national governments which are demonstrating culpable collusion , or even complicity .
take the case of france , the french government , which is putting on the pressure to develop its trade relations and laughing both at human rights and at the rights of the kurdish people .
no more collusion .
freedom for leyla zana and all political prisoners .
sadly , it appears little or no progress has been made in this direction .
for that reason we are , as a parliament , continuing to withhold our agreement to the adoption of the regulation for the associated financial protocol and i find it hard to see how we could change our attitude .
the reports of ill treatment , to which colleagues have referred , in istanbul 's prisons , are particularly disturbing .
then we have the former mp leyla zana and others who continue to be held in jail , while the famous writer yasar kemal continues to be harassed .
in any case we look to the commission to provide us with the further reports promised to us on the human rights situation in turkey .
mr president , the life of carmelo soria , a spanish national and an official of the united nations removed from his post in chile , came to an end on 14 july 1976 .
he was tortured and murdered by major salinas torres and nco san mart&iacute;n , members of the directorate for national intelligence .
the soria family , like the families of all the victims of that sinister era , demand justice .
nobody is asking for a squaring of accounts , only that those who committed those barbarous deeds should be tried subject to guarantees - which their victims did not have - and should be sentenced .
the transition to democracy in chile is not proving an easy one .
the military authorities are still playing too great a part in the social and political life of that nation .
the constitution grants pinochet the right to appoint senators , a right which he exercises ; that shows the extent to which chilean democracy is controlled by pinochet .
that allows him to continue protecting those who collaborated or committed murder and carried out torture .
it may even encourage justice in chile to act in freedom and without fear .
it is a moral condemnation of the murderers and must be a living memorial to the victims , including carmelo soria .
without justice there is no democracy .
but that has nothing to do with guilty silences which frustrate justice and bring democracy into disrepute .
we are motivated by the basic principle with which i began this speech , that is , that without justice there is no democracy .
and the wish of this european parliament , mr president , is that chile should live in full democracy .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the terrible legacy of the pinochet dictatorship has still not been overcome in chile .
there are still more than one thousand unsolved cases of disappeared people , the torturers and murderers have not been found and sentenced , crimes have not been atoned for !
an unconstitutional amnesty law still covers the period from 1973 to 1978 !
unfortunately i have to add that torture is still taking place in the prisons !
five political prisoners still fear the death sentence and the amnesty international annual report that has just appeared paints a shockingly gloomy picture .
today we are concerned with the case of a spaniard working with cepal who was murdered by the chilean secret service in 1976 .
his file was wrongly closed .
but in fact we are concerned with far more than that , for the murder of carmelo soria is not an isolated case .
it is urgently necessary for the amnesty law pronounced by murderers to be suspended and for the government , military and police apparatus to be purged completely of all those who committed crimes during the military dictatorship .
the families have the right to know who murdered their relatives and that the perpetrators must atone for this .
there must never , never be torture in chile again !
with the forthcoming signature of the eu-chile framework agreement president frei will testify to that .
mr president , i turn to the case of raghbir singh johal who is a journalist , editor of a punjabi newspaper , who has lived peacefully in my constituency for many years and is known to me .
he has been detained since 29 march 1995 , for over 15 months , without charge or without trial .
amnesty international have produced , in february this year , a report entitled ' the wrongful detention of asylum seeker raghbir singh ' .
he is currently awaiting deportation for , and i quote , ' reasons of national security and other reasons of a political nature , namely the fight against international terrorism ' .
this house has often asserted that the rule of law rests on the presumption of innocence in the absence of the proof of guilt .
in this particular case there is a prima-facie case of abuse of internationally recognized human rights .
we therefore call upon the british government either to produce evidence of complicity in international terrorism or to release raghbir singh johal from custody forthwith .
mr president , our europe is a place of boundless idealism .
there are men and women donating their free time , their energies and their financial resources to help the child victims of the chernobyl disaster who were exposed to radiation .
to pursue this aim , there are hundreds of people , thousands of people , in the member states who are giving what they can spare , certainly , but are also giving of themselves to help those children .
and , so far , all this has gone very well .
but what is happening now , mr president ?
this is a scandalous situation .
mr president , the human rights situation is and remains a matter for concern . during the commemorations of tiananmen square 50 dissidents were arrested in order to prevent demonstrations .
there are hundreds of reasons why china deserves to be condemned worldwide for its serious abuses of human rights .
the union must continue making china aware of its bad reputation and we must lobby for worldwide condemnation of china . our standards and our respect for democracy make it imperative that we do so .
we must not be distracted from this by any economic considerations . we must seek broad cooperation with other partners in order to exert as much pressure as possible .
such a policy does exist - it is the old policy of reasons of state and the primacy of commercial interests .
only this parliament seems willing to denounce it .
some will say that this is yet another manifestation of the marginal nature of this parliament .
for my part , i am convinced that the reverse is true .
today , we are preparing to vote on another important text .
mr president , i should like to go back to another of the world 's benighted countries , nigeria .
the measures which the european parliament has called for in earlier resolutions are manifestly not enough to make dictator abacha see reason .
unfortunately too , i see too little serious criticism and measures from africa itself and notably from the organization of african unity .
i mention the oau , mr president , because nigeria is also a responsibility of the african states .
nothing else is going to work .
mr president , first let me say that i am not speaking on behalf of the epp group because this time i am representing a minority of the epp .
mr moorhouse has already spoken for the majority .
i just want to say one thing on behalf of this minority : we are a liberal party which can represent different views .
we systematically regard some nations as the whipping boys of the world and assert all kinds of things about them ; it is quite clear that turkey will figure among them .
yet turkey ought to be our friend , that would be in the european interest .
as europeans it is simply our duty to say some things more clearly , that is in our interest .
mr president , i shall certainly not vote for these senseless resolutions .
thank you , mr von habsburg .
i believe that we have in this chamber 626 people who are free to express whatever view they wish .
i would merely remind you , as i understand it , that you are down to express the view of your group .
a word or two on nigeria now , mr president .
commissioner mar&iacute;n is very familiar with the issue of cooperation with developing countries .
in the case of nigeria we have a weapon : let us throw nigeria out of the lom&eacute; convention , commissioner !
mr president , as regards nigeria , mr caccavale has said it for me : it is clear that the terror campaign waged by this regime continues unabated .
mrs abiola 's murder is proof enough of that .
the announcement of the opening of registration for political parties for the 1998 elections shows that abacha is not prepared to hold democratic elections .
the conditions make it virtually impossible for the opposition parties to register .
once again , the european union must keep banging the drum and in conjunction with other countries must use all means available to put as much pressure as possible on the nigerian military regime .
mr president , on a point of procedure , not really about nigeria .
but it seemed a good time to make this point . if i were sitting in the visitors ' gallery or if i were a journalist i would be a bit confused here .
why can we not take one subject at a time instead , notwithstanding the commissioner 's global horizons , of shunting back and forth between nigeria , china and eastern patagonia ?
we should not do that . it is not a serious way of doing things .
mr president , i should like to speak to say something to mr bertens .
i took up these concerns and reported them to the president , and the parliament staff organized for us an ordered debate in which the various subjects referring to human rights were kept separate .
mr bertens has perhaps not entirely noticed that now each of these subjects is separate on the agenda .
at the end some speeches were intermingled , but during the whole of the debate the speeches were kept separate .
mr president , let us render unto caesar the things which be caesar 's and unto god the things which be god ' s .
mr bertens has already been given a partial reply by mr guti&eacute;rrez .
it will probably not be completely satisfactory , but my invitation to refer the matter to your own group chairmen naturally stands .
mr president , it is unfortunate that we in the european parliament are once again compelled to debate the issue of indonesia .
the indonesian authorities have also imprisoned enormous numbers of political prisoners and we naturally demand that they should be released as quickly as possible .
while the indonesian regime continues with this oppression the member states of the eu should of course stop exporting arms and providing military assistance to indonesia .
to everyone 's surprise arms exports from countries including sweden and finland have been restarted and exports of guns and ammunition have been resumed .
this is taking place under the name of ' follow-up deliveries ' .
guns , however , are not spare parts , nor do they constitute follow-up deliveries .
these activities are therefore totally unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , among the subjects under consideration in this house today is east timor . one can only welcome that fact .
the compromise text contains a few good things , in particular the denunciation of indonesia 's occupation of east timor .
but , alas , i fear that this hour 's debate and the vote that will follow will do little to improve the lot of that small catholic nation .
admittedly , after the ' carnation revolution ' , the portuguese administration collapsed and the territory fell into the hands of two rival factions - the fretilin communists and the muslim factions in the pay of indonesia .
however , the unilateral proclamation of the independence of timor by the communists on 28 november 1975 is no more legitimate than the annexation of these catholic territories by indonesia on 31 may 1976 .
no one consulted either the population of east timor or portugal as the sovereign power .
since then , the 500 , 000 catholic timorese , who have become a minority in a state populated by 160 million muslims , have been suffering the fate familiar to all christian communities in muslim countries - annihilation .
the alternative offered by the communist movement is not much of an improvement .
it is up to us , confronted by these two forms of totalitarianism which are threatening our own countries too , to offer the timorese another alternative - the reestablishment of portuguese sovereignty .
mr president , i met mr raghbir singh johal 's wife several months ago at one of the largest sikh gurdwaras in europe : there were some several thousand people in the sedgely street temple in wolverhampton .
she was absolutely distraught .
she could not talk to me properly because she was crying so much , she was so worried over the detention of her husband .
it cannot be right , in 1996 , that a democratic country imprisons without trial or without charge a man for over 15 months .
i must pay tribute to the british sikh federation and to the national union of journalists who have campaigned tirelessly on behalf of mr singh johal .
that must be our simple , strong , clear message from this house .
mr president , i find it deeply depressing to have to return for the umpteenth time to the subject of turkey , particularly after the approval of the customs union .
there are at least two areas in which that country must sooner or later change it ways .
first , on respect for human rights , where practices and shortcomings in disregard of everything that the international community stands for are still continuing .
then there is the behaviour towards a member state of the european union and towards other mediterranean neighbours of turkey which is seriously inconsistent with the philosophy and principles of the barcelona procedure and international law .
mr president , the policy being pursued by turkey in the region is generating problems and posing a threat to the security and stability of the european union 's south-eastern corner .
turkey must therefore be sent a message from here to put its behaviour to rights .
what did they tell us ?
that we should approve the customs union as a means to curbing the threat from the islamists , namely from the party of mr erbakan .
that by approving it we would be helping the cause of human rights . that there would be big economic benefits for the turkish people .
the commission 's representative in turkey has sent a report to the commission which makes it clear that the human rights situation has worsened .
and as to the economic benefits , just ask the turkish people .
there is something else as well . something which has been worrying me a great deal .
what did she mean by that , mr president ?
what did ' buying the customs union ' involve ?
whom did she buy ?
mr president , the current list of human rights violations in turkey is a long one : illtreatment of detainees , disappearance or death of prisoners .
the facts complained of are virtually always the same , quite a strange situation in a member of the council of europe which has subscribed to the values of liberty and respect for human dignity .
strange or not , as long as turkey refuses to declare out-and-out war on torture , the hope of putting an end to this shameful situation will be a vain one .
mr president , let us at least have the courage to enforce transparency upon turkey when it comes to respect for human rights .
mr president , all those who know , love and value belarus and the people who live there are noting with great concern that human rights violations in that country are becoming a constant theme here .
there are continuous reports about the decline in democracy in that country .
belarus is isolating itself more and more .
wide circles of belarussians , and not just the popular front but also the non-governmental organizations and the liberal democratic and social democratic forces within the belarussian parliament are making efforts to direct this process of transformation towards reforms .
yet the stubborn line taken by the government keeps destroying these efforts .
we must continue to support the democratic forces in that country by adhering consistently to our decisions .
we should constantly remind the belarussian government that in signing the interim agreement it has also signed the democracy clause , which we consider important .
it is incomprehensible why the belarussian government is playing down the decision by this parliament 's committee on foreign affairs and dismissing it as personal animosity .
chilean democracy is indeed recent but we must still acknowledge that the level of democracy in chile is fortunately amongst the most consolidated on the latin-american continent .
since that is the real position it is not right to look away when there , years ago , human rights were trampled under foot and justice has not been done .
mr president , just one comment on the resolution about the behaviour of the authorities in minsk , belarus .
we note in this resolution that medical aid is being provided in minsk by independent ngos , medical aid for children damaged by chernobyl .
they are truly independent ngos .
their aim is to supply medicines to the children in belarus affected by radiation , and these ngos are simply not allowed by the minsk authorities to supply them direct .
they are told they must deliver to the government .
we find that very strange .
we would like to know if the commissioner understands why the authorities are behaving in this way .
what lies behind it ?
we would also ask the commissioner if he is prepared to use our existing ties with belarus to find out what the situation is there in regard to this matter .
mr president , i speak about china and in particular the case of wei jingsheng .
when the delegation of the european parliament was in china last month we were repeatedly asked : why so many resolutions ?
so far 24 have been tabled in parliament on the subject of china and human rights .
the explanation is quite simple .
it is because china ignores basic human rights and ignores its own so-called rule of law that we are able to criticize .
with regard to indonesia i must mention in the first place , mr president , that the commission has protested to the indonesian government on numerous occasions about the human rights situation in that country .
in december 1995 the presidency made representations to the indonesian government with regard to the sentences imposed on journalists .
as you know , the question of human rights was also raised at the last asiaeurope meeting held in bangkok in march 1995 .
the president 's final declaration made it clear that a dialogue should be initiated on the basis of mutual respect , equality and defence of human rights .
similarly the firm commitment to the united nations charter , the universal declaration of human rights and the action programme of the world conference on human rights was reaffirmed at that meeting .
i now turn to the speeches about nigeria .
there can be no doubt that the commission shares with all speakers their regret at the recent murder of mrs abiola .
the circumstances of her death are still , up to a point , mysterious .
the commission recently launched an analysis of the present european union measures against nigeria , applied following the hanging of ken saro-wiwa in november 1995 .
in any case i have told you that the commission is in favour of introducing additional sanctions .
in any case , conscious of the concerns of the european parliament , we intend to continue the dialogue on these questions as soon as there is a new government team in turkey .
both situations must give us concern but in different ways .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m .
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
mr president , time is now getting short for completion of the talks on the comprehensive test ban treaty .
these talks have to completed by the end of next week , or the signing ceremony cannot take place in september during the next session of the un general assembly .
compromises on verification mechanisms and the conditions for the treaty 's entry into force are currently being worked out .
china has finally agreed to things which may mean that it cannot conduct further peaceful nuclear tests .
that at least is something .
the bad news , meantime , is that india has announced today that it will not sign up to the comprehensive test ban treaty .
international pressure must be brought to bear to change india 's mind .
the difficult negotiations are also constantly being undermined by what is going on on the ground .
china 's recent nuclear test and the announcement that it is to carry out another one before september is a slap in the face to the negotiators .
moreover , mr president , the american announcement that subcritical nuclear tests are to be postponed till next year is not exactly encouraging either and detracts from the credibility of this forthcoming ctbt .
america , china and india must all realize that they are jeopardizing everything which has been achieved so far in respect of nuclear arms reduction .
i deeply regret that the people 's republic of china has now carried out a nuclear test after the conclusion of the npt conference .
in the resolution before us today we call on the chinese government to abide by the moratorium adopted at international level .
the chinese must understand that the continuation of nuclear testing is incompatible with implementation of the nuclear test ban treaty .
the chinese government insists that it should be permitted to carry on with peaceful nuclear explosions or pnes .
these scientists are unable to pursue pnes in their own countries due to environmental and cost reasons .
would it be possible to take a split vote on recital e ?
i do not know and i am not qualified to say what the consequences of the recent tests will be on the health of the people living in the lop nor region .
but there are obviously concerns there and it is right that parliament should voice these concerns .
i ask all members to support this resolution .
i am looking for their banners , their streamers , and i see nothing at all .
can i assume that the people 's republic of china 's nuclear tests are safe , or somehow different ?
mr president , let me take a few seconds to tell the honourable member that there are some of us here from the european united left , and i am one of them .
as for the greens , i can see them too , they are here , and i see no banners or streamers .
i think that brings me to the start of my speech , but perhaps it was necessary to open our friend 's eyes and ears so that he can follow what i say .
just after announcing that it would be applying a moratorium on testing from september , china went ahead on 8 june with its 44th underground nuclear test .
it must be admitted that this is not the best way of reaching a successful conclusion to the negotiations currently taking place in geneva on the treaty to prohibit nuclear testing .
on behalf of my group , i join in the international chorus of protest and i condemn the chinese nuclear test just as i recently condemned the series of tests by the french government .
a ban on nuclear tests , including laboratory testing , represents the essential first step down the road to disarmament , to non-proliferation and to the elimination of all nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction .
so i welcome the fact that the compromise motion for a resolution embodies the essence of these proposals .
mr president , allow me to reply in person to the somewhat provocative remarks of our young colleague .
my group did indeed demonstrate with banners and streamers , outside the chinese embassy because it is at china that such action should be aimed .
moreover , if the president of china were to appear in this house we should do the same , and i should be glad if mr dupuis would join us .
mr aelvoet , of course that was not a personal statement : it was in fact a political comment on what the previous speaker had to say .
at any event , the chinese president will not be able to come here .
that , i believe , is out of the question !
mr president , thanks to your wise words , i shall give up my speaking time .
i wish only to say that i note what mr aelvoet said - evidently , it seemed to me also that it was certainly not a personal statement .
as far as i am concerned mr chirac got all he deserved here .
in fact , if i had my way , he would not even have been allowed in parliament .
we have always been outspoken about condemning nuclear tests .
now , just to get back to the comprehensive test ban treaty currently being negotiated in geneva : there must not be any loopholes to allow countries to conduct nuclear tests .
what mrs malone said is very true : recital e is actually misleading .
china has long favoured an exemption from that treaty for so-called peaceful nuclear explosions .
this concept originated in the us in 1957 as a method of investigating the non-military uses of nuclear explosives .
the whole concept is an actual farce because the results of these ' peaceful ' explosions can easily be used to develop weapons of war .
for example , india described its only nuclear test as a ' peaceful nuclear explosion ' , but it still used the results to develop its weapons programme .
the member states which let france go ahead with its nuclear tests all have dirt on their hands , so we cannot take the moral high ground here .
likewise , there is no getting away from the fact that china should cease carrying out nuclear tests immediately .
the signing of a comprehensive nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty including the zero option is a fundamental objective of the common foreign and security policy .
for that purpose the commission associated itself with the european union 's declaration on 22 april last year .
that declaration emphasizes the importance of negotiations to make it possible to sign the treaty in the autumn , precisely at the opening of the fifty-first general assembly of the united nations .
similarly it would be appropriate to try to ensure that the treaty is a universal one and that its application on an international scale may be genuinely monitored .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m .
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
mr president , first i should like to propose an oral amendment to the joint motion for a resolution .
it is to add at the end of paragraph 5 a request to the commission to retain its office in burundi .
in the past week - since the tabling of this motion for a resolution on the death in burundi of humanitarian aid staff - a further 70 civilians , this time hutus , have been murdered .
all deaths have the same value , but the murder of three members of the international committee of the red cross marks a qualitative change in the scale of the conflict .
for the first time there has been an attack on the international presence which plays a fundamental r&ocirc;le in the attempt to contain of the conflict by means of humanitarian aid .
at every significant stage in this war the european parliament has approved a resolution with specific proposals .
now that we are about to vote on one more we have to wonder about the point of this type of action .
politics take on a purpose only if they extend to practice and do not keep repeating the same thing , each time with less impact .
however , neither the commission nor the council nor the member states of the european union individually have provided the resources for these measures to be applied or consequently for peace to be a reality in burundi .
once again we condemn the situation but we also wish to condemn the failure to put these measures into practice .
mr president , i too am alarmed at the constant deterioration in the situation in burundi .
and yet there is no shortage of international diplomatic initiatives working to restore peace .
but the impression one gets is that there are arguments for and against each of them , to the point where none of them make any progress .
the intransigence shown by some of them is dangerous , because it threatens to plunge the country in despair , opening the door for the settling of scores .
that is what the extremists have long wanted , and with each day that passes they become more difficult to control .
so , mr president , when are we going to see an arms embargo ?
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , if there is one subject on which i think everything possible has been said and said so many times without any adequate action being taken , it is the situation in burundi .
last friday i entertained a delegation of parliamentarians from burundi .
i was given a whole list of killings in a particular diocese , the diocese of muinga , from which it is clear that the army itself is blamed for half of all the cases .
there are two things which need to be said .
secondly , it must be pointed out that all the international organizations are currently in the process of pulling out , including the representatives of the european commission .
as regards the latter , i would earnestly recommend that the people there are given the protection which they themselves have requested .
mr president , honourable members have rightly condemned the climate of violence again present in burundi .
i am then asking how and whether the european union is seeking to prevent those organizations from abandoning burundi .
here too , i believe that the commission can take further steps to secure improved protection .
let me follow this up with a few other questions .
what has become of our calls for the dissolution of the armed militia ?
what has become of our call for support for the oau so that it can join in implementing this global action plan ?
what has become of our call for the legal prosecution of criminal offenders and for aid for the restoration of the certainty of justice ?
what has become of the proposal to send out human rights experts under the umbrella of the unhcr ?
and what has become , for instance , of our call for some pressure to be put on the security council to keep the conflicting parties apart ?
we already called for that last month !
what has become of parliament 's call for the council and the member states to draw up emergency plans in case the violence should escalate and to create safety zones to protect the civilian population ?
we called for that too in may this year !
what became of the document on preventive diplomacy of december last year that was accepted by the council ?
what became of the measures we called for in order to protect the humanitarian workers and what is to become of our appeals today ?
mr president , once again today we see that the world is letting slip a chance of using active , preventive diplomacy to stop a conflict from escalating .
the bloodbath in burundi which involved members of the red cross and other ngos is bound to have repercussions .
how long does the international community think that the ngos will go on providing humanitarian aid if they remain targets for uncontrolled young people and gangs ?
when are we at last going to decide to accept our responsibilities ?
we seem to get nowhere when we ask for the carcassonne action plan to be carried out .
it does not seem as if an international military force for burundi is going to get off the ground .
srebrenica must not mean that we are never again willing to take part in peace-keeping operations under un auspices .
we must accept our responsibility , even if it is just in training and helping to set up an african military presence .
and further work is needed on the political front too .
nyerere 's initiative , as has already been said , is very welcome , and so is the european special envoy .
mr president , the tribal warfare between hutus and tutsis is escalating again , this time in burundi .
extremists on both sides have gained control there .
the tutsi army is losing its hold on the countryside and various hutu guerilla movements are increasingly carrying out attacks in a number of regions .
and the civil war is increasingly becoming regional in character .
it is also worth pointing to the extremely dubious role being played by president mobutu of za&iuml;re .
he says he wants the rwandan and burundian refugees to return to their homeland , but in reality he is supporting the hutu rebels .
there are even indications that the za&iuml;rean army is helping the hutus with ethnic cleansing .
the media too play an important part in the ethnic conflict .
one even hears talk of a hutu press and a tutsi press .
last time the conflict in the great lakes region was discussed it was still possible to argue in favour of a regional conference .
that time is now past .
ending the bloodshed must now be the first priority .
international intervention in burundi is thus a matter of urgency .
the question is whether intervention in burundi alone might not simply move the conflict to the neighbouring countries of rwanda and za&iuml;re .
following its action in somalia the usa has intimated that it is prepared to send equipment but not troops .
it is also doubtful whether france will take the lead in view of that country 's close involvement with the parties in the region .
mr president , the commission profoundly regrets the murder of three red cross delegates and the threats recently made against their colleagues in burundi .
this is tragic evidence of a security situation which is rapidly deteriorating .
the commission has therefore decided , in close consultation with the member states , to evacuate from burundi families and staff not regarded as essential .
however the commission will continue to be represented on the spot and to support the efforts to re-establish peace and stability in the region and in burundi in particular .
missions from the troika have visited burundi , various diplomatic representations have been made and both the union and the european parliament have put forward various resolutions .
the european union is trying to play an active part in these efforts as is very clearly shown by the appointment of mr aldo ajello as a special envoy of the european union in the region .
mr ajello is already recognized as a valuable partner in the quest for peace .
his mandate is to support the actions which are in progress - in particular those of ex-president nyerere - and to press for a regional conference under the auspices of the organization of african unity and the united nations .
we place great hopes in the laudable efforts of ex-president to unite , or reunite , the parties to the conflict round the negotiating table in tanzania .
since the beginning of the crisis in the great lakes region the community budget has made available more than us $ 700 million in humanitarian aid and rehabilitation work .
considerable sums are still available and the commission would be prepared to release them as soon as the political , security and human rights situation allows .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m .
votes
mr president , in amendment no 4 by mr pex there is a problem in the english translation .
could you ask the author of the amendment if he could explain the phrase ' decisions taken on improper grounds ' .
it does not make sense in english .
mr president , i am against this amendment .
it is quite improper in the english language and it is quite contrary to the treaty .
we cannot accept this amendment in its present form .
mr pex knows that and has admitted so to me .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , firstly i would like to congratulate the ombudsman on a successful first year of activity .
one of the european ombudsman 's most important tasks is to play a role in developing a union citizenship , which presently is only a small germ of an idea compared to what it could become .
it is very pleasing that the ombudsman , mr s&ouml;derman , has chosen to take a stand on a matter of such importance to all citizens as openness within the european union .
openness is one of democracy 's cornerstones , and mr s&ouml;derman has sent an inquiry to union bodies regarding the way in which documents are made available to citizens .
let us hope that this inquiry speeds up the development of openness and transparency within the european union .
this way also the ombudsman 's authority would increase and develop its full potential .
it is evident from the above that the european ombudsman plays an essential role in developing the european union into an authentic citizens ' community .
the european ombudsman has its good and bad points as an institution .
the same applies to mr s&ouml;derman 's report .
on the positive side , any system of complaints can help to promote the hard-pressed concept of legal safety .
unfortunately , mr s&ouml;derman has already accepted this function in his opening statement on taking up his post in september 1995 .
it grated on the ear to hear him say that the idea behind the european ombudsman was to promote the concept of european citizenship .
there is no shortage of control mechanisms in the eu ; they have a tendency to develop into self-sustaining bureaucratic instruments .
if the ombudsman were to be an effective guardian of legal safety in the same way as the national ombudsmen , it would require a huge bureaucracy .
by way of comparison , the danish ombudsman has a staff of 25 lawyers .
i wish to record my support for the new ombudsman as this new role is another step in the direction of making the european union more accessible to ordinary people .
as an elected representative i feel it is vital that my constituents have someone to turn to with their complaints at the highest level .
i recognize that the ombudsman has already become a champion of ordinary people 's interests .
however , as the role of the ombudsman is so new , we in parliament must make sure that both the council and the commission cooperate fully with his office .
any information required to answer people 's enquiries must be forthcoming from the council and the commission .
having established this important new role to give our citizens more knowledge of eu decisions we , as their representatives , must make sure they are not disappointed .
there must be no secrecy where my constituents ' grievances are concerned .
that concludes the vote .
money laundering
mr president , this is a report the commission submitted with a view to implementing the 1991 money-laundering directive .
we are giving our position as parliament .
there can be no doubt at all that combating money laundering is one of the crucial crime-prevention tasks of our time .
there is a very close link between money laundering and organized crime which - as we all know - is constantly growing in europe too and threatens to take on huge dimensions .
this 1991 directive does in fact set a relatively low standard compared to most of the legislation in the individual member states .
let me put that more simply : basically this directive mainly covered drug-related offences , which is one aspect of organized crime .
the uk is one of the countries that has gone furthest here .
the other extreme , if i may cite an example , is luxembourg which by comparison has a very liberal money-laundering legislation which basically only comes up to the minimum standard laid down in the directive .
parliament 's committee on civil liberties and internal affairs and committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights organized a hearing on this report in december last year , which the commission has submitted to us .
it appeared from the hearings - for we also heard a representative of the federal criminal police office in wiesbaden - that the same difficulties arise with regard to the coverage of different occupational groups .
here the experts called for closer harmonization - in plain english for the money-laundering directive to be tightened up - in order to facilitate cross-frontier measures to combat crime in europe .
a further aspect that became clear from the hearing was that a number of new forms of financial services now exist .
one example is direct banking , which in the experts view is evidently not properly covered in most member states and is of course not covered by this directive either .
both committees , legal and internal affairs , considered that it would be most useful to adjust the directive to the new situation in this area too and of course then to adapt national legislation accordingly .
those are the main requirements laid down in the report before you and which we ask the house to endorse .
as rapporteur i was against going beyond organized crime because i believe otherwise it would be very difficult to differentiate .
the second problem concerns the following : with this money-laundering legislation we are intervening very deeply in the relationship of mutual trust between banks or financial institutions and clients .
for it to intervene in their relationship of mutual trust does indeed mean that the state must have a very strong interest in taking such action .
that is the subject of my report .
i ask the house to approve it .
mr president , today money laundering is probably the most sophisticated and complex financial transaction .
gone are the days when some petty criminal walked into a bank with a suitcase full of notes .
the advances in electronic banking have removed the personal contact , and criminal-controlled financial outlets provide a legitimate base for successful money laundering .
this is a global problem which has no regard for any international boundaries .
the european union must play a prominent role in international efforts to deal with this global crime issue .
the united states of america is arguably at the forefront of the campaign tackling the problem of money laundering .
but its efforts can only be successful if it is aided and assisted by other countries .
it is , therefore , to our eternal shame that the european union has not fully established europol or provided the necessary resources for it .
the blocking actions by a certain member state , it could be argued , are every bit as criminal as the people involved in money laundering .
there will also have to be a harmonization to a higher standard of the laws on money laundering throughout the member states of the european union so as not to allow a weak link within the union .
we must also look beyond our borders where the european union has influence , especially to those eastern and central european countries .
with the collapse of communism , overt criminal activity has increased .
financial institutions within these countries are now being regularly used as a link in the chain to legitimize dirty money .
money laundering is not solely connected with drug trafficking but also takes in arms dealing , prostitution , art fraud and many other criminal activities .
by tackling the ill-gotten gains we will start to tackle the problem of crime .
we must not allow europe to become the centre where crime pays .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the commission has presented a first report on the implementation of the money-laundering directive which is very useful and informative .
it offers us an opportunity to concern ourselves in detail with the phenomenon of money laundering and to identify the weak points in the measures for combating this offence .
the weak points derive from the fact that the directive does not go far enough but also from the fact that organized crime is becoming increasingly cunning and using both new techniques and new means of investment .
any measures that prevent the proceeds of crime from being smuggled into the legal economic process are therefore very valuable and well targeted .
the motion for a resolution contains some sensible requests to the commission to extend the scope of the directive .
in particular , national legal provisions on money laundering should expand the list of activities that constitute criminal offences .
it is incomprehensible why only drugs trafficking should be included and not other forms of organized or professional crime .
as has been pointed out , organized crime includes a whole range of crimes , from traffic in human beings to arms traffic , blackmail for protection money , gambling and many other areas .
so it would appear important to include all these areas of crime and all the proceeds from them .
i also think other occupational groups must be included in the scope of the directive .
criminal organizations are inventive and their interest in the banking sector heightens the risk .
i just want to say a few words on the banking sector .
mr lehne mentions in the explanatory statement to his report that savings accounts in austria could be used for money-laundering purposes .
to that i can only say that there are no savings accounts in austria , only savings books .
money can be paid into savings books and money can be withdrawn from them .
but money cannot be transferred .
i believe it is important to establish that .
and i want to make it quite clear that accounts are not anonymous , neither current accounts nor any others , and that anonymity has also been abolished for securities accounts .
austria lays great value on the fact that it is not a distributing centre for money laundering .
to return to the content of the resolution .
it can indeed be observed that mafia organizations and business people are appearing more and more often in the fields of real estate , gambling , jewellery and art with dubious funds .
so it is worth considering whether occupational groups such as jewellers , casino owners , lawyers and notaries should not be involved more closely in helping to combat organized crime .
technical developments in financial transactions are also facing us with new problems .
it is very important to improve cooperation with the authorities responsible for combating organized crime and to keep a constant watch on developments .
criminal organizations adjust very quickly to new measures and methods .
it is important to remain on the ball and react very promptly to changes .
the opinion of the committee on civil liberties and internal affairs takes the same line as the motion for a resolution submitted by the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights .
it too calls for the directive to be amended and to include in its scope a wider range of criminal activities .
combating internationally operating criminal organizations is a great challenge for the european union and its member states .
the people of europe expect us to combat crime successfully .
combating money laundering is certainly an important means of combating international crime .
mr president , you will understand that in my constituency , in essex in the uk , the menace of drugs misuse is bitterly understood .
in the last year in our community we have suffered the tragic death of teenager leah betts , after taking ecstasy pills in a basildon nightclub .
i am sad to say that we understand only too well that the scourge of drug addiction is big business too .
that businessman 's used car business is under investigation as a possible front for drug trafficking and therefore as an easy way to launder the profits of this destructive trade .
after the scandals of nick leeson and barings and in the last week of mr hamanaka and the sumitomo corporation we know that massive fraud and deception is happening today within these multinational financial institutions .
end the dirty dollars and the hot money and we will really put a stop to the senseless and needless deaths .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , money does not stink , as the saying goes ; i would add , unless it is laundered .
that takes me right into mr lehne 's report , which i consider particularly thorough .
money laundering is , as we know , only the final link in a long chain of criminal activities , many of which are coordinated by organized crime .
as we all know , these are cross-frontier phenomena which , like combating fraud in general , require intensive cooperation between the member states of the european union in the field of both domestic policy and judicial policy .
consequently we need comprehensive legislative action to improve the coordination between the national judicial and police authorities .
in this context particular emphasis is laid on the need for appropriate procedural provisions in the member states .
only then will it be possible to detect and prosecute criminal money launderers successfully , for instance by making it easier to monitor telecommunications traffic or temporarily confiscating assets .
the rapporteur rightly points out that the criminals are entirely at home with computers and the most recent techniques .
that this requires highly developed control systems and techniques but also of course specially trained personnel is self-evident .
the call to extend the measures to combat money laundering not just to money from drugs trafficking but to all the proceeds of organized crime is also important .
it is particularly necessary at this time for us in the european parliament to give a signal to the people and to make them more confident that europe is combating crime consistently and successfully .
in that sense the lehne report is a major step forward .
mr president , i wish to begin by thanking mr lehne for the excellent work he has done .
i do not , however , believe that it will be possible to resolve the problem on the basis of controls or policing activities in regard to banks , for example .
otherwise how can we ascertain whether or not they are legitimate ?
mr president , commissioner , the rapporteur had to do more than just square the circle or hit a nail on the head .
because of the 1991 directive he was forced to take a legislative approach to a subject that is after all basically financial and economic .
he had to deal with a range of criminal activities for which there is no eu criminal law .
he had to set up a police force for which there is neither a legal basis nor democratic or judicial control .
the rapporteur is certainly not responsible for the mistaken philosophy on which the entire money-laundering legislation is based .
that creating ' clean banks ' will be a strong weapon for combating money laundering is in my view the opposite of likely in more than one respect .
nowhere is any mention made of numerical data on either the conventional or new laundering channels , although the total extent of the laundering of capital can be evaluated at ecu 500 thousand million .
more seriously , the report gives a clean sheet to the twelve member states that signed the directive .
yet the reality is very different .
how can we explain the fact that the dutch government has ratified a unique form of tax convention with the dutch antilles dependencies ?
i shall not go into any detail about the fiscal and banking legislation in the grand duchy of luxembourg .
and i can already picture austria 's formal ratification of directive 91 / 308 .
how are we to explain the fact that a state that is home to 8 million souls has managed to amass within its territory more than 20 million anonymous savings books ?
do we have to wait for one of our heads of state to be caught in some dark dealings with money laundering , perhaps associated with arms dealing or drug trafficking ?
do we need a european version of mr samper to force our leaders to see reason ?
let us start by going to the root of the problem . let us start by regulating and legalizing all drugs , now .
until that happens , my group will abstain .
mr president , the commission 's first report on the implementation of the 1993 money laundering directive has pointed to vast differences in the way the legislation is applied by the member states .
as a result it is still possible for dirty money to move with ease throughout europe .
the irish government has declared the fight against drugs a priority of its presidency .
i share mr howitt 's concern that the existing laws do not crack down on the proceeds of crime .
indeed a major international crime conference in dublin this week highlighted the very serious difficulties drug squad officers from european countries have in dealing with the europol drugs unit in the hague .
there were , for example , long delays in obtaining vital information from some countries .
the current directive on money laundering is clearly ineffective given the scale of this drug problem in the cities mentioned and in other areas and also the ease with which the proceeds appear to be laundered into legitimate businesses .
we clearly need a far more flexible legal framework to keep abreast of technological advances in banking systems .
some of these have been outlined by mr miller .
i want to see a situation where criminals , whether they are drug dealers , ira , bank robbers or white-collar fraudsters find it impossible to launder their ill-gotten gains anywhere in europe .
i am also calling for much closer cooperation between the police , the courts , the revenue authorities and financial institutions .
i have spoken to some accountants who work in this area .
what they recommend is that civil proceedings should be taken in tandem with criminal proceedings so that the ill-gotten gains be confiscated on conviction .
we should not forget that al capone was eventually imprisoned for tax evasion .
finally , the directive should also be extended to cover the proceeds of fraud against the eu budget .
in ireland we have the scandal relating to the beef export refunds and the continuing massive transit fraud in , for example , cigarette smuggling .
there are huge sums of money going astray which we could use very effectively in the european union .
mr president , i would like to thank mr lehne for an excellent report .
money laundering is a growing problem in all member states .
the authorities should prevent criminal money from penetrating the financial system .
this is essential , since criminal money puts at risk the reliability and stability of the entire financial system .
money laundering can be done in various ways , which is why the reporting obligation should be extended .
dealers in securities and money exchange bureaux will in all likelihood be obliged to report this year .
a number of international organisations are involved in resolving the problems of money laundering .
there is clearly a need to co-ordinate measures at european level , in order to avoid a duplication of effort .
organized crime is active there too .
that is why we need comprehensive rules .
it is also necessary , however , to include and criminalize fraud involving eu budget funds in all the eu states .
to date that is only the case in some countries and it is quite incomprehensible why loopholes are being created here , which make it more difficult if not impossible to combat money laundering .
there are quite other reasons for that .
as mrs hlavac rightly pointed out , it is simply the case that many people open small savings books for their children , grandchildren and for the whole family .
that area is not suitable for money laundering .
organized crime uses dummy firms , fictitious transfers and cover-ups on a large scale .
that is why the community has to take a coordinated approach and needs a uniform information system , which also has to be extended to the visegrad states if they are to be included in our system .
we are all aware of the damage being done to our society by the drugs traffic and other forms of organized crime .
if we can prevent criminals from laundering , using and investing their dirty money that will be an effective means of combating crime .
as we all know , dirty money corrupts everything , including the financial system .
and that was also the point of departure for the community 's activities in this area , namely the prevention of misuse of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering .
pursuant to the 1991 directive , the commission must report to parliament and the council on its application .
we have done so , our report is the subject of the report before you this evening .
the commission is convinced that the directive entirely fulfils its task and that in general it was transposed well in the member states .
but that does not yet mean that we have effective means of also combating the causes of organized crime .
as our report says , money laundering is now a criminal offence in all member states .
at first , in 1991 , that was not the case , as we know .
we broke through the protection offered by banking confidentiality .
all financial institutions now have to actively notify the authorities of any suspicion and may no longer just wait until they are asked .
yet it will never be possible to regard the battle against money laundering as won .
as soon as we close up one loophole in the system , the money launderers look for new points of attack and , as has been made very clear here , use the most recent techniques for doing so .
but we can make this increasingly difficult and expensive for them and thereby thwart their tactics and strategy to some extent at least .
both reports realise that this battle is a long-term one .
i only want to discuss a few of the most important matters raised in the motion for a resolution , since there is no time to go into all 20 paragraphs individually .
many of these points are addressed not to the commission but to the member states , as the rapporteur just said in his oral statement .
let me just point out that extending the scope and improved cooperation form part of both the vienna and the strasbourg conventions .
the commission will examine every single point you raised in depth and will certainly discuss them with the member states .
that is why the commission has deferred the scheduled meeting of the contact committee until the autumn , so that this report by parliament can be discussed adequately and thoroughly there .
what are the main themes ?
firstly , the report requests more information from the commission on reported cases and convictions , on new types of money-laundering and their economic effects .
as you know , some of this information is extremely difficult to obtain .
the council has already requested a second report on certain aspects of the directive and we will be drawing up another report both for parliament and for the council .
the present report also calls for a revision of the directive .
this relates mainly to the field of new financial techniques , but also to the other occupations and activities concerned and to their proper surveillance .
to be frank , the commission is rather hesitant to draw up a new directive at this point .
the 1991 directive determines the objective and leaves the member states a certain amount of room for play in implementing it .
it is not a technical measure and nor does it examine the individual financial products or techniques , but it can also be applied to areas that are not specifically mentioned in it .
nor is the commission entirely sure that it has a firm legal basis for further-reaching measures to deal with the fact that the main emphasis of measures to combat money laundering is shifting away from the formal financial sector .
as was also made clear in the report , it is generally agreed that what is needed most at present is closer cooperation between the member states ' authorities responsible for combating money laundering .
several speakers here have also pointed that out .
cooperation between the police and the judiciary is an area in which the commission does not at present have any right of initiative .
so we have to confine ourselves to calling for closer cooperation in this area and i hope we can jointly urge more movement on the third pillar at the intergovernmental conference .
the commission is currently working on a number of areas together with the contact committee .
they include the misuse of bureaux de change and the problem of non-personal transactions such as telephone or computer banking .
this committee is doing very good work and the commission is confident that further progress can be made in the framework of the existing directive .
only if this fails will the commission consider a further directive and even then only if it has found a solid legal base for it .
in any case the commission will keep parliament informed of both the progress made and the problems encountered .
let me briefly discuss the requested extension of these measures to the eastern european states .
finally , let me again thank parliament for its comprehensive and constructive report .
the commission will continue the dialogue with you and i hope that together we will manage to achieve better results .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 9 a.m. tomorrow .
linguistic diversity in the information society
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this proposal from the commission comes in the framework of the growth of the information society .
the commission is proposing the adoption , that is to say , of a multiannual programme to promote the linguistic diversity of the community in the information society .
this proposal brings two benefits , the second of which flows from the first .
the use of this single language threatens to lead to a standardization of thought and to deprive large numbers of people in the union of access to information , progress and knowledge .
the second benefit is economic and springs from the fact that undertakings which have previously confined themselves to local markets will in future be helped by multi-lingual products to find international outlets .
the question we have to ask ourselves is whether the promotion of linguistic diversity in the union is an objective end it itself or simply a means to the promotion of the information society at the international level .
the committee on culture has come to a clear conclusion , namely that the programme as such is the main objective and that appropriate means are contained within it for the realization of that objective .
this means that the cultural dimension of this programme has priority over the industrial effects and that therefore a change is necessary in the legal basis .
the programme ends in 1998 and has a budget of ecu 15m .
allow me to turn now to some of the committee on culture 's most important amendments .
amendments nos 1 , 2 and 7 make the case for placing the commission proposal in the cultural sphere , with article 128 as the legal basis .
in a related way , amendments nos 8 , 9 and 10 emphasize the social aspect of the information society , the need to ensure democratic access in order to protect certain population categories against exclusion .
amendment no 11 underscores the threat of ' dialectification ' to languages left on the margins of the information society .
amendments nos 23 and 39 deal with the economic aspect .
most of the enterprises with an interest in this programme are small and medium-sized , and it is important that we protect and assist them .
amendment no 25 proposes the use of the structural funds by the member states to help protect our linguistic heritage .
many of the amendments call for special attention to be paid to the lesser-used languages and for examination of the possibility of seeking synergies with other social programmes such as the ariane programme .
lastly , taking account of the great importance of this programme , it is proposed that the financing be raised from ecu 15m to ecu 20m .
there is a concern to promote the many languages which exist throughout the european union .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , let me begin by warmly congratulating mrs mouskouri on her polished and excellent report on the commission proposal on promoting the linguistic diversity of the information society .
i emphatically support her in her attempt to free this three-year programme from the confines of the purely economic vision of the commission .
for linguistic diversity is not just an economic resource that may even represent a barrier .
the terms used by the commission , such as language industries , language as a product and so on , totally disregard the fact that linguistic diversity is a cultural asset and an important mark of identity .
this cultural heritage must be preserved .
that is why preference should be given to article 128 as the legal base .
it concerns culture and gives precedence to non-commercial , cultural exchanges .
it ensures co-decision by parliament , instead of mere consultation under article 130 , as the commission proposed .
since i am delivering the opinion of the committee on budgets , let me point to a few financial aspects .
that also includes administrative costs .
for the rest , the financial statement does not take account of potential revenue from the participation of non-member third parties .
nor is the number of officials already working in this field clarified ; two additional posts are being requested and two national experts .
we should take every care to avoid duplication of work and costs .
that is why we propose a link-up with other programmes , e.g. info 2000 or telematics .
it is doubtful whether the advisory committee will have the kind of overall view that will enable it to promote not just mega-projects but also micro-projects .
these two questions of the advisory committee and the establishment plan posts both need to be examined during the annual budget procedure .
i warmly thank the rapporteur again for accepting the amendments from the committee on budgets .
any effective action must start out with a sound knowledge of the facts of the problem .
in that connection , the commission document is disappointing .
indeed , apart from a very approximate estimate of the financial dimension - unsupported and lacking in detail and some reference to jobs - it contains not the slightest analysis of the market in question .
this seems to us to represent a highly detrimental omission .
it would be desirable for the commission to complete its proposal by adding a searching analysis of the world and european markets and of the strengths and weaknesses of european undertakings .
this would create the opportunity to make soundly-based choices and to target efforts .
it is clear that this programme is far from equal to the situation it describes .
given the advantages of union industries , the activities of european undertakings in this market deserve to be supported .
this programme in its present form is incapable of providing the necessary assistance and it can , at best , prepare the ground .
the development of the global and multimedia means of communication can jeopardize the cultural and linguistic diversity of the union .
in this connection , the arrival of new translation and interpretation techniques can help the so-called minority languages to flourish .
on the other hand , technological development that will lead to production of new translation and interpretation tools could enable the european union to exploit economically its natural knowhow in multilingualism at world level .
a market for these new applications of language technology is a highly promising one , in particular in terms of job creation and exports .
in that connection the union must conduct an interventionist policy of accompaniment and support for the efforts of european undertakings that have committed themselves to this market .
i share her view that we must dismiss the quick fix of english only : we must take concrete action to promote cultural and linguistic diversity in the information age .
the right of mother tongue access to information technology must go hand in hand with the promotion of language learning .
in this regard , the non-official languages of the union which have a status recognized at regional level are used as instruments of communication , both for the transmission of technical information and in teaching and cultural activities .
the diversity of the languages used in the european union constitute a wealth that must be preserved and dynamically developed , both from a cultural point of view and to secure economic spin-offs for the language industries .
action taken in this programme should help to create a favourable environment for strengthening the language industries .
i thank the rapporteur very sincerely for her efforts .
finally , we must create an environment favourable to the expansion of the language industries and promote the development of multilingual services .
mr president , i congratulate mrs mouskouri on this report on the promotion of the linguistic diversity of the community in the information society .
the development of globally interlinked information and communication services could have a major impact on the languages we use .
people who are not in a position to communicate properly in the usual languages could be prevented from taking full part in our increasingly information-oriented society .
since information affects all levels of society , equality of opportunity for all is of major importance in order to ensure full participation by all .
if we allow the information revolution to advance unchecked this could lead to a two-tier society .
many of the minority languages find themselves in difficulties under the influence of changing communication patterns .
if the new technologies are put to full use that could even speed up the process and risk destroying the linguistic and cultural diversity of the european community .
that is to say , we are concerned today not with cultural but with economic measures .
by the way , there is also some criticism of the fact that not only are not enough funds available but that they are not always spent efficiently .
we need specific directives to ensure a balance between the major language groups and those languages that are used in smaller national or regional groups in europe , with a view to achieving equality of opportunity .
resources such as electronic dictionaries , terminology data banks and language and grammar data banks are needed in order to transform communication technologies into marketable products .
here the necessary efforts will have to be made to attract investment from the private sector and small and medium-sized undertakings .
small undertakings , as mrs mouskouri also noted , that are confronted with large and diversifying markets also need to be offered adequate assistance .
the member states , the european commission and private undertakings have already invested substantially in the production of language resources .
however , most of these are single-language systems and , moreover , the current systems are not sufficiently compatible .
the linguistic diversity in europe is notable compared , for example , with that in the usa or japan .
europe has the scientific and technological know-how and the economic strength , but it must also have the political will to maintain its linguistic diversity in the information age , which is what the people of europe want .
let me underline that the committee on culture , youth , education and the media calls for the modest financing basis to be increased from ecu 15 m to ecu 20 m .
the people must be guaranteed their basic right of access to information in their european mother tongue .
european society must not be split into the informed and the uninformed .
europe 's richness lies in its diversity .
we must promote it and invest in it in a well-considered way .
mr president , first of all my compliments to mrs mouskouri for her excellent work and for the power of her conviction .
and i very much approve of the commission proposal .
linguistic diversity in the union is a matter close to my heart .
it is not just an economic burden which we seek to ease by technology . it is above all a cultural asset , something precious which should be treasured .
our citizens attach importance to this , for a variety of reasons .
we must support them in this , at union level too .
in this respect the programme is a step in the right direction .
thirdly and lastly , a small complaint . i absolutely do not agree with the legal basis and am totally with the rapporteur on this .
of course it makes sense to make room for a programme like this in industrial policy . it fosters economic integration , opportunities for small businesses and the competitive position of the language industry sector .
but legally and politically it is a mistake to use only article 130 as a legal basis . firstly , because this cuts out the committee of the regions and parliament totally and partially .
secondly , and most importantly , because it does not appreciate the cultural dimension of this subject .
language is both the basis of culture and its expression .
and secondly , and i will end on this : in the commission 's view is linguistic diversity a part of our european cultural heritage , within the meaning of article 128 of the treaty ?
mr president , i welcome the proposal of the commission for the adoption of the programme to promote linguistic diversity in the information society and offer warm congratulations to mrs mouskouri .
the linking and interoperability of file and information centre services will certainly be an advance .
however , we need to ensure that the periphery , which is striving hard to adjust and needs greater support , is not further marginalized because of infrastructure shortcomings and deficiencies in technical know-how .
there is a connection between that and the threat to the lesser-used languages of europe and to the future of multilingual european culture .
we must reject one-dimensional linguistic cultural expression , and mrs mouskouri 's excellent report emphasizes that very clearly .
that means giving our support to the efforts to promote cultural products released in the various languages of the countries of the european union .
it was to that end that we gave our support for the preferential treatment of multilingual audio-visual works via the media ii programme , and for the conversion of printed publications into electronic publications via info 2000 .
and the ariane translation programme was formulated in the same general spirit .
we must now support the increased appropriations for the financing of linguistic diversity in the information society .
lastly , we must keep on insisting that each country must have access to the information centres and to the services of the information society in its own language .
mr president , the future of the languages of europe is a central problem to the policy of the european union even if the union does not seem to acknowledge that , given the paltry size this programme .
the mouskouri report is an excellent list of questions . it reflects the great openness of its author .
but i would like to see a clearer definition of the priorities . language policies need to be dealt with at very many levels .
first of all , the language itself .
each country and each linguistic region needs to requalify the instruction of the language at school - that is a basis which does not exist at present .
secondly , functional bilingualism : every citizen must , as of the most basic educational level , be trained in the notion of the european linguistic plurality and become bi- or even trilingual .
that could cement european citizenship together .
the problems concerning scientific and technological translation , literary translation , translation of the multimedia need to be dealt with , taking into account their individual specific needs .
fourth point : the union and member states ' official policies .
european language policies must give equal treatment - and that does not mean egalitarian - to all national , regional and minority languages in europe , and also to non-european languages spoken by communities residing in europe .
i should like to end by referring to one last point and making one proposal .
my final point is about translation and interpretation at international fora .
the future of the use of different languages by international organisations deserves to be given thought in the cool light of day .
i think it would be a serious mistake to pull out a pistol every time someone mentions reducing the number of languages .
it is not here that our identity is at stake .
this is my proposal to the commission .
i shall be voting in favour of this report , and i must thank mrs mouskouri for a very significant improvement to the commission 's text , which i am bound to say badly needed it .
the commission , in fact , adopted a very economistic approach , reflected in the choice of legal basis in article 130 , paragraph 3 .
in order to avoid this , all languages must be fully integrated into the information society , and we must therefore be particularly attentive to supporting minority languages , including regional ones .
from this point of view , the structural funds could be used to preserve and develop the linguistic heritage of the member states .
that society represents both an opportunity and a danger for the states of the european union .
it is an opportunity because the development of linguistic engineering means that it is going to be possible to reduce the burdens and costs inherent in a multilingual society by allowing rapid transfers from one language to another .
linguistic diversity is not a purely european issue ; it is also a global challenge which concerns both our continent and the american continent .
multilingualism is an integral part of europe . it is not a handicap but a wealth , something which it is important to preserve , respect and encourage .
the europe of nations group is grateful to mrs mouskouri for having reminded us of this , with conviction and energy .
mr president , the diversity of our languages is an integral component of our cultural heritage and must be preserved and maintained .
the planned action programme will support this important objective .
but let me just point to one aspect to which perhaps not quite enough attention is paid , that of the minority languages .
they too are an expression of cultural diversity and i am glad therefore that the rapporteur has made constructive proposals on this important question in several amendments .
the programmes must take account of minority languages , even if they are languages that are only the official language outside the union .
precisely these languages must not be excluded from the information society either .
for instance , a significant slovenian minority lives in the southernmost province of austria , k&auml;rnten , and their language is protected and taken into consideration in the austrian educational system in exemplary fashion .
unfortunately one cannot say the same for the german-speaking minority in slovenia .
but quite apart from that it would be important if pilot actions could be envisaged and carried out precisely for this kind of linguistic minority , as proposed in amendment 29 .
actions of this kind could also give rise to interesting synergies in relation to enlargement eastward , which will naturally have a major impact on the austrian frontier regions .
by means of the so-called information highways culture and languages will spread more rapidly and widely within and outside europe .
the building of europe must develop by means of respect for the cultural and linguistic heritage of its citizens and initiatives like this help to encourage that diversity .
we must take advantage of the challenges and opportunities which the information society offers us on behalf of european citizens , safeguarding one of the basic principles of community law such as equality of opportunity .
for all these reasons , mr president , i should like to express again all my support for the report and of course to repeat my sincere congratulations on the rapporteur 's work .
we must also support community initiatives like this programme for the encouragement of linguistic diversity , which guarantees full multilingual protection in the use of computerized information .
mr president , i support the commission 's three-year programme to promote linguistic diversity in the information society through the encouragement of new technologies and the development of multilingual services .
i also support the committee on culture , youth , education and the media amendment to increase the budget allocation from ecu 12m to ecu 16m .
we must all ensure that the spread of modern technology will strengthen rather than weaken the continent 's rich multilingual diversity .
the growing emphasis of an english-dominated global network information and communications service must not undermine the range of european cultures and languages .
this programme aims to encourage producers to supply support material and manuals in various languages , devise ways of making online dictionaries and terminology banks multilingual and encourage the expansion of software products .
we should never overlook the fact that 20 % of our citizens speak minority languages .
these languages should not be allowed to suffer because of the dominant role of a few major languages .
these of course include the first language of my country , the irish language .
people must have access to information in their own language .
i hope the telecommunications council meeting on 27 june next will have the wisdom and foresight to support these innovative proposals from the european parliament .
mr president , it is a case of david and goliath , minor languages against major languages .
i choose this image advisedly , because i am convinced that the minor languages must not come off second best , even despite the revolution in the information society .
our many languages are one aspect of our wealth and information in one 's own language is a fundamental right of the european citizen .
but the minor languages are indeed coming under pressure .
at the beginning of 1995 i was in sharp disagreement with alain lamassoure who wanted to limit the number of working languages in the european union after further enlargement .
i do not find that very friendly , and who in central and eastern europe understands french ?
but it is encouraging that the commission wishes by this proposal to promote linguistic diversity in a european union in which the information society is irrevocably gaining dominance and in which english is usually the language of choice .
countless problems still remain over the importation of multilingual products and this is why this proposal is so important .
we must seek ways of breaking down the language barriers .
if such ways are found , we shall see a whole lot of new forms of economic activity which will be advantageous to small businesses in particular .
bravo , mrs mouskouri .
my group too backs mrs mouskouri 's amendments which want to see article 28 and not article 130 chosen as the legal basis .
the objective here is linguistic diversity .
industry plays an important part , developing technologies , expanding the language industry , but the preservation of one 's own language is primarily a cultural matter .
many thanks , mrs larive .
you know that the president 's gavel is not to stop you speaking but on the contrary to tell you that you have used up your speaking time .
on the other hand perhaps the council is underestimating the aims to be achieved .
if we have proposed in these programmes to guarantee the citizen 's democratic access to information it is essential that it should be available in his own language .
that will no doubt help to increase the cultural diversity of this pluralistic and democratic information society which we desire for europe .
thank you , mr mohamed al&iacute; , and thank you also mrs larive .
mr president , this report corrects what at times is an unforgivable oversight in the european institutions .
there is much talk of official languages of the union and it is forgotten that many millions of us citizens speak languages which are not official , though they are official in our own different spheres .
it would be cynical to talk about linguistic diversity without putting these languages on the same footing and would constitute discrimination against the linguistic rights of european citizens .
i would even go so far as to say that these languages need additional support because they are weaker in the face of the challenges posed by the information society .
the commission says that market forces by themselves are not enough to achieve the multilingual information society in europe which is essentially a positive measure .
so that is all the more true , if possible for the less wide-spread languages .
parliament 's action in supporting this aspect in its committee on culture is an important advance , as will also be its final approval , i feel sure .
support for the weaker languages deserves special emphasis , particularly in bilingual regions .
bilingualism is cultural richness , but it is also an interesting aspect of tolerance and mutual respect .
having two languages is for some people something which helps us to understand a little better the concept of respect for others , as long as we are able to accept both as appropriate .
we have to make appropriate machinery to ensure that in the information society in which communication will radically change , these languages may develop .
both tendencies are positive and compatible .
i think support for multilingualism in the information society will represent a fine balance between them .
so , mrs mouskouri , many thanks for your report , which i am sure will work in that direction .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to express my enthusiastic support for mrs mouskouri 's report on the adoption of a multiannual programme to promote the linguistic diversity of the community in the information society .
thank you , mr gas&ograve;liba .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the following quote from a recently published book on tele-translation goes to the heart of the proposal before us .
it reads more or less as follows : now that we are beginning to master the technical problems the real problem of communications is coming to light , and it is enormous .
various languages wait like stumbling stones on the other side of the electronic highway and fully reveal the problematic nature of cross-cultural communications .
to find solutions , that is the far more difficult task that the commission has undertaken with this proposal for a pan-european project , together with the member states and the appropriate private and public institutions .
the report by mrs mouskouri , the rapporteur , on which i too want to congratulate her warmly , endorses our analysis of the impact of the information society on the european languages and vice versa .
nor is there any major difference of view on the actions required , although the european parliament is rather more ambitious than the commission thought justifiable at this point .
after careful analysis of the 59 amendments the commission decided to accept 21 amendments in full and 16 in part with small textual changes .
for reasons of time i will not read them all out now .
but the commission does not find itself able to accept the remaining 22 amendments and i will now discuss the most important of these and explain why not .
the european parliament proposes taking article 128 as a further legal basis in addition to article 130 and links this with several other amendments as a logical consequence .
the commission is adhering to article 130 ( 2 ) as the legal basis because the main aim is to motivate industry to develop and offer multilingual products and services using advanced technological and linguistic tools .
but its adherence to this legal basis has not prevented it from nevertheless asking the committee of the regions to give its opinion , which i am sure you are familiar with .
the people of europe use many languages in order to communicate and the information society must ensure that they can continue to do so .
the actions proposed by the commission are directed primarily at them , in order primarily to create an awareness , to stimulate cooperation and to make the provision of linguistic services more transparent .
the european parliament regards the commission 's proposed funding as too modest .
the commission is assuming that for reasons of subsidiarity the member states will primarily have to provide the funding , but that the private sector is also likely to invest in it .
the proposed programme is due to run for only three years and it is breaking new ground .
that is one reason to start modestly .
may i remind the european parliament that the general financial plan seriously restricts new budget initiatives and the current chapter 3 restrictions of the financial perspective are particularly stringent , as mrs theato has also just pointed out .
let me also point out that in line with the joint declaration on financial regulations of 6 march 1995 the commission does not lay down any indicative frameworks in legal acts that are not the subject of co-decision .
in relation to synergy with other programmes i would like to point out that both the commission and parliament take the view that successful cooperation is and must be a keynote of this programme .
however , the potential of cooperation and synergy is not restricted to community initiatives .
it would be counterproductive for this initiative to be isolated from similar national or regional initiatives .
the multilingual information society can basically be regarded as an exercise in european cooperation , but that means that the programme must also be an attractive partner for other initiatives .
good and transparent management of the programme , broad political support and adequate financing are therefore necessary .
so we are fully aware of the regional-policy importance of this subject .
let me end by thanking parliament 's committees , and especially you , mrs mouskouri , and the committee on culture , youth , education and the media for your constructive and creative proposals .
i am sorry that we differ as regards the legal basis .
nevertheless we can accept in part the committee on culture , youth , education and the media 's interpretation of the programme .
we recognize that measures to deal with linguistic communication problems have cultural , social and also political consequences .
but in the commission 's view the programme is directed above all at industry and the language industry , even if that word does not necessarily fill everyone with enthusiasm .
for legal reasons the commission cannot support the european parliament 's proposal .
nevertheless , the european parliament and the commission are following the same direction , although parliament , as is only its right , is looking ahead a little further and more quickly .
i am convinced that there is a general agreement between parliament and the commission on the need to take practical action to promote the development of a multilingual information society that will do justice to european diversity .
mr president , i put two very specific questions to the commission .
i would like to know , please .
i am grateful to you , commissioner , for the replies that you have given us .
i would just like to say that the placing of europe 's diversity on an industrial footing is very difficult to accept .
it is something that we cannot accept .
europe needs to create an infrastructure of its own based on its linguistic pluralism , on its multilingual wealth .
because its culture , to which , in the creation of this europe , all of the countries will be linked , resides therein .
i think that europe 's identity is encapsulated in its multilingualism , and restricting that multilingualism to an industrial presentation will restrict the projection of its quality .
we shall keep on pressing as much as we can for that in the hope that you will be very understanding .
just a quick word to you , mrs mouskouri .
we do not want to industrialize the diversity of europe but on the contrary use industry , but also the public service and political measures , as instruments for making this cultural dimension of practical use to the people .
that must after all be our objective .
i believe we entirely agree on that objective , even if we have different views on the legal basis .
i would like to answer your questions , although i thought i had already done so in the context of the committee of the regions .
perhaps we can clarify the matters that are of special interest to you in a moment .
my answer may have been too general .
we are happy to go into more detail on certain questions if you wish .
thank you , mrs wulf-mathies .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m .
( the sitting was closed at 7.55 p.m. )
approval of the minutes
the minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
that cost does not appear , nor does the suggestion about the number of trees that might be involved in a year in roll call votes .
i mention this in particular because the green group managed to call for more roll call votes than anybody else .
they should think of the trees !
mr kellett-bowman , that was not the subject of the discussion but of course we will raise it and consider it .
i am not usually inclined to comment on the minutes , but mr kellett-bowman should remember that the green group is not the only one to request roll call votes .
so do not accuse the green group of destroying the environment by asking for roll call votes .
you , mr kellett-bowman , belong to a group which is constantly advocating trans-european networks which will ruin the natural environment everywhere .
mrs van dijk , we are discussing the approval of the minutes !
madam president , i had asked to speak before mrs van dijk began talking about the networks , which cannot be discussed if there are no motorcyclists .
i refer you to the proceedings for 18-19 june , page 18 : in connection with what mrs larive said just before mrs van dijk spoke .
motor cyclists are usually on the elderly side when they hang up their helmets for good , but mrs larive was not referring to 82-year-old motorcyclists , but to 82 decibels .
will you have that corrected ?
mr wijsenbeek , we are discussing the minutes .
what you are referring to is the rainbow edition .
but you can make requests for changes there too if you believe something needs changing .
madam president , the schulz report was postponed yesterday and it says in the minutes that it was deferred to the next part-session .
i would also like to know whether this report is to be taken on wednesday at the beginning of the part-session or on thursday during voting time .
would you please clarify this because it is in no way clear from the minutes .
firstly , the part-session in strasbourg and the mini-session that follows it are regarded as a package and their agendas are drawn up together .
the schulz report will be put to the vote on the thursday of the mini-session at 11 a.m .
madam president , people who are in the chair should express themselves carefully .
there is no such thing as a mini-session .
there are sessions or no sessions .
unfortunately this expression has become current , but in future i will express myself correctly .
( parliament approved the minutes )
votes
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , as an exception , for reasons connected with the community 's present budgetary situation , i would ask you to accept an oral amendment modifying amendment no 33 of my report .
i would ask that this statement be recorded in the minutes .
we are therefore anxious that this request should be granted .
however , the commission must understand that it has to accept the consequences of the new initiatives it is taking in connection with the financial perspectives .
madam president , do i understand from mrs mouskouri that this extremely long text is being presented as an oral amendment ?
may i ask for clarification , because i was not altogether sure .
does mrs mouskouri 's proposal entail amendment of the financial envelope ?
because that is not clear at the moment .
mrs mouskouri , could you please read out the sentence that is to be added again ?
madam president , mr de vries , yes , indeed , this will replace the first part of amendment no 33 .
i will read it to you in french in order to be more precise .
the reference amount for the total duration of the programme shall be ecu 20 million , of which ecu 5 million will be subject to the revision of the financial perspective .
the added phrase states that ecu 5 million will be subject to the revision of the financial perspective .
that is the oral amendment .
is that clear now , mr de vries ?
on amendment no 58 :
yes , precisely , madam president , this follows on from amendment no 33 and means that we should reject the second paragraph of amendment no 58 .
the first part is exactly the same , following on as it does from amendment no 33 .
so it should be put to a split vote .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
the commission initiative to create a programme to promote linguistic diversity in the community in the framework of the information society is fundamental for maintaining the union 's cultural diversity .
an initiative that the excellent mouskouri report , which i shall vote for today , has undoubtedly improved thanks to the tabled amendments .
as chairman of the intergroup working party on minority languages i congratulate mrs mouskouri on her outstanding report and on the fact that the amendments of hers that were adopted today concentrate very strongly on promoting minority languages .
anyone who , like the rapporteur , is at home in nearly all the cultures of europe , is aware of the inestimable value of cultural diversity and therefore able to sweep away the widely prevalent trend towards centralism .
aid to acp banana suppliers
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , you know that the lom&eacute; convention guarantees the presence in the union market of traditional banana suppliers from the acp countries .
you also know that the creation of a common market organization for this product in 1993 affected the position of the traditional acp banana suppliers in the union market .
this special system was defined within the framework of a regulation adopted in 1994 , which formally expired on 28 february 1996 .
the commission is proposing that we should extend the period of validity of that regulation until 31 december 1996 , for two reasons .
in principle , madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the commission 's proposal presents no problem of any kind .
that is why the committee on cooperation and development proposed that it should be approved .
however , it turns out , first , that during the past year the banana market in the union underwent substantial and abrupt changes .
apparently , the gate was open too wide .
there was an oversupply in the market , and prices slumped .
secondly , it so happens that the common organization of the market in bananas is undergoing reorganization and redefinition , and this will be referred to very shortly .
the committee wanted to make this reference simply in the form of an amendment , which does not modify the basis of the commission 's proposal but merely changes its recitals .
so it seemed that there was no legal obstacle whatsoever to a decision by the european union making reference to the opinion of a consultative body .
that , madam president , ladies and gentlemen , concludes the remarks i wanted to make in connection with this commission proposal .
it is simply a political declaration intended to strengthen the position of both acp countries and european banana producers , defending what is done by the banana com .
this is part of a plan to undermine quotas , in other words it is yet another way of undermining or violating current community rules .
we think that the resolutions proposed by the committee on development should be approved as it is defended by mr castagn&egrave;de with the amendments tabled by the committee on development .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i do not think i need describe the proposal again because the rapporteur has presented it to you .
so i will only point out that it is urgent to adopt this proposal because the regulation lays down that the income support must be calculated annually in july .
ecu 30 m is entered for this purpose out of the 1996 resources , but until the proposal has been accepted , we will not have the necessary legal basis for allocating them .
that is why i would ask you to withdraw that amendment .
thank you , mrs wulf-mathies .
the debate is closed .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
in nay case we would recommend a vote against them .
madam president , i rise to confirm the point of view put forward by mr fernandez martin .
as soon as the commission informs us that the adoption of the amendments might result in delaying the implementation of the assistance system , we shall take the responsibility of asking you not to vote on those amendments .
madam president , this explanation of vote will be very brief .
those systems were established during the colonial period and have been reinforced since these former colonies became independent of their european rulers .
next , it is important that the european union should remain faithful to its principles , and in particular to the social clause .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
wine
the next item is the report ( a4-0196 / 96 ) by mrs kla&szlig; , on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development , on :
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the wine and sparkling wine sector is regulated by a large number of european regulations .
over a year ago parliament delivered its opinion on the common organization of the market in wine .
the european wine description legislation should be checked and reworked thoroughly .
the current description legislation has developed from a compilation of the various provisions in the member states and at the initial stage it was possible to harmonize only a few regulations with a view to a single market .
given this background , which was most apparent in the approval or prohibition principle , a very complex , obscure and in part unsystematic set of provisions inevitably developed .
simplification is urgently needed here in general .
the commission proposal deals with the amendment of four regulations on wine and sparkling wine .
new developments and knowledge make it necessary to adjust the existing regulations .
the european parliament was consulted on only two of these four regulations .
but since the main points are to be found in the other two regulations , the committee on agriculture decided to give its position on them too .
one important point in the commission document concerns the indication of the producer .
the committee on agriculture considered that in the case of quality sparkling wines the name of the producer must be indicated on the label .
over and above that , however , the name of the vendor may also be indicated , on a voluntary basis .
many hotels , restaurants and firms , and the european parliament too for that matter , offer sparkling wines which indicate not the producer but the hotel or restaurant as the vendor .
that signifies that this cuv&eacute;e has been specially selected by that hotel or restaurant for its customers .
so the name is a guarantee of the quality and contents of the bottle .
this house-label business offers many sparkling wine firms a considerable sales market .
in germany alone there are some 20 000 house labels .
this market must not be destroyed .
that is why the epp group has submitted a compromise proposal making it optional whether to indicate the vendor .
in some member states , an imitation sparkling wine is being produced and marketed in russia as genuine sparkling wine .
this imitation sparkling wine has never seen a grape .
it consists of water , alcohol , liquid sugar and flavourings and colourings and is carbonated .
but the russian consumer cannot learn this from the bottle because the label is not written in russian script .
one german firm wants to produce 100 million bottles a year .
that has to be banned !
we cannot have this kind of artificial product being marketed in a sparkling wine bottle .
for of course the consumer believes that is what he is buying .
we want to prohibit the use of sparkling wine bottles for this product .
the report clearly defines which beverages may be bottled in sparkling wine bottles .
in addition to champagne and sparkling wine , beverages which have traditionally been marketed in these bottles may continue to be marketed in them .
but these bottles may not be used for imitation sparkling wine .
following a judgment by the european court of justice , the term ' cr&eacute;mant ' is now authorized on a wider basis .
the commission has laid down the minimum requirements for the production of cr&eacute;mant .
there must be no deviation from the quality criteria .
after a controversial discussion of this point in the committee on agriculture , a compromise proposal has now been submitted .
in future cr&eacute;mant may be produced in all wine-growing regions of the european community in which quality sparkling wine has traditionally been produced , but subject to strict quality criteria .
the commission also proposes including the terms ' qualit&auml;tswein garantierten ursprungs ' and ' qualit&auml;tsschaumwein garantierten ursprungs ' in the list of terms authorized for germany .
as rapporteur i welcome that proposal .
that enshrines these two terms in eu law and means that in future they may be used in germany .
the commission provides for two new designations for table wines .
the italian term ' vino tipico ' is to be replaced by ' indicazione geografica tipica ' and the term ' regional wine ' is introduced for table wines originating in the united kingdom .
there are also to be new terms for indicating the taste of sparkling wine , namely ' brut nature ' or ' no dosage ' .
the term ' brut nature ' is traditionally used in spain for sparkling wines .
we have to accept this regional fact and enshrine the term in eu law .
those are the main points of my report .
i thank members and the secretariat of the committee for the good work done together and would ask you to support my proposals .
madam president , i would like to pay tribute to mrs kla&szlig; for her work on this excellent report .
we have all enjoyed the discussions - sometimes very wide-ranging - we have had on it .
mrs kla&szlig; has borne them with good humour and we have all learned a great deal and i thank her for her work .
from the socialist group 's point of view we will be supporting most of the amendments tabled .
on our voting list we made a slight mistake : we will now be supporting amendment no 11 which mrs kla&szlig; referred to earlier - so i would remind my socialist colleagues to vote for amendment no 11
i particularly welcome amendment no 10 because it will place a limit on the way in which champagne-style bottles can be used .
so i hope that amendment no 10 will play some part in ensuring that this regrettable development stops .
we welcome this report and look forward to it going through hardly amended .
madam president , this is a proposal for a council regulation amending four previous regulations concerning provisions on quality wines produced in given regions and on sparkling wines produced in the community .
i shall speak only about the latter .
we fully agree with the commission proposal to maintain the use of one , two or three varieties .
we also agree that the name of the producer should be shown , and possibly the name of the seller .
a compromise solution has been found that i think is reasonable for everyone .
this situation is harming the union 's producers of the real products to the tune of millions of ecus .
this must be banned and care must be taken to observe this ban throughout the union , including exports .
madam president , here then we have four regulations to bring a little order into the confused bundle of legislation in the most delicate of the agricultural sectors : wine and , in particular , sparkling wines .
wine production in areas in which grapes do not grow is therefore an industrial and not an oenological practice .
transporting too many grapes from one region to another distorts one of the basic characteristics of wine which derives its character and identity from its place of registration .
that same regulation limits to three the grape varieties to be shown on the label .
frankly , that is still too many for anyone wishing to defend their own personality .
but the proposal with the most bite comes from regulation 2332 / 92 on sparkling wines .
these are the stars of the market , following in the footsteps of their noble cousin , french champagne .
quite rightly , the precautions taken here are greater still , but it may perhaps be a little exaggerated to propose a minimum of 90 days on the lees in all cases .
for some sparkling wines that are obtained in autoclaves using agitation , a shorter period will suffice .
of importance in this regulation is the extension granted to 31 august 1998 for the process of adjusting superior wines using products that did not originate in the area of production , albeit subject to drastic limits .
moving on to sparkling wines , we are also right to be concerned about the constitution of a product that is held in such high regard .
that is why i am opposed to any concession concerning the use of typical sparkling wine bottles for wines or other food products .
mr president , the liberal group very much supports the work of the rapporteur and most of the amendments , although not those of the are .
i was interested to hear mr hallam 's comments in the long tradition in the uk of socialists supporting champagne .
we agree with his comments .
i personally - and the liberal group - welcome the fact that certain english wines can now have regional designations .
i am still very concerned that no vineyards are able to have quality labels within the united kingdom .
in my constituency in fowey in the camel valley we have excellent wines which are still not able to have those designations .
with your indulgence i would like to move on to a more important topic .
last night in my constituency a gentleman called albert tong was arrested by the british authorities to be deported to hong kong , causing the break-up of a british family .
he is now in hospital with heart condition .
i wish to express my dismay and disgust at those actions .
mr president , first i would like to congratulate the rapporteur .
it is always a pleasure to deal with people who know what they are talking about and that is quite definitely the case here .
even if the report looks rather technical at first glance , it does cover major problems as regards content .
in the age of bse , when we have seen what anonymity and uncontrolled sales can lead to , it is particularly important to be stringent in this field .
now one could say , in relation to sparkling wine in russia , that it does not matter what you get drunk on , but of course here we are concerned not with alcohol but with a semi-luxury .
that is why i am very glad that this report was drawn up ; our group supports it and the amendments it proposes .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , sparkling wines are always associated with festivities and conviviality .
among these quality sparkling wines are the cr&eacute;mants ; some of them are produced here in alsace , an area that many of you know and appreciate .
why are we having this debate today ?
because cr&eacute;mant , which has acquired its patent of nobility here , is not an issue just for one region but for the european union , too .
why is that ?
because europe has the greatest diversity of wine-growing areas in the world , and because quality sparkling wines are produced everywhere in europe , such as ' sekt ' in germany and ' spumante ' in southern europe .
so what is a cr&eacute;mant ?
alongside the appellation ' champagne ' , which is very carefully protected , there are other natural sparkling wines , either white or ros&eacute; , prepared by the same traditional method using skills handed down over generations .
the word cr&eacute;mant itself comes from the champagne region , and refers to a creaming wine which produces a foam of fine bubbles when opened .
in alsace , production of cr&eacute;mant accounts for 10 % of the total volume of wine produced under the alsace appellation , with more than 500 individual producers and 18 cooperative cellars , with more than 7000 contributing growers .
the method is a delicate one , requiring heavy investment .
a whole profession has grown up around it , and it has resulted in the creation of many jobs .
other member states , today , would like to use the term ' cr&eacute;mant ' .
as in cooking , what could be more natural than to try to reproduce a dish that one has particularly enjoyed ?
well , yes , but provided the recipe is applied very precisely and the necessary knowledge has been obtained .
that is the issue we are voting on today , and our producers can be proud of this interest , proof of the excellence of their cr&eacute;mant .
let us be clear about this .
this quality policy must be promoted everywhere , protecting first of all those who practise it in order to carry it to higher and higher levels .
in the present context of globalization , this is actually europe 's only chance .
as all speakers have pointed out , this concerns many regions of europe and especially of france : the jura , the loire , burgundy and of course not forgetting my own region of languedoc-roussillon .
the cooperative cellar at arques , for example , produces 6 million bottles and serves more than 500 producers .
as to the minimum definition , everyone agrees on it .
even so , i have certain reservations .
the period of fermentation with the traditional methods is based on that for closed vats , and i can tell mr santini that the longer the period of fermentation the higher the quality of the finished product .
so it should be clearly understood that a fermentation period of 90 days is a minimum .
a much greater anxiety , mrs kla&szlig; , relates to the naming of the winemaker on the label .
i am well aware that this is included in the basic regulation , but the concept of winemaker is not clear .
i have heard about hotel labels , restaurant labels , mcdonald 's cr&eacute;mant .
so i have misgivings , mrs lulling , because the european commission can always be expected to do its worst - never forget the meat business , remember it for ever .
that is my most important reservation .
yes to specific regions and no to vineyard coca-cola .
mr president , let me hasten to reassure mr martinez .
if he has really read the report and the basic regulation , what he fears cannot happen , provided he votes for our carefully thought out amendments .
i am most grateful to our rapporteur , mrs kla&szlig; , who is herself a winegrower , for having so carefully assessed the danger threatening this high-grade product .
those two member states were , incidentally , the only two allowed to use the designation ' cr&eacute;mant ' until the court 's 1994 decision .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , first of all i would like to thank mrs kla&szlig; for the excellent report she has produced in consultation with the committee on agriculture and rural development .
i also extend my congratulations to my colleague mrs barthet-mayer for the effort that has gone into her numerous amendments .
and , if i may , i should like to make a few comments on the amendments that have been tabled .
first , amendment no 1 . on the official pretext of easing the administrative burden on winegrowers , this amendment may have the unwanted effect of making it difficult to monitor the quality of wines and grape musts .
moreover , the name ' cr&eacute;mant ' represents a particular oenological method and must compulsorily be associated with a specific region within a member state .
so we can talk about cr&eacute;mant d ' alsace , cr&eacute;mant de bourgogne , cr&eacute;mant de loire , cr&eacute;mant du jura , etc. , and not just ' cr&eacute;mant ' on its own .
i shall be voting in favour of amendment no 10 , and i will ask the rapporteur to accept an oral amendment from me .
this is because the amendment contains the words ' may be put up in ' champagne ' -type or similar bottles ' .
for many undertakings , and especially winegrowing ones , the registered office of the undertaking is located at the same place as the premises where the product is produced .
on the other hand , in the case of large undertakings , a single head office may cover a number of different production establishments .
i shall of course accept all the amendments tabled by my colleague mrs barthet-mayer , with who i have worked very closely .
however , i cannot accept amendment no 6 , tabled by her and accepted by the committee , unless the word ' complete ' is deleted .
my reason here is the statement that the term ' producer ' defines the operator who undertakes the complete production of the product .
moreover , in some regions , it is possible to subcontract certain procedures , bottling for example , a practice more commonly known as bottling to order .
however , in other regions , some wine is sold in barrel .
the definition of a producer must not be too strict , or it would result in unnecessary detail on the label and would disrupt the economic balance existing in our production regions .
this process of improvement and accuracy had to be reflected in the regulations , especially vigilance over quality , because it is by improving quality that this sector can be competitive and face up to other wine derived products .
mr president , mrs kla&szlig; ' report proposes a number of important simplifications to the current eu rules and regulations .
so in principle our group very much welcomes it .
but in our view the commission 's proposal to indicate three instead of two vine varieties on the labels of quality and table wine is not useful because it would lead to even more confusion on the labels .
we should take a decided stand against allowing artificial and imitation sparkling wines , which the consumer has always recognized as such , to be bottled and marketed in traditional sparkling wine bottles .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the present regulation applicable to wine may be regarded , both as regards definition and as regards presentation or labelling , as extremely complex .
it was logical , then , for the commission to propose adjustments , and i must thank and congratulate mrs kla&szlig; , who is absolutely right when she refers to the need to simplify the rules .
so i will dwell briefly on a few specific points , with a view to the joint interests of the producer and the consumer .
it does seem to us essential , therefore , that the name of the producer should appear on the label of this type of wine .
in fact , for us , as consumers , this information is a yardstick for the quality of the product .
although it should of course be permitted for the vendor to be named , we believe that this should be an optional addition to the naming of the producer .
the best solution would be to make it obligatory throughout the member states for the producer 's name to be stated in black and white .
if this is perhaps impossible or unacceptable as yet - though we shall come to it one day - it is at least essential to give every member state the option of doing so .
that is the purpose of the amendment tabled by mrs barthet-mayer . i fully approve of that amendment , and recommend you to vote in favour of it .
as far as cr&eacute;mant is concerned , i will not dwell on matters that have already been covered .
what matters to us , i feel , is to ensure that quality and tradition in wine-growing are respected .
this is the purpose of the amendment tabled by our rapporteur .
it is the result of a carefully negotiated compromise within the intergroup of which i am chairman , which has thus once again shown how useful and dynamic it is .
mr president , i shall conclude by expressing the hope that matters of this type , brought up on a friday when the house is sparsely attended , will be better treated in future .
wine , a fruit of our mediterranean and european civilization , would , i think , have been deserving of a wider audience .
i urge you then , ladies and gentlemen , to ensure a very large majority for the survival of the values that our western civilization associates with wine .
since i come from an excellent wine-producing region , the ancient kingdom of navarre , it is with much interest that i have followed the excellent work done by my colleague , mrs kla&szlig; .
i am worried that no new date has been set and that this exemption has been extended indefinitely .
this might be the thin end of the wedge and mean that even more than 15 % of other-region grapes could find its way to our cellars , raising problems with doc .
the quality wine we want to protect must respect the consumer and the region it is supposed to come from .
in any case it is laudable that both the commission and the committee on agriculture are taking an interest in overseeing our wine production and the two million producers in the union .
i think that production is not too high but demand is too low .
it is the non-producing countries with their high taxes on wine that are preventing lower income families from drinking wine .
that is why i want to thank the committee on agriculture and rural development and especially mrs kla&szlig; for their very good work on this report .
the commission takes note of the call to simplify the legislation on the description and presentation of wine .
it also welcomes the fact that the committee on agriculture and rural development has approved many of the commission 's proposals without change .
that applies in particular to regulation no 823 on quality wines and regulation no 2332 on sparkling wines ; only one amendment was tabled on the latter .
unfortunately that amendment calls for the possibility of using ' return ' wine in the production of sparkling wine .
the commission cannot agree to that without first having an opportunity to discuss it in depth with the member states .
all the other amendments relate to regulations nos 2392 / 89 and 2333 / 92 on the description of wines and sparkling wines .
it could , however , consider extending the deadline so that some member states can make the necessary adjustments .
amendments nos 5 , 7 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 and 18 concern the obligation to indicate the name of the producer or vendor on the label .
the commission can under no circumstances accept making it compulsory community-wide to name the producer or vendor on the label , even if in some cases it only applies to quality wines produced in specified regions .
the commission can accept amendment no 8 concerning the indication of the sugar content of sparkling wines because it clarifies the conditions for the use of the proposed new designation .
but the commission found it unacceptable for the term ' cr&eacute;mant ' only to be used in regions which have traditionally produced this product .
with regard to the use of traditional vine varieties , the commission does not consider it necessary to apply this new criteria to ' cr&eacute;mant ' since it already applies to all quality wines produced in specified regions .
the debate is closed .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
i support this defence of quality products associated with particular regions , particular varieties in the case of wine , and very strict traditional methods .
today , we are concerned with the cr&eacute;mants .
their name cannot be given to just any sparkling wine , some of which have never seen a single grape !
some time ago , we were defending the champagne designation - and rightly so - prohibiting even the use of the term ' champagne-type ' .
today , the problem is cr&eacute;mant , whether it comes from the loire , the jura , alsace , languedoc or luxembourg .
there can be no question of allowing any old sparkling wine to add to the confusion already caused by the shape of the bottle by deceiving the consumer with an ambiguous label .
these standards , of course , define a minimum quality level in order to be permitted to use the term ' cr&eacute;mant ' .
but the member states , the institutions responsible for registered designations of origin and the winegrowing syndicates must always be able to adopt stricter standards if they so desire .
the use of the term ' cr&eacute;mant ' must always be associated with a name identifying a production region .
i stress the word always , because i know that some member states and some third countries would like to use the word ' cr&eacute;mant ' on its own , without associating it with a production region .
their aim would be to make ' cr&eacute;mant ' a manufactured product of constant quality , irrespective of any typical features associated with region , vintage or harvesting and winemaking conditions .
in order for cr&eacute;mant to remain a traditional product , therefore , an association with a region is essential .
cr&eacute;mant d ' alsace differs in composition , grape variety and characteristics , from the cr&eacute;mants from the loire , burgundy , the jura , etc. and it must remain different .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
ornamental horticulture
the motion for a resolution on flowers and ornamental plants is in a way linked to those two issues .
it is a sector that covers 68 , 000 hectares , with a value of ecu 11 bn and a turnover of ecu 19 bn .
we are always talking about pacts for employment and employment policies , but we often forget to defend traditional sectors like this which is one of the sectors in agriculture with the highest level of job density .
it is true that we must encourage the modernization of european economic sectors , we must promote new forms of entrepreneurship but we must above all try to protect what we have now .
turning to the free trade zones that have recently been extended to cover morocco and israel , there is tendency on the part of the commission to treat agriculture as if it were an industrial economic sector .
since we took the initiative of tabling the oral question there has been some progress .
we knew that there was a proposal at the back of a drawer , and the purpose of the proposal was to get it on the table .
that , i think , was important because it follows up on the commitment that the ' general affairs ' council entered into back in november 1995 .
we shall be seeing the proposals which , we hope , will come rapidly to us for an opinion .
looking at them as a whole , as things stand , all we would say is that the funding that is being envisaged is quite inadequate compared with need .
according to the organizations in the sector , ecu 60 million are required ; we know that the commission is inclined to cut off the intervention at ecu 10 million .
we are not asking for the ecu 400 million that was once envisaged in a study put forward by the commission , but consider that ecu 60 million to be absolutely vital .
mr president , first i want to thank mr jacob and mr filippi for their oral question because i consider it important for parliament to concern itself with this particular economic sector .
as you know , the commission has submitted a proposal on measures to promote the marketing of live horticultural plants and goods .
the community budget will bear 60 % of the total costs of the programme , which should amount to a maximum of ecu 10 million a year .
the commission is aware that the trade associations would like more funds to be allocated .
the ecu 10 million proposed by the commission is , however , comparable to the amounts available for advertising measures in other important agricultural production sectors , such as the dairy sector .
mr president , obviously ornamental horticulture is a sector of high ambitions in many countries which have concluded or would like to conclude a free trade agreement with the european union .
it has gone unnoticed that the european union has already granted considerable trade concessions in this ornamental horticulture sector to countries which are actual or potential exporters of these products .
i do not wish in any way to argue in favour of a more protectionist policy on imports of ornamental products . and the european union has an interest in having free access to third country markets .
nevertheless , because of the great pressure from imports from third countries and because its own production has increased , the ornamental horticulture sector frequently suffers the problem of unduly low prices and incomes .
every effort must thus be made to improve the market position of ornamental horticulturalists in the european union .
the european commission clearly has a job to do here in launching a community initiative .
with this in mind it is useful to make a comparison with the fruit and vegetables sector which is not unrelated to ornamental horticulture .
in the fruit and vegetables sector the commission proposed strengthening this sector by means of support for certain activities of producer organizations .
this was to be done primarily by means of a community contribution to action funds held by these producer organizations .
might the commission consider a similar policy for ornamental horticulture , perhaps in an amended form ?
the area concerned is the marketing activities of the producer organizations .
with fruit and vegetables payments made be made for not selling , and there may be compensatory payments for market intervention .
this does not arise in ornamental horticulture and would not have to be encouraged .
but for most other marketing activities , primarily promotion , the system proposed for fruit and vegetables could also apply to ornamental horticulture .
is the commission prepared to look at this and make funds available ?
this would provide a fairer deal for this sector which all too often ends up as the poor relation in eu talks on free trade .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the appropriate exploitation of the natural resources of european regions must be stimulated and preserved in order to protect the lives of their populations and usually modest resources .
the defence of ornamental plant and flower production is extremely important in the european union and in the country i represent , especially the autonomous region of madeira .
the problem of unemployment is now at stake and we do not want it directly or indirectly worsened .
i sincerely congratulate mr jacob and mr filippi on the relevance of their oral question on this issue .
mr president , the commissioner can count herself fortunate this morning .
mr president , ornamental horticulture is having a difficult time at present . growth is stagnant and competition is particularly fierce as a result of free trade agreements with countries such as morocco .
a strong boost is thus needed to sales of this economically important sector by means of marketing and promotional activities .
in this respect the commission 's creation of a promotional fund is a welcome initiative .
but the 10 million ecu budgeted for it are totally inadequate .
thanks to the lowering of tariffs on imports from third countries the commission will lose some 60 million ecu .
in fact this is a form of subsidy to ornamental horticulture in those countries .
the 10 million ecu which the commission is earmarking for the european promotional fund is in stark contrast to this .
it is altogether reasonable to support the promotional fund too to the tune of 60 million ecu .
let us not forget either that this fund is the only form of european aid to ornamental horticulture .
other sectors receive enormous sums of money .
lastly , i would ask the commission to press for cut flowers to remain in the low vat band .
we are quite aware that the european union has to reach agreements with third countries , especially north african countries .
the barcelona conference was quite explicit on this score .
but reaching trade agreements with these countries does not mean neglecting or undermining the needs of the ornamental plant sector in the european union .
the commission proposal which sought a solution was blocked for a long time by the belgian government .
its view was that from 1995 the normal rate had to apply in all member states .
last year it even went to the court and brought an action against seven member states .
this attitude is hardly helpful to the ornamental horticulturalists .
fortunately a preliminary agreement seems to have been reached within coreper on the application of a reduced rate .
i hope the ecofin council will ratify that agreement on 8 july next .
i also hope the commission will quickly come up with measures to keep the sector competitive .
mr mulder 's suggestion of a quality mark is certainly worth investigating too .
i also thank mr mulder for presenting me here with another bouquet of cultural products of europe .
it is , however , true that increased imports from third countries are putting pressure on our own producers ' incomes .
in the commission 's view these measures , together with the above support programme , suffice to maintain the dynamism of the sector .
in accordance with rule 40 ( 5 ) of the rules of procedure , i have received two motions for resolutions .
the debate is closed .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
motion for a resolution b4-0732 / 96
we cannot support a proposal which seeks to provide support of ecu 60 million per year for horticulture .
it is unreasonable that every single sector of agriculture should receive additional support every time it gets into difficulties .
after all , this does not happen with other sectors of the economy , such as industry and services .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
aid to the slovak republic
the reason this decision is now to be repealed is that both these objectives have become obsolete .
these showed surpluses again as early as 1994 .
under these circumstances it is obviously no longer necessary to grant a balance of payments loan , for which the eu would have stood guarantee .
this indisputable economic success , on which slovakia must certainly be congratulated , is , however , only one reason why we should now repeal our decision .
that includes , for instance , the creation of sound economic structures .
i must express my doubts about their ' soundness ' and therefore about the success of the current economic course being pursued in slovakia .
this year there is a deficit again in its foreign trade balance .
then we have the form of privatization , which we imagine as fair , transparent and forward-looking .
the repeal of the former programme of voucher privatization is extremely problematic from that point of view .
nor can it be reconciled with government crises that are sparked off by arguments about which party 's sphere of influence a supposedly privatized undertaking is to come under .
i quite understand that a nation that only became independent so recently feels particularly sensitive .
and it is certainly not an easy task to turn a part of what was once a unitary economy into a national economy .
slovakia is extremely sensitive about anything that looks like interference or a patronage , and it deserves our understanding for that too .
but it is without doubt our duty and our right to call , without any arrogance but emphatically , for the establishment of the common economic values characteristic of our community .
we hope and wish that slovakia will correct its course and move politically and economically towards the common values on which the union is based .
mr president , after this excellent report by mr konecny , i can be very brief .
this parliament 's group of the party of european socialists will fully support this report .
i believe the rapporteur 's statement complemented the report extremely well and threw great light on the complexity of the european union 's relations with the slovak republic .
given the positive trend of the slovakian economy which has been referred to , and which of course led to today 's decision , it really is incomprehensible why slovakia is still imposing a 10 % import levy .
at its second meeting in brussels early this month the eu-slovakia joint committee unanimously called for its abolition .
we are assuming that this demand will be met in the foreseeable future .
we are of course very pleased , given the budgetary situation in the european union , that today 's decision will relieve some of the pressure on a somewhat tight area , namely the european guarantee fund .
mr president , the reason i like the report by mr konecny so much is because it paints a differentiated picture of the differentiated situation in slovakia , which is usually depicted in a simplistic manner .
ok , we no longer have it , but in a sense it is flowing back to us .
i think we may conclude from this that slovakia is on the right path in many areas .
i think it is important not to separate the economy and the political framework conditions , for you simply cannot have a working market economy the rule of law also prevails .
we must continue to keep a careful eye on this situation .
we should not try to tell them what to do but should distinguish on the basis of dialogue between the slovakian people and various wrong turns .
we have always supported self-determination for the slovakian people .
the peoples of this region must not confront one another but form a community that binds them together .
that is why slovakia must remain in the front row of countries we hope will become member states .
to support this is an important task , which is why i am glad that mr konecny has taken this matter up as he has .
this is an impressive achievement , and many a country of the union would do well to emulate it . slovakia is now able to operate in the capital market on its own account .
slovakia is reluctant to agree to the terms attached to the macro-financial assistance it had requested earlier , and the privatization process in particular was a point of concern to would-be lenders .
mr president , i too shall be supporting mr konecny 's report , but like all those who have spoken before me i must also express my concern at developments in slovakia .
the problem is of course that the meciar government has so far always ignored the pressure put on it by the union .
i think the meciar government has to remember that it has to respect human rights , that it has to respect democratic principles .
mr president , slovakia 's economy is doing so well that foreign help with its balance of payments is no longer needed .
the economy is growing considerably and unemployment is falling .
reasons enough to vote for the commission 's proposal to end macro-financial aid .
but there are also economic minus points .
the privatization programme is stagnant and the level of investment is very low .
so for the longer term not all the economic signals are green .
the greatest problem , however , is the political problem .
it is well known that there is tension between the president and the prime minister .
there is no media freedom and life continues to be made difficult for the hungarian minority .
there is also notoriously the law on protection of the republic under which criticism of government policy may be a criminal offence .
moreover , the slovak government is not prepared to suspend the 10 % import levy on foreign goods .
a further reason is probably the slovakian nuclear policy .
slovakia is obviously not prepared to continue the construction of mochovce according to western safety standards and at the same time to close down the obsolete bohunice nuclear power station .
what does that mean in terms of cooperation between the european union and the slovak republic ?
mr president , the commission welcomes mr konecny 's report on behalf of parliament 's committee on external economic relations , which supports our proposal to repeal the financial assistance to slovakia .
in 1995 the commission held talks with the slovak government on the economic-policy conditions to which the loan was to be tied .
moreover , the slovak government decided to cancel the voucher-privatization plan , which the commission regarded as a highly important precondition for payment of the loan .
because of this about-turn in its privatization policy , the interim review provided for under the standby credit agreement with the imf could not be carried out .
this led the world bank to break off the talks on a structural adjustment loan for the slovak financial and business sector .
once this assistance has been repealed , the necessary budgetary rectifications will of course have to be made .
let me point out that regardless of these events the commission will continue its critical dialogue with the slovak government .
the debate is closed .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
fishery products from ceuta
mr president , in march the council consulted the european parliament on the proposal for a regulation opening and providing for the administration of community tariff quotas for certain fishery products originating in ceuta .
once the report was assigned to the rex committee we contacted the people of ceuta in order to discover the social and economic reality there so that this report would be as objective as possible .
84.5 % of the population lives off the tertiary sector and is highly dependent on the current customs set up .
analysis shows the need for a new development strategy for ceuta .
on this score , we must consider using customs policy measures - in the rex committee - as an instrument of economic and social cohesion for ultra-peripheral regions .
therefore logic calls for an increase in the tiny quota of 200 tonnes proposed by the n to 1000 or 1200 tonnes in accordance with the projection included in the draft resolution .
the knock-on effect on the g market would be very limited - not to say practically nil - other than in southern spain .
on the other hand the development of this activity would be beneficial for the gdp of the city of ceuta , possibly as much as a 2 % increase .
we think that employment would go up by 0.5 to 1 % .
the economy would also be diversified whereas at the moment it is in dire straits as we have already said , for reasons already explained .
therefore the rex committee is proposing to the commission and the council to extend the community quota for sea bass and sea bream .
this petition would also be extendible to the situation in melilla .
to sum up , we should like to see management of quotas as an instrument of social cohesion in a declining region .
mr president , the liberal group fully endorses mr valdivielso 's report , and i compliment him on it .
ceuta is greatly affected by the european union 's new euro-mediterranean policy .
the gradual creation of a free trade area with neighbouring morocco will , as we all know and as mr valdivielso has already said , totally remove ceuta 's trade advantages .
in order to strengthen local aquaculture and for reasons connected with diversification of the economy it is thus desirable that we should create this quota .
aquaculture in ceuta has great potential .
this tariff quota may boost ceuta 's economy but will have very little effect on aquaculture in the union .
furthermore , demand for sea bass and sea bream is rising in the union and a doubling of the quota , as i have indicated , would thus be a good thing from that point of view as well .
mr president , first of all i should like to thank mr valdivielso de cu&eacute; for his excellent report on quotas for certain fishery products originating in ceuta .
as you know , ceuta is in an extremely complex situation .
it is situated on the periphery of the european union but it suffers from many additional problems .
there is also the other geographical problem , the fact that it is situated on the african continent .
other questions have created a difficult situation .
ceuta 's economy depends heavily on the tertiary sector and this has used up much of its potential while it continues to need to expand its economy in order to deal with its social needs .
if ceuta 's economy is to be maintained it needs a boost in terms of increased activity in the primary and secondary sectors , especially the primary one .
yet its geographical position presents the main obstacle to its development .
an additional problem lies in the restricted territory of ceuta and its soil and climatic features which make the development of farming impossible .
the fishery sector of ceuta suffers from the same problems as the rest of the sector in the community , due to a lack of resources .
the geographical situation again hinders marketing and this is all made worse by the nature and obsolescence of its fishing fleet .
despite all these problems , the conditions in ceuta are such that the development of economic sectors outside the tertiary sector is prevented .
this is due to the fact that products face the same cost of access to community markets as moroccan products .
however wage costs and social security are far higher than those in morocco .
although this is adapted to the tertiarisation of the ceutan economy , it prevents the development of activities based on other sectors .
here is a paradox : the european union has funded a project whose products face serious marketing problems stemming from the customs regime of ceuta .
the proposal for a council regulation has no other virtue than to strike a certain coherence between the community 's structural policy and certain paradoxes inherent in the customs union .
however , there is a problem which lies in the fact that this is a static position and economic activity is not like that nor , by definition , can it be .
this is all the more so when an activity is being started up .
this will give the ceutan aquaculture industry a breath of fresh air and at least help to start up the activity and seek markets with better future prospects .
but it must be taken into account that in the medium term this quota will have to be revised upwards .
finally i should like to repeat my thanks to mr valdivielso de cu&eacute; for his report .
mr president , mr valdivielso de cu&eacute; 's report on the tariff quotas for certain fishery products originating in ceuta very clearly describes the current economic situation in ceuta and the prospects of developing its aquaculture .
ceuta is part of the national territory of spain but not of the community 's customs territory .
protocol no 2 to the act on the accession of spain and portugal applies to trade between ceuta and the community .
the purpose of this proposed regulation is to extend the provisions applicable in the preceding year and to expand them by adding further fish varieties .
let me give my position on the individual amendments .
amendment no 2 : the commission can accept this additional recital .
amendments nos 3-5 : the purpose of these amendments is to increase the newly proposed tariff quota for sea bream and sea bass from 100 tonnes to 200 tonnes .
for if the council did not adopt the regulation , that would mean that none of the proposed tariff quotas could be applied because the existing regulation has expired .
on the impact-assessment report you request , i would ask mr monti to examine whether and in what form parliament can be given information on this matter .
the debate is closed .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
mr president , i just wanted to say the following on mr valdivielso 's report .
we are facing a very serious problem in the ceuta region because of developments in gibraltar .
that will lead to political tensions .
here the valdivielso report raised a very important subject , namely aquaculture .
any who knows this region is aware that it is almost predestined for aquaculture .
that is why i welcome this excellent report but hope that we will also take it further , for this is where a real start can be made , which might prove important in the future .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
adjournment of the session
i declare adjourned the session of the european parliament .
( the sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m. )
resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday , 21 june 1996 .
you will be speaking about the agenda in a moment and i have major problems with the agenda .
i wanted to plan my time scales for next year and found that not a single date given in the european parliament 's diary for 1977 is correct as from 1 february .
ash wednesday falls on a monday .
the date 29 february is printed even though it is not a leap year .
so i would advise and ask members and also the bureau not to agree any dates on the basis of the european parliament 's diary for 1977 because not a single date after 1 february is correct .
( laughter , applause )
thank you for pointing that out , mr friedrich .
we will have to consider how to remedy these mistakes in the diaries that have been distributed .
thank you in particular for your comment on ash wednesday .
that is indeed a quite crucial date and to get ash wednesday wrong would be a dire thing for us all !
mr president , if you wonder why the chamber is not very full , may i raise with you a real problem of access for members and visitors at the present time .
i have just come across the tunnel from the belliard building to this one .
it is impossible to come up in the lifts .
i would ask that someone looks at ways of ensuring easy access for members to the plenary while at the same time allowing visitors access to our public gallery .
the situation is very bad today .
from the offices to the level of the plenary .
mr crowley , first let me thank you for that comment and for referring to the matter and secondly the applause greeting your comment indicated the views of this house .
urgent political matters
the next item is the statement by the commission on urgent political matters relating to the meeting of the g7 states in lyons .
i call mr santer , president of the commission .
after the g7 had completed its economic tasks , the russian prime minister , mr chernomyrdin , standing in for president yeltsin , joined us for the discussion of global and political topics .
the g7 states now account for 46 % of world production .
this figure in itself indicates that the g7 , as a group of states , has enormous economic power , but it also shows that this association of countries is only partly representative of the world economy .
following the outrage at dhahran in saudi arabia , it was only natural that our discussion should begin with the campaign against terrorism .
on the very day when those discussions began another cowardly attack was launched against a military base at osnabr&uuml;ck , this time , fortunately , at no cost in innocent human lives .
terrorism is a threat to the security of our society and our member states .
it is a threat that must be combatted by every lawful means .
the g7 , therefore , quite rightly declared its determination to prepare and implement , together with all the states , every possible measure to strengthen the international community 's capacity to defeat terrorism .
and i am glad to say that a first meeting on these lines will be organized in paris later this month .
as regards the contribution to be made by the european union , i am confident that the decision taken in florence regarding europol will improve our capability for combatting terrorism at european level .
the new agreement on extradition will also have a contribution to make .
mr president , i will not weary you with the lengthy list of subjects we discussed in lyons .
our discussions were generally free and frank , and their results will be found in the documents adopted and published on that occasion .
as far as growth and employment are concerned , the g7 expressed its support for our strategy , designed to reestablish sustained , non-inflationary growth to create abundant new jobs .
i have been able to confirm our forecast that growth in europe would pick up again during this half-year .
our joint analysis indicates that public deficits and indebtedness are still too high , and unemployment is still at an unacceptable level .
this is another good reason to expedite these structural reforms .
we were all agreed in considering that the significant movements of the principal currencies during the last year or more had helped to improve the conditions for sustained growth .
personally , i welcome the fact that the idea of closer coordination of economic policies - an idea which i supported last year - is now being implemented within the international monetary fund and other international bodies .
in this context , i notice the growing interest in and support for the advent of the single currency , the euro , in europe by the american authorities .
with regard to trade and investment , i went to lyons with a clear message to deliver : a message in favour of multilateralism .
i was not disappointed : the g7 has given a powerful signal that matters must not be settled by going it alone .
it explicitly confirmed that , in the field of trade and investment , it is important not to resort to measures which would conflict with the rules of the world trade organization and the oecd codes .
furthermore , the g7 indicates that it is important to use and respect all the provisions applicable to consultation and the settlement of disputes when differences appear .
these conclusions encouraged me in the context of the problems our businesses are facing as a result of the helms-burton law .
the support for multilateralism expressed by the g7 was also reflected in strong recommendations encouraging the future work of the world trade organization .
the ministerial conference of the wto , to be held in singapore in december , was invited to give thought to relations between trade and competition policy , trade and investment , and intellectual property .
what is more , the g7 has recognized the willingness to deal with the question of the links between trade and fundamental , internationally recognized employment standards .
mr president , president chirac invited his colleagues within the g7 to think about the implementation of a new world partnership for development .
i congratulate him on this initiative , which is one of the greatest world-scale ambitions for the coming century .
i would like to raise at this point four prospects for the future that were identified in our conclusions in lyons .
first , we must do more to open our markets to the poorest countries .
the union is already the largest importer of products from the less developed countries . the g7 launched an appeal to all countries to improve access to their markets .
secondly the g7 renewed its commitment to maintain the substantial flows of public development aid .
the official aid to development supplied by the union and its member states accounts for more than half the world total .
this effort needs to be maintained in order to prevent the rich from becoming richer while the poor become poorer .
thirdly , we need to improve the administration of our development aid .
there is a need for a genuine partnership between the donors and the developing countries .
that partnership will involve greater responsibility on the part of the developing countries and greater coordination between donors .
finally , the g7 noted important advances in relieving the indebtedness of the poorest countries .
for our part , we will take steps to ensure that the aid granted under the lom&eacute; convention continues to be used for the structural adjustment that must accompany debt relief in those countries .
mr president , as my final point , i would like to mention a few decisions taken by the 7 together with russia regarding the process of peace and reconstruction in bosnia-herzegovina .
we have demanded that mr karadzic should immediately and finally renounce all forms of public office , should not participate in any government decision ...
and should hand over all his powers to a new government .
in this context , i should remind you that the possibility of further recourse to sanctions is still open .
finally , regarding the process of economic reconstruction , we have launched an appeal for half of the commitments to be paid before the end of 1996 , and the remainder by june 1997 .
the possibility of reaching a decision regarding the organization of another donor conference will depend on the results of the elections on 14 september .
( applause )
thank you very much , mr president of the commission .
let me once again inform all those who are still not sure about them of the rules of play .
there is no list of speakers , those who wish to put questions may in each case request to do so after the commission has spoken .
requests to speak beforehand cannot be accepted .
secondly , the questions may not take more than one minute and the answers should not be too lengthy either .
you mentioned that the first item on your agenda was combatting international terrorism .
can you tell us whether you are more optimistic now that the europol convention will be ratified during the irish presidency ?
as you know , it is one of the main focuses of the irish presidency .
as drugs are part of the international terrorism network can you tell us what precisely you agreed at the g7 conference ?
mr president , i do indeed believe that the entire international community , and more especially the european union , must do everything in its power to counter this modern scourge of terrorism .
but considerable efforts will be needed - good intentions are not enough - and we will need to translate into reality all the right-thinking declarations that are being made within the various international bodies .
mr president , in lyon you expressed appreciation - at least as reported in the newspapers - of the italian government 's document on economic and financial policy for 1997-1999 .
in the days that followed there was controversy in italy - i imagine your assistants provided you with a fat press file on the subject - because commissioner monti expressed a different opinion on that document .
please , mr president , do not remind me of the maastricht criteria , because everyone knows about that !
just answer yes or no !
that was why , last friday , i myself had already made a statement in lyons when i was asked to give my views on this matter .
it will not be a straightforward yes or no , because the problems are more complex and cannot be answered with a simple affirmative or negative .
anyway , following a meeting this morning with mr monti , who is responsible for the internal market , and mr de silguy , who deals with economic , financial and monetary affairs , i made the following statement :
' the commission encourages the efforts being made by the member states to control their excessive deficits and comply with the convergence criteria , with which you are fully familiar .
it takes note of the specific measures announced so far by the italian government , and notes with satisfaction that government 's intentions with regard to restructuring their finances .
that is the strategy we agreed upon at the european council in madrid .
the decisions will therefore be taken by the european council when the time comes , and cannot be anticipated .
eight days earlier the florence summit was held , and that summit did not arrive at the same results , to say the least .
mr president , you will shortly be hearing statements on florence by the president-in-office of the council , mr prodi , and mr dini .
i am therefore not going to dwell on the results of that summit .
indeed , unless i am mistaken , i shall have the opportunity to do so in my capacity as president of the european commission very shortly , from 4.00 p.m .
as regards the guidelines laid down by the g7 , i would agree with mr pasty that they are general guidelines , and that they largely coincide with those which we are trying impose upon the european union .
there are , therefore , interactions between the g7 and our activities within the european union .
mr president , in the run-up to the g7 summit the council adopted a new action programme to support the russian federation .
this programme was indeed discussed in the commission but it was not notified to parliament .
mr president , mrs hoff , the commission and the european union have always pursued an overall strategy with regard to the russian federation .
i believe it is essential that we should maintain constant relations with russia , having regard to its geopolitical situation .
we are well aware that stability and security in our own countries depend on stability and security in russia .
this was the spirit in which , last september , we compiled an overall strategy which has been submitted to the council , and which is certainly familiar to honourable members .
we must , therefore , commit ourselves to a continuous process of deepening our relations with the russian federation , not just in political terms but in economic and commercial terms too .
mr president , i am not the spokesman of the g7 , but i am a member of the g7 .
in that capacity , the president of the commission has to help ensure that the guidelines adopted by the world 's most industrialized countries correspond to the guidelines which you , and we , lay down in this house .
and i am very glad to find that a number of the guidelines which you have adopted as members of parliament , together with the council , have been adopted by the g7 also .
as i said just now to mr pasty , you have always supported multilateralism , for example , against unilateralism in international trade .
mr president , mr president of the commission , i have two questions .
the first concerns the fight against terrorism .
you know that we can only combat terrorism if we have a comprehensive exchange of data .
let me ask you how the individual citizen in europe can check where his data is stored in europe and what data is stored and what means of influence he has to protect his privacy in this connection .
my second question relates to the g7 meeting .
now it was agreed at the last g7 meeting to give financial assistance for two reactors in the ukraine , thanks to the means of financing we have in the eu , so that chernobyl can be shut down .
these reactors would not obtain authorization to operate here at home because they are to be built according to a russian type of reactor .
let me ask you this : how can we agree to provide financing for something that does not comply with our guidelines ?
mr president , as far as the struggle against terrorism is concerned , i should point out that a number of systems have to be set up .
you know , for example , under the schengen accord , that computerized systems are in place , especially in strasbourg , which make it possible to identify and trace these people .
clearly , this system needs to be extended to other institutions .
we now have europol , and we have interpol .
president chirac has suggested that the senior representatives of the working group against terrorism should be assisted by interpol .
as far as your second question is concerned , i would remind you that this is precisely the purpose of the g7 meeting on nuclear security which was held two months ago in moscow .
at that meeting , we agreed upon a programme and strategy intended to lead to the shutting-down of the two reactors at chernobyl , which do not comply with the safety standards in force in our own countries .
we also submitted an overall financing plan to ensure that this shutdown does take effect .
a whole package of measures , then , has been taken to put an end to the insecurity associated with reactors which fail to comply with our safety standards .
it is difficult to ask mr santer about anything other than the obviously excellent lyons cuisine that appears to have been the main item of the summit , but nevertheless !
is it true that you and mr brittan called for the worldwide deregulation of trade to be speeded up further without regard for its ecological and social consequences ?
surely that should give you something to think about !
thirdly , with whom did you actually arrange your appearance , or did you want to make your independent contribution to the democratic deficit of the g7 , which is of course well known ?
i do not know who is giving the folklore performance here , you or me , i do not know .
at all events , i take myself seriously , and i have no desire to play a walk-on part in a folklore performance .
i tell you this frankly , and i trust that you will accept what i say on the same basis .
i believe that is the only way that a conversation can be held between honest , politically mature and cultivated men .
perhaps lyonnais cuisine is not to your taste , i would not know .
are you familiar with lyonnais cuisine ?
that is another question i would like to ask if the president will permit me .
at all events , i ate what was put in front of me , and i am quite happy about it , and you would undoubtedly have done the same yourself if you had been invited to lyons .
perhaps the reason you are complaining today is because you were not invited .
now i am going to answer your questions , because i have no desire to descend to your level .
as regards employment , i am no fan of deregulation - quite the reverse .
i served as minister for social affairs and minster of labour long enough to know what employment is and how it can be created .
i also know that employment requires a certain amount of growth , and that we need to use our internal market to stimulate all the necessary forces to create a growth which is rich in jobs .
that is our purpose , and one of the elements of the confidence pact for employment which i presented to you .
deregulation is not an end in itself , but deregulation - or the liberalization of some sectors - may be regarded as a way of promoting a number of new jobs for the future , thanks to modern technology .
you are being reactionary if you cut yourself off from all new forms of technology .
that is no way to create jobs .
( applause ) finally , i am not one of the complainers , one of those who thinks that employment is sufficient .
quite the reverse .
if we want the europe of citizens , we must take an interest in what concerns the citizens , in the problems that affect them most - employment , and the struggle against unemployment .
that is my philosophy , and my commitment , and i hope you will share it .
it is a commitment that has nothing to do with folklore , i assure you .
i am concerned , perhaps more concerned than you , with our citizens ' concerns and preoccupations .
and i believe that you too , once and for all , should respect this commitment .
( applause )
mr president , i should like to return to the decisions adopted by the g7 regarding the campaign against terrorism and crime .
mr president , i can tell mrs reding that that is indeed our preoccupation .
i have just come back from dublin , and i think i can safely say that the same preoccupation is shown by the irish presidency .
we must all become much more concerned with the problems relating to the third pillar .
mr president , my question relates to the mad cow business , and also to our relations with the united states .
however , the blair house agreements have set ceilings on the areas which we may plant with protein plants , so that increasing demand would mean increasing our deficit .
so my questions is this : does the commission not consider it appropriate , in these circumstances , to renegotiation the blair house agreements , which are drastically reducing our room for manoeuvre ?
mr president , i must say very simply , honestly and frankly that i am not prepared to give an objective answer to that question , not having studied the question in detail .
this applies equally to feeds and to meals .
as you known , a new controversy has broken out on this matter .
in view of this , we are inclined to consider and examine all the proposals made , and i am glad to take note of your concern .
i feel sure you will appreciate that i cannot answer this question off the cuff , since it was not on the agenda at the g7 in lyons .
mr president , i have a question about the herring crisis .
mr president , herrings were another subject not discussed by the g7 , but even so i shall reply to the honourable member .
it goes without saying that the action taken by the commission to reduce herring fishing is intended to help preserve fish stocks .
i believe we have a certain responsibility in that respect .
mrs bonino has explained to you elsewhere the strategy we are working on with regard to the restructuring of fisheries and the preservation of fish stocks for environmental and ecological reasons .
but our first concern is to preserve fish stocks , and especially herring stocks .
how could mr bildt say quite clearly yesterday , sitting beside mrs plavsic , that he was satisfied with what karadzic has now announced - his pretend resignation - and that karadzic had therefore fulfilled all the requirements ?
in my view that does not tally with what you said earlier !
mr president , i can only confirm what mrs pack has just said .
that was indeed not the intention of the participants in the g7 meeting .
be that as it may , however , a symbolic withdrawal , a temporary eclipse , is not sufficient to satisfy the provisions of the dayton peace agreement .
i welcome the discussions which took place at the g7 and the expressions of concern about poverty in the third world and acp countries .
although they expressed concern for people in the third world , they still talk about the necessity for structural adjustments .
does mr santer not consider that the cancellation of debt - and here i am talking about the interest upon the interest upon the interest - could be the single best contribution we could make to the developing world ?
mr president , i share the view of the honourable member .
as regards the least developed countries , the conclusions of the g7 envisaged that the easing and cancellation of debt would be a necessary condition for their future development .
but the easing or cancellation of debt is not sufficient in itself .
there will still be a need to provide public aid to development , at least for the least developed countries .
in addition , other steps have to be taken , steps to give those countries access to our markets .
we can help them not only with aid but also by making it possible for them to trade their products in our markets .
that is the only way that a genuine partnership can be established .
mr president , i would like to continue on the subject of unemployment .
in florence it was agreed that efforts should continue to be made to promote the emu .
all the important measures aimed at reducing unemployment were postponed , including your own confidence pact , as well as other proposals put forward by sweden .
were these issues discussed in g7 ?
did you yourself , as the president of the commission , make any demands on the g7 countries ?
if this was discussed , what conclusions did you come to ?
unemployment cannot be reduced by legislation ; but it can be reduced by a joint effort by all the member states at different levels , mobilizing all the economic and social actors .
it seems to me that one element of this overall pact is the question of economic and monetary union .
economic and monetary union cannot be seen as opposed to the creation of jobs .
some countries have clearly demonstrated this .
ireland , for example , has dramatically reduced its public deficit while at the same time creating new jobs .
sweden has done the same thing .
this , then , is a whole package of measures and activities that need to be undertaken , and the principles and broad lines of which have in any case been adopted .
mr prodi , president-in-office of the council , who chaired the european council meeting in florence , will be reporting to you on this shortly .
a whole package of measures needs to be implemented to ensure that , gradually , unemployment can be reduced in the european union .
we all want to see that , and so we must not relax are efforts to bring it about .
you said something i simply do not understand .
you said that we must ensure that the rich countries do not become richer and the poor do not become poorer .
the second part is true , the poor must not become poorer , but i take the view that we are not talking here about zero-sum games .
we cannot artificially make the prosperous countries more prosperous .
conversely , it could be said that if the prosperous countries have a chance to achieve growth and then to take the poorer countries along with them , the whole idea becomes more acceptable .
that is why i ask for a rectification .
do you agree with me that we must ensure that we all jointly bring about economic growth and social improvements ?
mr president , that was precisely the objective of the g7 meeting , whose general theme was globalization to benefit the whole world , not just one part of the world .
all the statements i have just made should be interpreted in that light .
the european union numbers eighteen million unemployed and fifty million outcasts , living on the margins of our society , on the threshold of poverty .
they , too , deserve our consideration . we need to think not just about one country as a whole but about the different social strata , the different environments .
consequently , the g7 meeting approached the problem from the right angle by stating that the benefits generated by globalization must be distributed to all , rich and poor alike .
that concludes question time .
welcome
before we continue with the agenda , i have the pleasure of welcoming mr luciano volante , speaker of the italian chamber of deputies .
i bid you a warm welcome !
the talks you held during your visit to our house will certainly help to further strengthen the cooperation between the italian parliament and our house .
florence european council - activities of the italian presidency
the government i have the honour to lead has always identified with the programme of work presented to you last january , which has guided our actions over these six months .
i do not intend to dwell on the delicacy of the appointments awaiting the european union .
i would like to reiterate my thanks for the quality of the contribution made by president h&auml;nsch , mr brok and mrs guigou to the work of the conference , based on the positions of parliament .
this was added to a stage of development achieved by the patient and profitable work of the foreign ministers and their representatives .
this work is reflected in the report we have handed on to the irish presidency .
the florence european council clearly asked that we should now move to the negotiating stage on the textual amendments to the existing treaty .
the conference mandate to present a general outline of the revised draft to the dublin european council unequivocally confirms the determination to respect the one-year deadline set by the turin european council for the conclusion of the negotiations .
so the new treaty should be approved within the first six months of 1997 as it represents a logical and chronological precondition to the development of the successive stages of agenda 2000 .
those with the patience to reread the introductory statements made by our presidency at the beginning of the term would find the issue of employment at the centre of our programme .
here we are at the focal point of a dramatic and nullifying issue .
the relaunch of the european ideals today cannot rely on rhetoric .
there is no doubt that employment is the foremost of these anxieties .
we know there are no miracle cures and the immediate responsibility for dealing with the problem still remains at the national level .
but we know that global markets and globalization , the need for financial rigour and improved public finances , and relocation of production are priorities which it would be pointless to try to shirk .
but this should not justify resignation or fatalistic submission to the therapeutic virtues of the invisible hand which is supposed to lead us towards new equilibria in the long term .
employment is not just an economic issue : in many of our countries today it represents a collective tragedy , causing deep lacerations and growing social exclusion .
it has the devastating effect of making groups of people feel inexorably surplus , utterly alien to the very concept of citizenship .
we do not agree with this interpretation and believe that some progress was made at florence on a road which remains difficult , partly because of the inevitable diversity of situations across the member states .
nevertheless , there is growing consensus in europe behind the idea of an integrated strategy for employment and growth , thanks partly to the tireless work of the commission , which has my sincere thanks .
the new mechanism sought will be based on central rates agreed by the member states and used to set the authorized fluctuation margins .
on the basis of the preliminary work , the dublin european council will be able to take the relevant decisions .
much more effort will have to be put into persuasion and clarification in the coming months as we prepare for the move to the single currency .
they may indeed seem severe but they represent the only way of guaranteeing that the future single currency has the stability and the vital strength to ensure success on international markets .
the florence european council has demonstrated that there is firm determination at the highest political level to continue down this road , refuting the illusion of brokering reduced financial rigour and artificial stimulation of economic growth .
i have already had an opportunity to share with you my assessment of the justice and home affairs issue .
the intergovernmental conference must update the current legislative and decision-making provisions of the treaty .
if this does not happen , the union will substantially be condemning itself to powerlessness on issues affecting the freedom and security of citizens where effective responses no longer exist at the level of individual member states .
also of great political significance is the decision we took to create an observatory for racism and xenophobia , bearing witness to the common determination to fight against all forms of discrimination , intolerance and rejection of diversity .
finally i would like to salute the agreement on extradition reached right at the end of the italian presidency .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the orderly progress of union business has been seriously disturbed in the final weeks of our presidency by the bse crisis .
i do not intend to go over the various stages of the complex issues involved .
the foreign minister and the agriculture minister have already had occasion to speak to you on these matters .
the union was able to show strength and understanding at a moment when it was not easy to maintain european solidarity .
in fact , the process of integration is the fruit of a common consensus and imposes on all the states obligations of consistency and loyalty , which are moreover contained in article 5 of the treaty .
this cannot be sustained by obstructionist use of procedures which allow the business of the union to be blocked even in areas which have nothing to do with a specific and particularly controversial situation .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , when drawing up the final balance sheet there is always a risk of indulging in self-congratulation and over-valuing the results obtained .
as president of the european council and head of the italian government , i believe my country can be reasonably satisfied with the way it has conducted the presidency of the union over these months .
at the end of any undertaking there is always some regret .
in spite of all our efforts it was not possible to get the meda regulation adopted , as tacis was .
once again it appeared that our current mechanisms do not shelter us from situations where a timely and mature decision to adopt a measure is taken hostage for general political reasons .
we hope the efforts we have initiated to reverse the blocking of meda can be successfully pursued by the irish presidency , so as to permit the entry into force of the regulation by 1 january 1997 .
the end of the presidency closes a difficult and stimulating phase of our membership of the european union .
( sustained applause )
thank you , mr president-in-office .
i call mr santer , president of the commission .
first , though , let me say a word of appreciation to prime minister prodi and his team .
thanks to the diplomacy and professionalism of the italian presidency , we have been able to steer clear of the shoals and come safely to harbour .
seen as a whole , the european council meeting in florence was a good one .
it enabled us to clarify our view of the fundamental problems of the european union , while clearing away one major obstacle that has just been discussed - the mad cow crisis .
that was a definite success .
but there were other points , too , points which i had identified as priorities in my pre-florence address to this house , where progress has been made .
employment was a focal point of this european council , which endorsed our proposal for a confidence pact .
the work of the intergovernmental conference received a fresh stimulus .
and we must not underestimate the importance of the repeated confirmation of 1 january 1999 as the date for the introduction of the single currency and the long-awaited unfreezing of europol .
mad cow disease , of course , was not officially on the european council 's agenda .
yet the resolving of that dispute was a significant result for the florence council .
so you will understand how relieved i am that this policy - or perhaps i should say ' non-policy ' - has now been discontinued .
i was particularly pleased by the fact that it was the commission 's proposals that made it possible to reach an agreement .
the essential thing is that we now have an agreed framework for the eradication of mad cow disease .
yes , that really is the essential thing , because the commission has constantly been stressing this point .
nothing could have been achieved without this preliminary framework .
without a determined stand against bse , there would have been no restoration of consumer confidence .
without consumer confidence , the markets cannot recover .
and unless the markets recover , there can be no relief for those producers who - throughout the union - a point that cannot be made too strongly - have been hard hit by the consequences of bse .
the framework is now in place .
the next stage is to take specific action to implement the various schemes - culling , branding , surveillance , etc. which will lead us towards the resumption of normal trade in the beef and veal sector .
one step at a time , we shall get there .
that , inevitably , will take time . but i believe there can be no short cuts where health is at stake .
it is that same conviction which led us to set up a new multidisciplinary committee of leading scientists .
this will add to the already substantial body of expert knowledge on bse represented by the permanent and scientific veterinary committees .
it is that same conviction which led us to propose an in-depth research programme into all aspects of bse and its possible effects on humans .
all this costs money .
solidarity with the farmers costs even more money : more than ecu 1 , 500 million for the year 1996 alone .
but we must be willing to pay the price of solidarity - which is the very substance of our union .
the price we are not prepared to pay is the price of irresponsibility .
the commission 's files from that time are sufficient to show that this was not the case .
nevertheless , i take this opportunity to emphasize in this house that the commission will be guided first and foremost , where bse is concerned , by one priority concern - the safeguarding of health .
that task calls for clarity , transparency and responsibility .
any other attitude is unthinkable to me , and i shall not tolerate it .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as far as employment is concerned i am very pleased at the positive reaction by heads of state and government to my proposal for a confidence pact .
and i must thank parliament - and you in particular , mr president - for all the support you gave our initiative in florence .
the council recognized the need to give fresh stimulus to the job creation strategy .
by providing political confirmation of this framework , and by focusing its efforts on employment , the european council has given the right kind of signals .
this is essential in order to reestablish confidence , and to create the determination at all levels to combat unemployment .
the tripartite conference at which the social partners and governments met in rome in mid-june did the same thing .
we must not underestimate the value of these signals .
they are of the greatest importance in mobilizing the sense of responsibility .
witness the declaration by the european social partners of their commitment to negotiations of working hours and workers ' safety .
that is the kind of acceptance of responsibility in the spirit of the confidence pact that i hope to see .
i welcome it , while not forgetting the crucial contribution which the social partners have already made to european legislation on parental leave .
to each his role , to each his responsibility .
that is equally valid in the context of the public authorities and big institutions of the union .
that is why the commission will insist upon the implementation of the many schemes included in the confidence pact .
mr president , the confidence pact is made up of many different elements .
that is both necessary and inevitable .
the pill you just have to swallow , the magic formula for putting an end to unemployment - these things simply do not exist .
i emphasize this point because , all too often , the confidence pact is identified with just one of its component parts , the transeuropean networks .
a brief glance at the list of actions attached to the commission 's latest communication on the pact will suffice to show what the real situation is .
i reject , therefore , the idea advanced in some quarters that the pact will stand or fall by the adoption , or otherwise , of the supplementary financing for the transeuropean networks .
the success of the pact will depend , first and foremost , on the implementation of the multiple initiatives i have just outlined , and the synergy between them .
nevertheless , i regret the fact that the european council did not settle the matter of the supplementary financing of the transeuropean networks .
a favourable decision would have given a powerful signal of political intent , for which we have waited too long .
it would have confirmed the intent to invest in the infrastructures of the future .
as such , it would have been an additional source of confidence .
it would have enabled a number of projects to be unfrozen .
in this way , it would have given encouragement to public and private investors and facilitated the intervention of the european investment bank in various projects .
i have said before and i now say again that i understand the concerns of the finance ministers .
i was one for too long myself not to understand them , at a time when they are being asked to make great efforts to put public finances in order .
and all that is equally true for the alternative suggestion i made in florence .
there is no denying the advantages of the networks for the entire union and for the individual member states - they far exceed , in the long run , the value of any budgetary repayments .
but this is also an issue of the credibility of the previous decisions of the european council itself .
that is what the european council did , and i welcome it .
i pay tribute to its declaration confirming the conclusion of the intergovernmental conference for mid-1997 .
i pay tribute to the ambition of the irish presidency to present to the european council in dublin - next december in other words - the general framework for the new treaty .
we are , then , on the right road .
but that knowledge is not enough : we must start to take action .
and we have no time to lose .
the commission , for its part , will continue to play an active part in the intergovernmental conference .
this very morning it adopted its report on a theme of the very greatest interest to you - codecision .
to summarize our position , we believe that the field of application of codecision must be extended to cover all legislative activities .
the involvement of the european parliament in the legislative authority , through a process of codecision with the council , should become the general rule .
there is no longer any reason to restrict parliament 's role in legislative matters .
this subject is too wide and complex for me to try to cover it in this speech .
we shall have the opportunity to do so on another occasion , on the basis of the commission 's report , which will of course be forwarded to you in its entirety .
i know that the commission and the european parliament broadly share the same objectives with regard to decision procedures .
we have already placed on record our agreement to the need to reduce those procedures to three : codecision for the legislative areas , assent for constitutional matters and international agreements , and simple opinion for other actions .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , that is my assessment of the european council in florence .
florence certainly deserves to be rated ' very good ' , and i congratulate the italian presidency .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the president of the european council has dwelt on the major achievements of florence .
in former yugoslavia our aim was to maintain a high profile for the union in the implementation of the peace agreements , laying the foundations for their consolidation with a broad and concrete regional approach .
on both these fronts we can take stock of the results .
the mid-term audit of the peace process , which took place in florence on 13 and 14 june , was an opportunity remind all the parties to implement the agreements they had signed .
a highlight of the florence meeting was the very important understanding on the control of arms reductions , which could not be achieved in geneva only a few days earlier .
that meeting also confirmed the date of 14 september for elections throughout bosnia .
the union had a duty towards its own citizens and towards the peoples involved to make up for the delays and hesitations which hampered it when the yugoslav crisis broke .
that was our aim and we committed ourselves totally to achieving it .
the declaration approved by the florence european council bears witness to that .
action in the middle east peace process has been another area of priority commitment .
the union has sought to respond to all the main events in that zone .
first of all we assured coordination and monitoring of the palestinian elections which reached their final stage a few days after we took over the presidency .
the union has also provided itself with the instruments of a strategy towards russia that is clear in content and visible in objectives .
the florence european council confirmed this action in an important statement .
other events have represented highly significant moments in the definition of the foreign policy of the union .
i am thinking in particular of the bangkok euro-asian summit and its planned follow-up , opening up new prospects for cooperation between europe and the world 's most dynamic economies which go beyond mere commercial competition .
in the dialogue with mediterranean third countries we have sought to develop all the aspects of the euro-mediterranean partnership in a balanced way , starting with the political dimension .
the agreed action plan , its importance just affirmed by the european council , targets gradual development of preventive diplomacy initiatives which should open the way for further consolidation of an area of stability and peace in the mediterranean .
there has been a vast panorama of initiatives at the technical and scientific level involving european and mediterranean universities , and nongovernmental and twinning organizations .
the presidency has also sought to reaffirm the role of the union in the search for solutions to the cyprus crisis through the nomination of its own ad hoc representative .
the dialogue with the united states was confirmed as essential and the prospects for further deepening were highlighted at the 12 june summit in washington .
transatlantic relations should include formal understandings with canada as soon as possible .
on the basis of work done so far we hope that the next presidency can finalize the relevant action plan and joint declaration .
the conclusions of the florence european council make significant reference to an issue which has received our particular attention : the development of common foreign policy on security and defence .
the coherence of the union 's external action is still hampered by legislation and operational formulae which are not on a par with our increased responsibility to protect common interests .
i believe we have honoured that commitment and produced concrete results , even if they have not been very visible in the media , which are likely to lead to important developments for the future of the union .
i believe the directive on parental leave will be numbered amongst our successes , as the first concrete implementation of the agreement of the fourteen on social policy .
the social partners have been a driving force at european level , making it possible to achieve an understanding on this delicate matter and confirming the value and effectiveness of working together .
the approval of the common position for the directive on redundancy , which was blocked for over four years , also represents grounds for satisfaction .
the trans-european networks and making the most of the single market represent the other strategic points in union action to relaunch growth , competitiveness and employment .
the mobilization of greater financial resources for achieving the great infrastructure projects is still conditional on the need for budgetary discipline which must necessarily apply to the union as to the member states .
notwithstanding this , the premises are in place for additional finance of ecu 1 billion for the major networks .
at the legislative and project level progress during the term in the sector of the trans-european networks has exceeded even the ambitious objectives that we set ourselves .
the european council has given a mandate for defining and approving the action programme within the current year , and has specified the funding available .
the transformation of the european project from essentially economic to potentially all-inclusive calls for particular attention to policies which most directly affect the citizens .
but i believe the most significant progress has been made in the cultural sector with the adoption of specific programmes of support to artistic activities , promotion of the book and reading , protection and development of cultural heritage .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the speeches members of the italian government have given and heard in this parliament have provided useful guidance for our presidency .
for this i must thank you , personally and on behalf of all of those who have participated in the difficult but fascinating common enterprise that is the presidency of the council of the union .
mr president , i want to thank prime minister prodi , president santer and the president-in-office , mr dini , for their reports .
i listened with particular and careful attention to the two reports by mr prodi and mr santer on the evaluation of florence .
i must admit my evaluation is somewhat different to theirs .
i was a little surprised at their upbeat response particularly with regard to employment .
the madrid summit six months ago has become known as the summit of the single currency .
florence was heralded as the council of employment .
the reality was that bse and the policy of non-cooperation in europe which the british government had instigated was hanging like a cloud over the florence summit .
indeed , that cloud contained over 100 pieces of european union legislation vetoed by the british government .
so the signs and signals in advance of florence were not auspicious .
perhaps it was our expectations as politicians dealing with this issue that were naive and unrealistic .
we actually expected something on employment out of the florence summit .
people have spoken about the resolution of the policy of non-cooperation in europe and resolution of the bse crisis .
the florence summit did not solve the bse crisis .
what it solved was the institutional and political crisis created by the british government .
it did not resolve bse .
that has not gone away and is not resolved .
( applause ) on employment we have heard pious words , pious words and pious words .
over two years of discussions in summit we have seen very little real action on employment .
only if action follows those words are the words great .
in his introduction , mr prodi commented on the firm determination of the council in florence on the detail of emu .
what a pity that same firm determination was not there on employment .
there was a total lack of action with regard to employment .
no resources , no greater coordination , no adjustment of the broad economic guidelines and the policy mix within it which we had urged on the council just a few weeks ago .
we should take one example : the trans-european networks .
there was great expectation that finally , after all this time , there would be funding for the tens coming out of the florence summit .
we know now that is not to happen , it is not to be .
in florence , four days later after that agreement , the council decided unilaterally to change the conciliation on tens .
i want to say now to the council that if it is going to take unilateral action of that sort , i hope it will come to this parliament .
( applause ) let us be in no doubt that if this house had unilaterally changed that conciliation agreement , the council would have been furious with us and we have a right to be furious with it .
if i sound angry , it is because i am angry .
the people of the european union blame us all for lack of action on employment .
they do not differentiate between the council , the commission and parliament .
they blame the european union and my group does not want to be associated with this failure on employment .
we must now look forward to dublin .
we will do that but please let us not overestimate the decisions of florence .
to most of our citizens , and to us , they were a great disappointment .
( applause )
mr president , europe 's progress over the last forty years has not always been linear so it has often been laborious .
and yet there has always been progress .
it has coped with this period realistically , avoiding reversals and pursuing the way forward with determination and drive .
it has been the merit of the italian presidency to have resolved the british crisis over bse , with the crucial contribution of the commission and president santer .
the task of politics , mrs green , is certainly to expressing opinions and judgements , but it is also and above all to solve problems and resolve crises .
this has been done and this should be noted .
it is our opinion that in these difficult conditions the merit of the italian presidency has been to project the european horizon towards the future .
the intergovernmental conference has not only been called , it has started on its journey with the aid of the reflection group 's very important work , which president prodi and president dini have referred to here .
work has started on changing the decision-making and operational methods of the european union ; the phase of enlargement has begun ; it has just been mentioned that slovenia has finally started its journey towards association .
three months on from calling the conference it cannot be claimed that there is yet any possibility of making even a rough draft of the new treaty .
that is the task of the irish presidency .
the need to talk and define the rules of that competition has at last been faced .
finally i come to the ultimate issue , employment : a painful issue and also the most important issue for the group of the european people 's party .
we also believe there should be harmonization , at european level , of fiscal policies , social security policies and employment policies , because that will increase levels of employment and help transform the welfare system .
( the president cut the speaker off )
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the italian presidency has had a difficult task .
but mr president , it would be irresponsible to remain silent about the lack of success , let us call it that , at the florence european council .
for the first time we have seen a european council affected by the ' adjournment syndrome ' .
the important meda regulation , the first stone in building a more effective policy of partnership in the mediterranean basin , remains grounded and ecu 3.5 billion is blocked .
the funding for 14 strategic transport infrastructure projects is held up as well , and the santer project to boost employment with finance for the great european shipyards has also been put off .
what has happened to the nine scientific and technological research programmes ?
what about the interventions in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises , and the liberalization of the internal market in electricity and communications ?
none of these proposals , some initiated by the commission and supported by the presidency , has seen the light of day .
all have been adjourned to the extraordinary european council in october .
it is necessary to dwell on these matters to highlight the point every commentator has made : there is persistent weakness in our common values and they rarely succeed in finding common ground with national interests .
these are the priority goals but the institutional base of europe also requires thought .
in substance that means europe must be in a position to take over the existing responsibilities of national identity , without necessarily having to transform itself into a superstate .
they see the delicate balance of the welfare state dangerously compromised and are still looking in vain today for a continental dimension to those solutions the individual nations cannot provide .
the italian presidency certainly cannot bear the blame for all of this alone .
the current malaise has its roots in the history of all the european countries , all the citizens , all the political groupings , but this is no time for fake optimism , still less for pointless quarrels .
we must escape from the dead end we have got into if we want to save the achievements of our economies and our societies , and most of all our democratic freedoms .
finally , mr president , we do not believe strictly financial intervention can really create new jobs .
it is sad that our country cannot take away any tangible sign of its prestigious term of office , which has ended in surrender to the humiliation of adjournment .
let us remember that italy was one of the promoters of this european enterprise and has unequalled commitment and worth .
the stage of transition it is in must not lead to deterioration . we know our country is able to respond to its partners ' calls and can take its place in the first rank immediately .
mr president , you have my best wishes for insisting on the convergence priorities , as italy continues in the troika , making a decisive contribution towards the great appointments awaiting europe on the threshold of the third millennium .
( applause )
should it not be a priority for the fifteen governments within the union to hold fundamental discussions on the objectives to be adopted with regard to what form europe should take in the third millennium ?
what kind of society do we want ?
and on what broad principles is that society to be based ?
and , once that has been redefined , what is the essential institutional organization that will implement these projects ?
this is a necessary undertaking for the fifteen member states .
the crisis from which we are now emerging has shed a harsh light on the existing differences of opinion .
the proposed enlargement of the union makes this approach essential .
those countries which are hoping to join us must known , before negotiations begin , what kind of political structure they are going to join , what its advantages will be and what its constraints will be .
public disenchantment with european integration is worrying .
a recent opinion poll in belgium - one of the founding nations of europe , like yours , prime minister - discloses that state of mind .
the report on the financing of the transeuropean networks , about which we have all been talking , and the creation of jobs that must flow from it is a sad example .
and it is also a failure of the florence council .
it is not enough to do as the heads of government did in florence and take formal note of the revised formula presented by president santer .
is there a gleam of hope when the commission finds that the majority of member states are prepared to accept the broad outlines of that formula ?
be that as it may , and this is parliament 's virtually unanimous opinion , it is a matter of urgency that we should at last move forward to the operational decisions .
it is not just courting popularity to remind the house that 17.5 million unemployed deserve something better than declarations of intent .
the war in the former yugoslavia and europe 's inability to play any part in it have left a lasting impression on europe 's citizens .
the european parliament , in its joint resolution following the florence summit , stresses the responsibility of europeans to concern themselves with a whole series of problems , in europe and elsewhere .
it demonstrates its determination to see the establishment of institutions and procedures such as to provide the essential instruments for instituting a genuine foreign policy .
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , foreign minister , i believe it is right , at the end of the italian presidency , to express a calm and considered judgement on these months of work .
my judgement is broadly positive , because these months have been marked by a wealth of useful initiatives for the european union , many of which were mentioned just now by minister dini .
on employment , honesty demands the admission that the summit was a failure .
why ?
just cut wages and pensions , and lo and behold , 3 per cent of public debt , as required by the treaties , is achieved .
but what sort of europe would that produce ?
a europe which only holds together for strong states and crumbles for the weaker ones .
so why not insert another parameter for the single currency , a minimum level of unemployment , without which monetary union cannot take place .
the commission should work on that !
and commissioner monti , who has demonstrated that he knows how to add up , should also think about the number of unemployed : that needs to be cut too .
the rigid terms agreed at maastricht can be revised by the intergovernmental conference .
so my group - the confederal group of the european united left - calls for the timetable and the establishment of the single currency to be linked to employment .
these terms must be revisited or europe cannot really be united ! politically and economically united , and including all its member states .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , so florence was meant to be the employment summit .
it was to be the summit that would give impetus to pan-european development and democratization .
what remains is a stale aftertaste of zero options on the central questions of employment , health protection and democratic progress in the union .
that should have been the only criterion for action .
such action would include a comprehensive eu programme to combat and control this epidemic .
since the easing of the ban was decided without any preconditions , it is now up to the commission to take steps .
but above all , there should have been a total rejection of an unsuccessful , recklessly industrialized agricultural policy .
the proper response would have been to abandon immediately the coordinated irresponsibility of an industrial and political system that drives animals mad !
for mad cow disease is the result and expression of a trend and a human hybris that patents living beings and denies the inviolability of the individual .
the fact that british beef exports to third-world countries have not been banned on principle shows the two-faced nature of a cynical policy that places greater value on profit than on human health .
in the form it was taken , the only decision that was actually taken - with regard to europol - is a defeat for civil rights and legal certainty in the european union .
no guarantee of democratic control , no binding responsibility on the part of the european court of justice for all member states and as ever no guaranteed data protection !
the same old lip-service is paid to the fight against mass unemployment !
a genuine pact for employment and the environment should have come out of the proposed confidence-building package .
instead the 15 heads of state and government repeated their neo-liberal credo that fighting inflation and adhering strictly to the maastricht criteria would help resolve the employment problems in times of recession .
credo quia absurdum !
i am becoming more and more convinced that the heads of government are playing with fire in their european policy and that it is they who are slowly but surely becoming the real threat to europe !
i regard this debate here as an example of a totally topsy-turvy world .
the successes celebrated by mr prodi , mr santer and mr dini are , i am sorry to say , no more than pretty speeches , if not a classic example of windowdressing !
certainly , in florence the european council resolved the political problem - certainly not the health and economic problems - of bse , but at what price ?
president prodi referred to the presidency 's programme of work and president dini mentioned certain priorities at length .
i have taken the trouble - as you recommended - to read and reread that programme and those priorities .
basically the commission was asked to look into the matter more deeply , and we know very well what that means in politics .
on the internal market there has been a standstill on many issues , from the free movement of persons to the european company statute , to taxation , to the banking and insurance sector .
on other internal policies , a few important steps forward have been accompanied by equally important failures , from social policy to telecommunications .
in the agricultural sector there was no success in setting agricultural prices for the next financial year and , above all , there has been no progress on reforming the wine , oil and market gardening sectors .
finally , one of the greatest disappointments has come from the union 's foreign policy and external relations , with the lack of progress on the meda programme .
was it really not possible to do a little more to break the current deadlock and conclude those necessary bilateral agreements , essential to the development of the euro-mediterranean dialogue ?
exercising the presidency of the union and bringing the european summits to a successful conclusion is certainly no easy task , and it must have been especially difficult in the six months that have just ended .
mr president , an article about the florence summit in one dutch newspaper was headlined : ' no crisis and no euphoria ' .
i think that is a good summing up of the meeting of the european council .
the threatening crisis over mad cow disease has been averted . but the high expectations with regard to mr president santer 's so-called ' confidence pact ' have not been fulfilled .
time will show whether the bse problems have been finally removed from the political agenda .
a provisional objective solution seems to have been reached with the agreement on a phased plan based on scientific criteria .
but the question remains whether all considerations of a political nature or differences about interpretation can be altogether excluded in the execution of this plan on the basis of scientific or veterinary pronouncements .
we are talking about a period of years .
in any case , no crisis .
but no euphoria either .
there we must think above all of the plan for employment .
we can feel some sympathy for the idea of the heads of government to see whether these projects could not be financed in some way other than by what is left over from the agriculture budget .
does not this indicate that the european council thinks that the networks will have a much lesser impact on employment than does the commission ?
the networks were put forward at the edinburgh summit at the end of 1992 to strengthen the internal market and as a boost for employment .
but , judging by the slowness in working these plans out and the difficult process of conciliation between council and parliament , you would scarcely think that these projects are closely connected with the serious problem of employment .
is it not better then not to arouse such high hopes in people 's minds with about the networks ' impact on employment ?
perhaps a better european line on employment could be established with the thousands of millions from the structural funds , quite apart from the fact that employment policy is primarily a matter for the member states .
as regards the igc too , the results of the summit are modest .
the detailed progress report of the italian presidency amounts chiefly a list of the various viewpoints of the member states .
but the direction is clear : enlargement of the tasks of the european institutions and further development of community powers .
and as far as we are concerned that is not the right direction , all the more so since one important point will undoubtedly be to extend voting by qualified majority .
the united kingdom 's blocking of the european decision-making process has been seized upon with both hands in various quarters as an argument for abolishing the right of veto .
the blocking by greece of the meda regulation with regard to the mediterranean policy might be added to that .
but let us not run away with the impression that it is too easy .
this is more than a technical or a procedural question .
with decision-making procedures the fundamental question facing us is in which fields and to what extent the countries of europe are willing to work together .
how far can you go in outvoting member states by a qualified majority when you cannot convince them ?
and what significance does that have for the democratic basis of such a decision within the member states which have been outvoted ?
it was already clear when the maastricht treaty came into being that there were limits to integration .
two member states insisted on a reservation with regard to certain important matters .
amongst the nationals of member states too it appeared that there was strong resistance to more far-reaching centralization .
with a union of 20 or more countries and more majority decisions that phenomenon can only increase .
cultural differences will play an ever-increasing role .
in the revision of the treaties there will have to be a thorough appreciation of the citizens ' views .
but there might well have to be an end to the matter-of-course way of solving problems by strengthening european powers at the cost of the independence of the member states .
mr president , you have talked about relaunching the european ideals in the public mind .
does this perhaps mean that your government , as part of the troika , will ensure that europe is finally discussed in italy and in the italian press ?
we hope so !
but before setting out on a new course there needs to be clarity about the past .
on 5 december 1995 , before the houses of parliament and then before a forum of european heads of government at the european institutions , the dini government presented the italian presidency 's programme .
specific commitments were made in that programme , setting out the firm intention to advance the cause of europe in every area , starting with the priorities of employment and internal and external security .
but the florence summit concluded with no consensus on what to do now and in the future , apart from adjourning to dublin what had already been adjourned to florence .
the next summons , to dublin in october , threatens to find the european partners still very distant from each other on political union , on the enlargement , and on economic union .
the silence is especially deafening on how to achieve political union without setting a serious timetable for common foreign and defence policy .
mr president , how can anyone imagine implementing the option of enlargement without first achieving a binding political union ?
how can economic union be managed in the interests of the people , not just of the richest countries or the great multinationals , if that economic union does not flow from political union ?
the question we are all waiting for an answer to is unemployment . how is the dreadful tragedy of 20 million unemployed to be resolved ?
and here i did not understand whether there was an answer , and if there was an answer , what it meant .
and the willingness to provide common funding for those proposals simply is not there .
so unemployment remains a national problem and not a european problem , factually demonstrating that for many governments and many forces political union is no longer the aim .
it is mr santer 's aim , it is this parliament 's aim , but it is not the aim of certain forces .
it is impossible to establish minimum and essential welfare provision by adding poverty to poverty , unemployment to unemployment .
it seems like an endless list , and sadly it is an endless list .
the italian presidency should have got the regulation implementing the funding adopted and proceeded to negotiate the agreements , following up what the french and spanish presidencies began on the euromediterranean dialogue . instead everything remains at a standstill .
i leave it to you , ladies and gentlemen , to decide who today 's sharks are .
for us in the alleanza nazionali , the sharks are those who talk about europe but do nothing to build political union or , better still , try to reverse the few steps taken in the last few years .
we have the courage to admit it : there are certain political forces and certain economic forces which no longer see european political union as the aim .
we invite the troika to throw light on this scandal !
i have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .
heartfelt thanks to all those who have spoken in this short but intense debate .
i shall briefly comment on some fundamental points and then president dini will be able to add to my remarks at the end of the debate .
i would have liked the debate to have concentrated more on strategy and the possibilities a six month period can offer .
it is easy to underestimate the bse crisis now that it has been resolved . it is easy to say , like mrs green , that a political and institutional solution has been found .
a crisis which could have had devastating consequences for europe has been ended .
so within these institutional limits , the limits of the framework we operate in , we have made a huge contribution to overcoming one of the most difficult problems .
of course , as people have emphasized , there are two issues which have not been resolved and which need to be dealt with in the future , the first is the mediterranean .
the dispute between greece and turkey , which has blocked the meda project , is a very serious matter because there cannot be a secure europe without a secure mediterranean .
more work will shortly be done , involving relations between the two parties because that is one of the essentials .
we must pursue this work , but i would say that the commitment of the italian presidency in this respect has gone well beyond the institutional limits restricting us .
the second great problem is employment .
i entirely share the sense of dissatisfaction about the solution of this problem .
but i also agree that part of that solution is the need to build institutional bases to make a european economic policy possible .
we cannot isolate unemployment from the other great decisions .
i fully recognize that it is a very dramatic problem .
personally , i think president santer 's proposals initiating a way forward ought to have been accepted , even within the current limits .
everyone knew they were minor proposals - ecu 1 billion for public works at continental level is certainly not a solution , but it goes in the right direction .
the president knows we have tried to back his position , not only out of respect for him personally but out of real conviction that this is a new path we must take .
there is a whole community programme getting started but it cannot be organic yet because the institutional aspects are not there .
we must carry the torch of european union forward with good will and consistency .
i believe we have handed on many solutions and many means of solution to ireland , and not because we were resigned to doing so .
having the means of solution is the result of setting out the problems for the future .
i believe that at the meetings ahead of us in dublin halfway through the next term and at the end of it , we will see the seeds we have planted during our term bear fruit .
i must repeat that the work of the european union has a continuity which cannot be measured piecemeal ; it must be measured by the long-term objectives we set ourselves .
during its term italy has not lost our bearings or the direction of the path we must follow . we have pursued it with tenacity , we have pursued it with strength .
we achieved gratifying results when a collapse of european solidarity was mooted , and instead we sowed the seeds of an active economic policy .
we will continue this work as members of the troika .
we will be close to ireland to deal with the problem of the mediterranean and the problems of employment .
i do not think we will see the fruit until the intergovernmental conference has finished its work , because only then will we be able to say that we have the institutions we need to take long-term action .
but i ought explain why the european council in florence nevertheless provided a number of indications along the right lines , especially with regard to the confidence pact for employment .
in strasbourg , during the last parliamentary part-session , before florence , i told you that my specific hope was that florence would be for employment what madrid was for the single currency .
the confidence pact which i have outlined to you is not confined to supplementary financing for the transeuropean networks .
it is a whole package of measures designed to promote employment as a whole through a variety of schemes .
if you reread the conclusions of the european council , you will see that , in our confidence pact , the nucleus , the heart , was retained and confirmed in florence .
the european council is not there to take decisions on specific matters - it provides guidelines to the council of ministers , which is then required to implement them .
the council confirms it .
that is precisely what i asked .
what might the alternative have been if the confidence pact for employment had not , in essence , been ratified ?
this is not the place , that is not the point , that is not the fundamental argument .
the discussion is focusing on what has or has not progressed in the union , but every summit registers different levels of progress .
nothing is remembered of the very recent presidencies of two prestigious countries , because virtually nothing was done .
that is the point !
the point is that we must assess the context in which we are all operating .
in fact we have been discussing employment for three or four years , and many attempts have been made to get something done .
so let us talk about this .
why on earth is this happening ?
i do not think it is the fault of the italian presidency , which has at least held the rome trialogue and with interesting results .
of course we are particularly sensitive about the fact that the employment summit has not produced better things .
indeed , just a few months ago in strasbourg , president dini forecast - and we believed him , since there is no doubting what he wants - that the florence summit would succeed in providing an impetus .
obviously obstacles were met with .
i must say that in this parliament it is always better when there is no agreement between the governments on such important questions .
so why is there no progress on this issue of employment ?
personally i think the governments and forces that still dominate the council do not believe the union is not capable of substantial intervention in the economy .
this is a basic political point . either we get past that point or we continue to have debates like this , whoever holds the presidency .
these are the serious issues !
the idea that the market will deal with it - when the market is not dealing with it - must be replaced , and that will take a political battle .
but these things are not advancing either in whole or in part . that means there is a belief that there should be no progress , because we discuss it so much .
to end , i want to say that i appreciate and support the recovery effort made by the italian government .
50 , 000 billion is no mean sum , it is an important and committed effort , but the government is also rightly concerned to unite recovery with the possibility of development .
this is what europe is not doing .
and if europe carries on like this it will also be more difficult for italy to carry forward its own political project .
i think we must not underestimate the importance of that and i think mr prodi 's government has acted with delicacy , with what the italians call finezza .
i have a friend who says that what distinguishes the intelligent from the unintelligent is their ability to tell the difference between the essential and the peripheral .
and the italian presidency has distinguished the essential from the peripheral .
the essential thing is the health of european consumers - which was at risk - and we shall continue to defend it .
my group therefore strongly supports the commission proposal consisting in giving extraordinary aid to the producers affected by the ' mad cow ' crisis .
i think it is a positive political response because it also shows europe 's solidarity .
i hope that my british friends and their fellow citizens in general also understand it .
i think too that we , and above all the governments , must draw a positive conclusion from this unacceptable crisis of the british government blockade .
the positive conclusion is that we cannot go on in a europe of fifteen with the possibility of blockades , of permanent vetoes , of vetoes based on the ' luxembourg compromise ' .
it is not possible because in that way we shall not manage to make any progress in the building of europe .
thinking of that situation with 15 , we might imagine what might happen in a europe of 20 or 25 .
the intergovernmental conference will therefore have to come to a decision on this subject .
and i therefore also call the presidency 's attention to the resolutions of the european parliament , which i think give a balanced solution on this subject .
but the italian presidency , which i was saying earlier had shown such finezza , did not do so on another subject .
i should like it to be said to mr prodi personally , but as he is not here i say it to you so that you may pass it on .
i think mr prodi made a reference in ending his speech to de gasperi and to spinelli .
but in the last resort we are still in time to remedy it .
allow me to finish by making one other point .
the enlargement negotiations are important , we support them , and we support the final communiqu&eacute; .
but the final communiqu&eacute; also approves enlargement provided that the intergovernmental conference produces positive results .
if it does not produce positive results , to make any kind of enlargement is madness .
mr president , from today we leave the italian presidency behind us .
we leave florence behind us , with its non-decisions , or rather its decisions not to decide but to put everything off until dublin in october .
it is above all to minister dini that we look as the only representative of both the governments on either side of the italian elections which fell halfway through the presidency and had a strong effect on it .
from minister dini , currently responsible for foreign affairs , we call for continuity in the pursuit of the european aims that the italian presidency rightly set itself .
we therefore hand over with confidence to our irish friends the work schedule that will bring the citizens closer to the european institutions .
ireland will not have to concern itself with mad cows - also because irish meat is at least as good as italian - so it will have greater resources to commit to the construction of the common european home .
italy and its current government must perhaps live with the regret of having once again missed some opportunities , but these can be recovered to a certain extent through loyal cooperation with president santer and the next presidency .
mr president , there is something repetitive about our six-monthly debate .
we must succeed in making progress in the political handling of the issues of european integration .
the single currency requires a federal supranational power in the area of economic policy , because the problems of unemployment are just as important as those of monetary stability .
in short , we need a supranationality which we do not have in europe .
the governments do their bit but they all fail to move the process forward , and i fear the intergovernmental conference will one of the most disappointing , perhaps more disappointing than those which went before it .
maybe - and we ought to talk about this one day - there has been a mistake over the enlargement and the lack of adequate political conditions to make it feasible .
today , when it comes down to it , our vision remains economic and commercial , too limited for europe 's problems .
president prodi , how can one speak of this european integration as a human , political and intellectual enterprise ?
the speeches we hear on this subject underrate it .
when president prodi seems to confirm the gravity of this crisis , saying that unemployment puts european civilization at risk , he is making an important and telling statement .
but , mr president , what is that risk ?
does it arise from some kind of misfortune , some natural cause ?
how is it possible to speak positively of florence , in the face of virtually unanimous criticism from observers ?
how is it possible to do so in answer to statements like the ones you have heard here from mrs green and mr roth , which frankly strike me as undeniable .
so with dangers of recession looming and threatening a dramatic worsening in unemployment , there is not the slightest movement towards anti-cyclical economic policy . how can anyone fail to see that the problem is dramatic and unresolved ?
there is no anti-cyclical policy nor is there any room for innovation in the development model . there is not even any talk of reducing hours of work .
the problems of cohesion are now before us in unavoidable terms . there is consensus amongst the people of every single country , and it is one of alarm .
you yourself , president prodi , hear the largest union in your country talking about economic policy with alarm .
there is a need to change course , but we have not heard this option mentioned , even in today 's speeches .
mr president , a government like president prodi 's , standard bearer of general innovation , ought to have been able to drop the old tradition of optimism at the end of presidential terms .
in this parliament we are not satisfied with the outcome of the florence european council and with the term that has just ended in general .
secondly , in florence the italian presidency was presented by the intergovernmental conference with a proposal for reduced content and timetable , contrasting with the request for acceleration from the french and the germans .
it remains our hope that the italian government , free from the tinsel and the nightmare of the presidency , will now take on a driving role , finally involving public opinion as well .
president prodi , i would like a clear answer on this point .
mr president , while acknowledging the initiatives undertaken by the italian presidency , i am bound to say that i do not feel very optimistic .
quite simply , as far as the social area is concerned , florence has been a great disappointment .
we are told , as a basic reason for rejecting the confidence pact for employment , that the european union is not the best framework within which to combat unemployment effectively .
yet , at the same time , if the matter of employment is exclusively one for the member states , the figures show where that leads .
in my opinion , it is necessary to join forces effectively .
we are also told that the massive potential latent in the information society will enable much of the unemployment problem to be solved .
this is becoming the universal panacea .
but , ultimately , we know very well that that society will have no place for the union 's twenty million unemployed .
those from the textile industry , iron and steel , shipyards , the motor industry , building and public works and other industries will be considered beyond redemption .
in the battle that has been joined around the subject of globalization there will be winners and losers .
europe , today , is losing jobs ; tomorrow , perhaps , it will start losing its soul and its culture .
europe may swiftly slip into a dangerous form of decadence .
he could have said that here , now that the major projects recommended by the white paper have been buried .
europe does , however , hold some strong cards , and it can restore confidence in those who have lost it .
as far as employment is concerned , much remains to be done , and i believe there are at least three areas in which greater efforts must be made . first , technological innovation and research .
consequently , the programme must touch every sector of industry - the small- and medium-sized enterprises and industries , and very specifically those suffering from relocation .
secondly , industrial policy must under no circumstances be directed towards controlling decline - it must focus on a strategy of victory and employment .
within this framework , the structural funds must be allocated differently .
and , finally , the single currency must be harnessed to the service of employment and not to the service of the markets .
mr president , the council report and commission statement on the florence meeting and on the subject of employment and growth are simply not concrete enough .
announcements are not translated into action and , if you look carefully , no new decisions were taken on these questions .
so what remains is the council 's requests to the member states , and if you look at those in detail , you find that not all the proposals are likely to increase employment .
i need only think of the council 's call on the member states to implement the directives on the award of public contracts .
their implementation would not create new jobs but at most lead to a regional shift in the unemployment figures .
it was not even decided to make an adequate financial framework available for the third multi-annual programme for the smes .
so it is up to the individual national states to decide on measures , as you , mr president-in-office , also asked them to do .
but the council is the sum of the national states .
mr president , at this stage in the debate i am a little concerned that the italian presidency might think we are criticizing it unfairly .
we are not .
i think mr colajanni 's speech was very clear .
the italian presidency has made an enormous effort under very difficult conditions .
but i would say that it was the italian presidency 's turn in this case to ' get the dirty end of the stick ' .
that has meant that the italian government has had to concentrate on that problem , which is a real problem , but which has determined the outcome of the european council .
as a consequence the outcome of the european council of florence was unfortunately not satisfactory .
there is only one point on which the florence council has made progress , and that is the third pillar .
i congratulate the presidency of the council on that result , specifically on the european convention on extradition , which will make it possible to fight terrorism effectively .
and in a very similar field , we must also welcome the creation of the observatory on racism , which will be an important factor in fighting racism .
and if we do not emerge from this crisis then the european union , will not actually make any progress in the political sphere .
mr president , i want briefly to endorse a few of the comments made by the previous speaker , namely in relation to his assessment of the italian presidency of the council .
we have in the past certainly made a few critical comments on it in this house .
we are sometimes unjust in the way we divide up the presidencies of the council into six-month terms .
a council presidency can only be successful if it can build on past achievements during that presidency ; if it cannot build on past achievements , it is difficult for it to attain any goals .
i think that is also part of any real assessment .
i think one particularly good result of the florence summit is that it was decided there to politicize the intergovernmental conference .
there was always the danger that the intergovernmental conference would turn into a technocratic event .
under the chairmanship of president prodi it was decided to hold a special summit in dublin .
for that will create pressure to formulate proposals for these summits and i believe we cannot attach too much value to that .
what is important is that the intergovernmental conference will be politicized as a result of this decision .
in this connection i would also like to thank the commission and president santer .
there are some details , for instance in relation to article 129 ( c ) ( 1 ) and some other areas , such as article 103 ( 5 ) , where we still differ .
that can be discussed .
here the council must realise that it draws a distinction between executive tasks and legislative tasks in its own activities , so as to make this kind of cooperation with parliament possible .
i think the commission has submitted a sensible proposal here , on the basis of which we can hold sensible talks over the coming months .
one statement you made here , president santer , is of crucial importance . co-decision must be the rule !
then we can talk about a few exceptions , and we did not want to take the case-by-case approach , which some member state governments have unfortunately sometimes brought into play in recent times .
let me say something on other subjects raised at the summit .
agreements are not just designed to regulate periods of fine weather ; we need them in order to be able to act in times of difficulty and if someone is not being constructive .
for that reason the uk government with its bse crisis was extremely helpful in terms of the success of the intergovernmental conference , and we should build on that accordingly .
i also think that we should clearly establish the real orders of magnitude .
i would have been very pleased to see president santer 's proposals on the ten adopted at the summit .
but at the same time we in the european parliament should not give the impression that this would also resolve the problem of 20 million unemployed people .
the ten are important infrastructure measures which will in the medium and long term create greater competitiveness thanks to the improved infrastructure .
they only have limited effects on the labour market .
we must also realise that 97-98 % of appropriations for the ten have to be made available at national level .
we should now concentrate on removing the planning obstacles and making the budgetary resources available at national level .
and then let us ensure that another scandal like the bse one does not take away the resources we need to provide the necessary european share .
but we should not pretend that the ecu 1 billion mean that the ten cannot be created .
it is now up to the member states to do their homework so that the european union can make the necessary contribution to this .
nor should we let it be said that we are to blame for the fact that unemployment has risen so much so long as the powers in this area lie with the member states .
mr president , first i should like to express my thanks and appreciation to the presidentin-office of the italian presidency at a most difficult time , in fact at a time of european union institutional crisis .
it is important to state that the establishment of a european budget for the construction of these networks must not be at the expense either of the structural funds or of the common agricultural policy .
the structural funds have proven to be a successful vehicle for generating economic growth in the less well-off regions of the union .
finally , florence will be remembered for the successful efforts of the commission president and the italian presidency in persuading the united kingdom to lift its veto on the union 's institutional democratic decisionmaking process .
it will also be remembered for the acceptance of europol as a major weapon in our determination to cooperate to fight organized crime and we all welcome the european extradition convention .
fortunately , on some issues like europol and the convention on crossing frontiers , there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel .
florence confirmed 1 january 1999 as the date for economic and monetary union , as laid down in the treaty and already confirmed in madrid .
it would be unfair to blame the italian presidency alone for the dearth , when in fact it bears witness to a structural defect in this european union .
we hope the time will come when we can free ourselves from much of the ambiguity and ill will of the many who exploit europe and do nothing to build it .
mr president , despite the efforts of mr prodi and mr santer , yet another summit conference has led to intense disquiet and indignation on the part of working people .
yet again , we have had a surfeit of proclamations and wishful thinking about unemployment .
a surfeit , i would say , of hypocrisy .
essentially , every specific measure to deal with the problem was rejected .
not a single ecu was set aside for that purpose , the policy of frugality prevailed , and the labour and social rights of working people were overturned completely .
amid a persistence of conflicting statements , a political compromise was reached regarding ' mad cows ' , which provocatively ignores the need to protect citizens ' health on the basis of scientific criteria .
mr president , the summit conference reiterated the aim of strengthening relations with turkey .
it seems to draw no conclusions from turkey 's aggressiveness , which intensified greatly after the approval of customs union .
the continual provocations in the aegean and the continual disputing of greece 's territorial integrity demonstrate the kind of community solidarity guaranteed by the common external policy , and its imminent institutionalization by the intergovernmental conference .
i think that concern is justified , mr president , and should preoccupy the european union 's bodies .
on the contrary , it is likely to displease the farmers and breeders who have been seriously harmed by the effects of the crisis on public opinion , especially in terms of consumption .
mr president , one positive feature about the florence summit was that for the first time slovenia was able to participate alongside other countries belonging to the & # x02bc ; europe agreement ' .
as we know the association agreement between slovenia and the eu was signed on 10 june , having been through many stages .
slovenia can now start to catch up politically with the other central and eastern european countries in relation to the eu .
all in all however the summit produced fairly meagre results .
it was of course welcome that the dispute between the eu and great britain concerning mad cow disease was resolved .
however it is worth mentioning that despite the importance of the issue the dispute grew all out of proportion .
i believe that the issue on whether to increase the number of decisions to be taken by a qualified majority vote will have gained much support as a result of the british government vetoing many important decisions .
the new tacis regulation , which was difficult enough to produce , was one of the victims of british policy .
fortunately it was accepted by the agricultural council last week , and is now at last coming into effect .
at a time when we are awaiting the results of the russian presidential election , it is worth emphasizing the importance of developing co-operation with russia .
it is worth keeping in mind that stability is best achieved by establishing a variety of financial , cultural and political ties .
an atmosphere of suspicion and a dangerous policy based on that suspicion can be prevented only by increasing mutual understanding and mutual interests .
the tacis programme is an important instrument in this process .
the florence summit was a disappointment for european citizens expecting firm decisions on reducing unemployment .
we all know that there is no single means of improving the employment situation , but that it requires many different kinds of initiatives .
but leaders making official statements consisting of mere words leads to frustration and cynicism understandable under the present circumstances .
this growing frustration will become a real obstacle to building a common europe and reducing unemployment .
mr president , the romans said concordia parv&aelig; res crescunt , union is strength .
the corollary of that is that lack of unity leads to weakness and that is what mr prodi and the whole italian government had to contend with .
the union had fallen into complete impotence through lack of unity .
so it would not be surprising if any success in solving that matter , in bringing about a certain unity , were to warrant congratulation rather than the scoldings i have heard here .
so as far as that is concerned i should like to congratulate the italian presidency .
a second point which has rather surprised me is what mrs green has said .
she said she was greatly disappointed .
that takes a bit of reconciling , i think .
now for employment .
the question of employment has not been well solved .
i think we are all agreed about that .
i am glad that mr santer has found some positive points but no good solution has been found for it .
what is the reason ?
i think we are to some extent fooling one another with big ideas in which we call all sorts of meetings thinking that that can solve the employment problem .
everyone must cooperate and then it will be solved !
we must admit that at union level relatively little can be done , at national level rather more and at local level perhaps more still .
that does not mean that we cannot make an important contribution .
i am also very glad that the commission is going about that in various ways , above all by bringing the social partners together in such a positive way .
we must keep that in view - and that is also the objective of the european people 's party .
we know that in the present european budget there is not enough money to finance such an ambitious programme as the tens .
i am not saying that the tens are not important .
i think they are very important , but if we want to set them up we must somehow or other fresh money , whether by loans or by means of special taxation .
we have suggested a road tax or something similar , but we cannot get it from the present category 3 .
my great fear was that that would happen , that we should say there is not actually enough money there , but let us look in the present category 3 .
i am glad that danger is averted .
i am also glad that there has been some extension , though not a genuine one , in category 3 , but it is not enough and we must not delude ourselves that it is .
the one big danger is , i think , that this might be regarded as a solution .
it is not - not yet - we must press on and i wish the commission and the council and us ourselves all success in order to bring that about .
various points that arose at the florence summit have yet to be resolved , as indeed mr santer said .
i would like to stress two of them .
first , the matter of implementation of the meda programme .
as our president , jacques chirac , recalled , france was an originator of a united , stable mediterranean .
we are not , of course , unaware of the difference between greece and turkey . a difference , incidently , which is leading greece to block the meda programme .
but let us make no mistake about it , this obstructiveness is penalizing all the states of the union , and in particular those who have no connection whatever with the dispute .
it is a matter of urgency , therefore , to find a solution to the problem .
finally , we can only congratulate the council on instituting the third phase of european monetary union , for which we should all be grateful to it .
mr president , i represent half a million citizens in the southwest of england .
rarely have we followed a european council meeting with such interest as we did the florence summit .
i must congratulate the summiteers on the agreement on bse .
we are not yet out of the mire but the eradication plan agreed in florence is , nonetheless , a cause of relief for the cattle heartland of great britain .
however , i deeply regret the abject failure of european leaders to agree action to create jobs .
it is important to sort out the structural problems in our economies but this will take time .
it is no less important to act now to gain the benefits identified in the cecchini and delors reports of creating jobs through the dynamics of european economic integration .
this week has seen some 1 , 400 jobs lost in the footwear industry in england to low-cost producers overseas .
on top of the bse crisis , the mood in my constituency is one of near despair and this pattern is being repeated in rural areas across europe .
president santer described the challenge of unemployment as a question of the credibility of the council itself .
it is more than that .
it is becoming a question of public confidence in democracy in western europe .
when the european finance ministers meet next week , we need action on jobs .
they flunked it in florence , they cannot afford to flunk it again .
mr president , president santer , survivors of the italian government , the florence summit is very much a symbol .
in a nutshell , florence means machiavelli , and the rule of deceit .
the deceit of the cecchini report , which promised us five million jobs and gave us twenty-five million unemployed .
the deceit , too , of the handling of mad cow disease .
but florence also stands for the medicis , for poison .
the poison of the contaminated feeds .
and it also stands for lorenzo the magnificent or rather , in the present case , europe the malevolent .
malevolent towards employment .
all right , so you devote four pages out of eleven in your conclusions to the problem of employment .
you drone away about employment , growth and competitiveness , but you do not do anything .
all you do is tell us that you are looking for trails , as if a european summit was a jamboree of boy scouts practising stalking .
well , unemployment has nothing to do with trails .
what it has to do with is causes , and the causes are a tragic set of four errors .
first , an error concerning immigration , but all you can think about is xenophobia and racism , so i shall say nothing about it .
an error on free trade , the free movement of animals feeds - how many jobs has that done away with in the cattle sector ?
thousands of jobs .
an error with excess taxation .
for example , medicinal products in france were taxed at 2.1 % , and you have forced us to tax them at 5.5 % .
how many laboratories are you going to destroy ?
when spouses are taxed in france but not in ireland , when the estate duty allowance is 300 , 000 francs in france but 1 , 300 , 000 thousand in germany , then there is a problem .
all this needs to be equalized by allowing a free choice as to which method of taxation bears the lowest burden .
and the other error , president santer , concerns your budgetary policy .
article 104c of the maastricht treaty is a greek tragedy .
the more mr aznar and mr jupp&eacute; and mr dehaene struggle to fill the hole , the deeper and wider they make it .
it is a greek tragedy .
europe the malevolent , too , as regards monetary policy .
you told us that the single currency would provide a solution to the problems of competitive devaluation .
yes , but italy and spain will not be participating , and those are the countries responsible for competitive devaluations .
finally , europe the malevolent as regards agriculture and this whole mad cow business .
back in 1990 , in this very house , i denounced contamination of feeds .
as for you , your word was ' solidarity ' .
no , i am wrong , not solidarity , ' responsibility ' .
the criminal responsibility of the de mulder brothers , in doncaster , in yorkshire , who manufactured the contaminated feeds .
the criminal responsibility of the glon company , in france , which imported them .
the political responsibility of you yourselves , as the commission .
i am well aware that it was the sainted delors , that the sainted delors knew , and he let them get on with it , with the contamination , with the poisoning .
the philosophical responsibility lies with the inherent logic of the european commission which , by allowing free movement , demolishes customs barriers and , at the same time , allows the barriers between species to be breached .
one word of good news , mr president , and i shall leave it at that .
you have set up an observatory to study racism and xenophobia .
incidentally , you seem to have forgotten antisemitism .
i hope this observatory will be able to find employment for the twenty million unemployed .
then , for once , you will have done something useful .
in this context , as an austrian social democrat i absolutely cannot endorse some of the euphemistic words we have heard here about the florence summit .
on the one hand it was certainly a success for the presidency to have got this whole question of british bse out of the way , and that was certainly not easy .
in that respect the rapid and solidary decision taken by the summit , namely to lend a hand to the farmers harmed by bse by giving an extra ecu 200 m , was right and welcome .
on the other hand this florence summit was a pitiful failure in terms of employment policy and combatting unemployment in the eu .
this failure is all the worse because tackling this problem is increasingly becoming the acid test of european integration .
what is the point of all the important decisions on stronger methods of combatting crime if we are not able to offer millions of young people in this european union jobs and prospects for the future ?
a few years ago this european union and its governments solemnly set themselves the aim of halving unemployment by the end of this decade .
i heard nothing about that in florence .
just think of the normal budgetary procedure .
people have been referring here to a confidence-building agreement .
these statements have to be reflected in the annual budgetary procedures , mr santer !
mr president , at this stage of the debate there is little point in trying to be tough and original at the same time .
there are some on the other hand who simply resort to provocation and who say almost anything .
in the people 's party we are not ' euro-archangels ' , nor are we euro-fanatics and of course we should never regard europe as evil .
mr president , it is impossible to be original at this time .
liberty and security , mr president .
progress was made in florence .
and i must say with satisfaction that the irish presidency has taken up this banner .
but there is much work to be done .
there is also need of uniformity , more active community cooperation , in both the judicial and the political fields until the union reaches maturity .
we also echo the conclusions of the european council of florence with regard to the unsuitability of the third pillar instruments , in particular the common position and the agreements .
it is hard to make the citizens enthusiastic about abstract ideas and unspecific future possibilities .
to conclude , mr president , an appreciation of the common legal heritage must take precedence over technical and formal considerations .
security , mr president is no doubt the other essential dimension of necessity .
and to combine the security and the liberty of the european citizen is the challenge of the third pillar .
mr president , i wish to compliment those who are still here after this long debate , in particular mr dini and mr santer .
it is good to see that even although there is practically an empty chamber they are still listening and taking note .
i wish to pay tribute to the italian presidency .
i would single out in particular the successful asem summit in bangkok . this was preceded by the ngo conference at which i had the honour to represent parliament .
also very significant was the appointment of the special envoy to the great lakes area .
however , the success of last week 's summit in florence will be judged by many of our constituents by what it achieved for them .
they will look at unemployment - and i know everyone has been talking about it .
was there any progress made ?
i have to disagree with mr santer .
i do not think there was .
the finance ministers have merely been asked to draw up another report on ways of adjusting the tax system .
it is three years since the delors white paper and still all we have are words and not deeds .
there is no point in mr santer telling us that florence supported the confidence pact .
we need now to see some action .
it is true that agreement was reached on an increase in the financing of the trans-european networks but it is very disappointing for many of us that the money must be found from existing resources .
this will cause delays for many badly-needed projects throughout the european union and in my country , ireland .
i welcome the compromise agreement on the europol convention which , together with the extradition convention , i hope will be implemented as quickly as possible by all member states .
organized crime is emerging as one of the major problems in many countries .
only last week , as has already been mentioned , we saw the horrific murder of one of ireland 's foremost investigative journalists , veronica guerin .
she was killed because of her expos&eacute;s of the drugs underworld and all of us in ireland were very shocked by this callous act .
in the twenty-five dark years of violence in northern ireland i would remind you that there was never an assault on , or the murder of , a journalist .
this is a new low and i am sure i speak for all members in condemning this atrocity .
the journalist 's murder was followed yesterday by the intimidation of a dublin member of parliament who had also condemned the drug barons .
it is absolutely essential that the measures we discussed on money laundering and related issues are harmonized and that we bring europe 's laws up to date .
i repeat the call that the godfathers must not be allowed to remain outside european laws .
mr president , mr dini and mr santer , as trustee for the common good the current presidency of the union can formulate initiatives but as captain it cannot be better than the team as a whole .
that shows that the awareness of trusteeship can be a mobilizing force .
i would like to compliment you today , president dini , and thank you in particular for the italian ministers of energy who have energetically brought the single market a good step forward .
it is still incomplete in four areas , namely internal controls , fiscal matters , monetary affairs and the energy market .
there we have neither a single market nor a uniform situation , and considerable progress was made there .
consumer rights may have been enshrined in the treaties for 39 years , but have also been disregarded for 39 years .
for eight years we have been discussing how they can be translated into money and in the run-up to the florence summit the energy ministers made considerable progress .
the degree of market openness in the individual european markets will be the same .
no-one is prevented from being more open .
that will make them sure that this openness will not be abused unilaterally by an escape clause .
it is also important to know that services of general economic interest can be provided and that distributors are also involved in the competition to the extent that their customers are involved .
overall , the consumers are acquiring more rights , which is something we must also tell the citizens as consumers .
the fifteen individual markets can grow closer together and i agree with you , mr dini , when you said the union is becoming more competitive .
seen in those terms , 1 january 1999 will be doubly important .
mr president , i value the tenacity of mr president santer , but there is one problem - that of credibility .
his perception is too far removed from that of the european parliament and , if i heard him aright , from mr prodi 's too where employment is concerned .
i understand what mr santer is doing .
he seizes every positive point because that in itself is a step out of our present situation .
in itself i am ready to support that .
but if that optimism is too far removed from what we all see and what newspaper readers also see , then there is a credibility gap which in my view is already much too big in europe .
in my opinion we have not so far had any concrete decisions giving any ' body ' for example to mr santer 's confidence pact .
i shall not go into detail on the two points but the tens and support for medium- and smallscale businesses were important parts of that proposal .
every analysis emphasizes the importance of the confidence which employers must have in investors in the european economy .
there is now an urgent need for concrete decisions , for concrete signs that europe 's leaders themselves have confidence in that market .
that confidence can be created only if we stop selling indecision as resolution , and seek out the sensitive areas ; i think that is also a task for the commission .
mr president , first of all i too will thank the italian presidency for its effective way of working and the final result .
congratulations !
i regret , however , that the presidency 's summit council rejected president santer 's proposal to increase structural fund appropriations for the trans-european networks .
how are we to fight unemployment and how are europe 's economies to recover ?
frugality policies and financial measures alone will not suffice .
finally , a few words about the meda regulation .
mr president , why is the council of ministers not accepting the european parliament 's amendment proposing that from now on the meda regulation should include division of the funds among the mediterranean countries ?
mr president , mr president-in-office , i believe it is right to stress the fact that the future of the european project is in deep crisis , irrespective of the events that affect individual presidencies .
the truth is we need to recover a strategy , we need to recover an overall objective , which must revolve again around the question : what sort of europe do we want ?
and as italy is still in the european troika , i think we can make an important contribution to finding the answer to this question .
institutional issues are at the centre of this question so i want to touch very briefly on the point mr sarlis mentioned just now .
we have asked for simplification of the procedures for extending codecision , but we know that even under the current treaty it is very difficult to implement this crucial process for european democracy effectively .
there is exceptional resistance in the council .
it has been pointed out that the florence council changed an essential decision which had been made on the trans-european projects .
i wonder if the european parliament is in a position to be able to approve that compromise , because there is no doubt it creates a great problem .
then there is the matter of strong resistance to majority voting .
someone said we ought to thank the united kingdom because it has forced us to understand the absolute need to go beyond unanimity .
well , mr president , we must fight for a new identity .
the issue is this , the answer is this : political union and supranationality .
that is the line we must take . otherwise the original great project for europe is bound to enter its final crisis .
the results - as others have mentioned before me - have been europol , agreement on the convention on extradition , agreement on the protocol on corruption and the drive towards action on racism .
these seem to me to be very important points .
we are witnessing a contradiction as regards community fraud ; we have been in retreat for the last few years . whenever there is a footbridge we go the other way .
but at the intergovernmental conference we must insist on full community powers in the matter , because conventions do not work well enough .
mr president , i wish to echo the disappointment expressed by pauline green when she responded on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists at the beginning of this debate .
i want to look simply at budgetary matters .
in the conclusions from the presidency , under the comments on job creation and competitiveness , all it says is that the council will take note of the commission 's proposals on the budgetary issues .
it is a pity that it could not have been far more explicit in that statement .
in fact , the proposals from president santer were a mere shadow of what the commission had originally envisaged because the commission knew what was achievable .
even now i am not too sure that the commission will even achieve those limited aspirations in the light of what the council is saying .
my concerns are for the trans-european networks regardless of what is said in here .
my concern is for the promised money for the research budget of which there is no mention here .
my concern is for the incentives for small and medium enterprises to which there is only a passing reference in this document .
my concern also is that the council only says it will consider these proposals .
it is a pity it was not far more explicit and it is a pity it could not give us a lot more explanation .
for example it talks about raising a commitment ceiling in category 3 but the payments will be settled within the current limits of the overall ceiling .
what does that mean ?
i am sure the commission knows but does the council ?
if it does know then a mere simpleton like me would love to know what it means by that .
the proposal to find the extra ecu 200 , 000 within category 3 by ' redeploying available appropriations ' .
what does that mean ?
there are no incentives for the job creation proposals which the commission and parliament really wanted .
of course what it should have said is that it does not intend putting any further money into the european union budget and , in fact , wants money back .
but that would not fit into the niceties of the diplomatic language used in these conclusions .
mr president , i should like to start by echoing some of the concerns of my colleague , mr wynn , at the paucity of solid measures being introduced to deal with unemployment .
aerospace and educational software and multimedia are the key industries and key technologies for the next century .
most people 's prosperity will be based on one of those two industries . firstly because of the growth in air transport and secondly because of the development of the information society .
mr president , this parliament has always been concerned about the democratic deficit in the community 's decision-making process and the defence of proper rights of representation .
but today our reformist horizon has broadened and especially includes overcoming the institutional deficit which penalizes certain community policies as compared with others .
the main achievement of the six months just ended has been to narrow this institutional gap , seeking a new internal balance between union policies .
europe is no longer the monetarist monoculture it was six months ago , and that is an undeniable result .
in rome , at the tripartite conference with the social partners , and in florence , the first institutional elements of a community employment policy were outlined .
this institutional torsion has begun . it is now a case of concentrating the effort on consolidating this institutional process for employment and other citizenship policies , while the mechanisms of monetary unification move onward .
not being able to see all the elements of an actual process is a political sin as great as prejudice .
i want to make it clear here and now that the florence council was capable of producing various positive decisions such as those already mentioned in respect of the third pillar .
i regret , however , that the council was unable to give a response to the main question concerning our people , namely the fight against unemployment .
i regret that the council should have turned down the means for relaunching growth and employment .
i would still like to back calls for making available the necessary resources to finance the commission 's proposals .
mr president , i am rapporteur for the trans-european transport networks and i would like to offer my thanks and respect to the italian presidency in this connection for the efforts it made in the conciliation procedure .
in particular i would like to thank the transport minister , mr burlando , and commissioner kinnock for enabling us to achieve a result , to reach a compromise in this procedure .
four days before florence we had this compromise .
it also covers the fourteen essen projects , which we included in a list .
so we were all the more surprised to read in the florence conclusions that the european council notes that two member states want to make changes to an important project on this list .
so may i ask once again for a very precise answer , because many members of parliament , and i too , regard your answer to this question as highly important .
madam president , honourable members have expressed contrasting opinions about what the commission and the presidency have been able to achieve in the first six months of this year .
your opinions and assessments will be a stimulus to the work of the commission and the council in the next six months and in the future .
but i want to emphasize very firmly that there was no lack of drive and determination to achieve the presidency 's programme and deal with the main issues the commission has been pursuing .
but european council decisions require the consent of the governments of the member states .
everything possible was done .
i agree with what mr pronk said on this , and full account must of course be taken of the views expressed in this chamber today .
let me say to mrs green and the other members that it is not true that the conciliation agreement with the european parliament on the infrastructure projects was unilaterally changed at florence .
the european council just took note of a request for an amendment to that agreement presented by spain and portugal .
any change would in any case naturally require another codecision with the european parliament .
to mr ripa di meana i confirm the commitment already made by minister agnelli that the results of the intergovernmental conference will be approved by the italian parliament only if the european parliament gives its assent .
thank you very much , mr dini .
( the sitting was suspended at 7.45 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
transitional periods in accession treaties
the next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the commission :
madam president , finland , sweden and austria were given the right to maintain certain more stringent environmental standards during a four-year period .
during the transitional period the purpose was to re-assess the union 's corresponding regulations , so that the new member states do not have to lower the level of their standards by early 1999 .
we are half way through the transitional period and nothing worth mentioning has happened .
the environmental commissioner stated when she took over that one of the most important objectives during her term in office was to re-assess these regulations .
we have reason to believe that the commission will merely achieve a poor compromise , whereas this would be a perfect opportunity to raise the standard of environmental and health protection in the entire union .
by the beginning of april next year the commission and the council will give a detailed report on the progress of this matter .
madam president , the first time i spoke in this parliament at the beginning of january 1995 i put a question to the commissioner .
i wanted to know at what point the higher environmental standards of the three new member states , austria , finland and sweden , which were to be examined in the union , would be assessed .
at the time you replied that you regard it as one of your important tasks to raise the member states ' environmental standards .
the new member states were not to lower their standards but instead the community standards were to be improved with the accession of the new member states .
we therefore urge that a plan be presented showing how , by which measures and according to what timescales these adjustments can be achieved .
various proposals that have already been put before parliament , such as the directives on fuel qualities and on motor vehicle emissions , could in fact already contain elements of these higher environmental standards .
i ask myself why this is not yet the case .
therefore , commissioner , i hope that you can answer the questions we are putting to you today as positively as you did at the time , in january 1995 , when you came into office .
i also hope it will prove possible by the end of this decade to raise the environmental standards in the european union to a level that will greatly benefit the people and the environment .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , agreements are reached through agreement and the promises made in agreements should be kept .
particularly with regard to the horizontal approach to environmental law , it is important to note that we said ' yes ' by an overwhelming majority before our accession .
two thirds of austrians expressed themselves in favour of the european union , some 500 days ago , and the austrian people put a great deal of trust in the union .
it is now up to the union not to disappoint the trust put in it .
we will be holding elections on 13 october and they will be another measure of whether there is as much efficiency at european level as imagined .
in particular this involves updating the existing legislative texts on the classification , packaging and labelling of dangerous substances , on pest control and pesticides , on batteries and on the lead content of petrol .
for that reason we place great expectations in the commission 's proposals and call on it resolutely to fulfil its obligations as set out in the act of accession .
both i and the citizens of the european union find it hard to understand the slowness of its work process so far .
the single market can only work if there are uniform standards .
so it should be in the interest of us all jointly to aim at setting high-level environmental standards and thereby to counter the threat of the internal market principle being watered down by divergent standards .
as a representative of the business world in the european parliament i lay the utmost value on ensuring that the higher environmental standards apply throughout the european community .
madam president , madam commissioner , the citizens of the european union member states expect firm evidence that the european union really is working in the interest of their safety and their future .
in this respect it is particularly important to tackle efficiently the question on how cross-border environmental problems are tackled at eu level .
citizens of new member states cannot be expected to accept that the union would force their countries to lower the standard of environmental legislation .
on the contrary we feel that it is reasonable to expect that with joint efforts we can achieve progress on environmental policy within the european union .
improving the state of the environment should be one of the most important objectives in achieving binding international co-operation .
we have trusted the commission to fulfil its promises to develop community legislation during the four-year transitional period so that it is in harmony with the more stringent environmental standards of the new member states .
now the time has come to know what the commission 's measures and plans are and what the timescale is for fulfilling these promises .
what efforts will the commissioner make to bring forward legislation in accordance with both the general agreement and the fifth programme of action on the environment ?
what is the commission 's view on revising article 104 so that the member states besides keeping their own higher environmental standards can also introduce new regulations for improving the state of the environment ?
i would like to emphasize that we are talking about an important principle for the credibility of the entire eu , and we also require information on the fate of the transitional regulations given to new member states .
individual exceptions agreed upon with the new member states are important in themselves .
finland for example wishes to assert its right to maintain a lower level of cadmium in fertilizers , because cadmium is a so-called accumulative substance , which does not degrade but accumulates , thereby increasing the level of risk .
similarly it is essential to restrict the content of sulphur in liquid fuels in order to prevent acid rain .
madam president , in the negotiations leading to eu membership , sweden , austria and finland were given a four-year transitional period for parts of their environmental legislation .
at the same time the eu promised to revise their own regulations .
in sweden this agreement with the eu was publicly proclaimed as a guarantee that sweden would not have to lower its environmental standards .
since then little progress has been made .
we still lack a firm timescale as to how the eu will achieve these objectives .
we will be greatly disappointed if the union does not succeed in raising the level of its environmental standards as promised or perhaps even obliges the new member states to lower their environmental standards .
this would serve to swell the enormous criticism of the eu voiced by the majority of the swedes today .
for this reason i would like to present four pertinent questions to commissioner bjerregaard .
1.this question is about the legislation on chemicals .
when will the commission put forward this proposal ?
2.timescales are required for risk assessment and amendment of the directive on the restriction of harmful substances .
the swedish regulations on cadmium , tin-organic compounds , arsenic and pentachlorophenol are valid .
when will the commission specify how this work will be carried out ?
3.what initiatives does the commission intend to take regarding cadmium in commercial fertilizers ?
the complexity of these problems show how absurd the eu priorities are regarding the regulatory framework , where free movement of goods is given priority over environmental considerations .
the commission fully accepts its obligations to review the relevant provisions of community law which do not apply to the three new member states during a four-year period .
the review will , where necessary , be aimed at raising the existing community standards in the areas concerned .
for example , the commission 's ability to achieve the right result often depends on the information we receive from the member states , such as on the classification of a dangerous substance in the country in question .
at this meeting , there was a discussion of the progress achieved , the problems which had arisen , the future strategy and the timetable for the review process .
it is my hope and belief that this meeting and others of the same kind which are due to take place regularly in the future will provide a sound basis for continuing the review process .
this cooperation is important to achieve the political goal of high environmental and health standards , since the commission , as i said , is also dependent on information from the new member states .
where the directives in question are under review , the commission is endeavouring to take the new member states ' legitimate interests into account .
i should now like to describe what is happening or has happened with a number of directives covered by the review clause which contain aspects relating to health and the environment .
these have been referred to by several speakers .
it should perhaps be pointed out that the directives are administered by different services and therefore fall under the responsibility of different commissioners .
firstly , there is directive 67 / 548 on dangerous substances .
the results of these meetings will be adopted as adjustments to technical progress under the committee procedure which is laid down in the directive .
if the new member states can supply the necessary scientific data in time , the prospects are good for concluding the process before the end of 1998 .
both the commission and sweden will play an active role in this process , to ensure that an acceptable outcome is achieved before the expiry of the transitional period .
austria is to submit a study of the effects of the country 's additional labelling requirements on the attitudes of consumers .
further discussions will take place on the basis of this study and austria 's proposals for measures in case of accidents .
then there is directive 88 / 379 on dangerous preparations .
the problems with the classification , packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations are closely related to those arising in the case of the directive i have just dealt with .
the solution for dangerous preparations will therefore broadly follow the approach outlined in that context .
with regard to preparations which are not dangerous , it is proposed to solve the problems in the planned review of directive 88 / 739 .
the adoption of a commission proposal for a new european parliament and council directive is scheduled for july 1996 .
we next come to directive 78 / 631 on pesticides .
this directive will be repealed .
the classification , packaging and labelling of pesticides will be included in the scope of the revised directive on dangerous preparations .
it is hoped that the proposal for a new european parliament and council directive will be adopted by the commission in july 1996 .
directive 91 / 414 deals with the marketing of plant protection products .
there is also directive 76 / 769 on limiting the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations .
the new member states have stricter legislation , as has been emphasized here today , on the marketing and use of pcps , cadmium , organic tin compounds and arsenic .
these risk assessments , which should be completed by early 1998 at the latest , will form the basis for the discussions in the relevant working groups , together with further technical and economic data .
the directive can be amended by a committee procedure .
the commission will begin specific studies after the summer holidays , and due account will be taken of the austrian studies of substitute products for pcps .
austria will also be presenting studies of the gradual phasing-out of the use of cadmium .
the last directive to which i shall refer is directive 76 / 116 on fertilizers .
this directive can be amended by a committee procedure .
i am sorry to have spoken at some length , madam president , but i felt it my duty to give parliament a thorough account of the situation .
it has to be stressed that there is little time .
a good 18 months have already gone by , and there are another two and a half years to go .
knowing how long it takes for legislation to go through the union machinery , there is every reason to be very pessimistic .
according to the commissioner a proposal for the amendment of the classification , packing and marking of pesticides should already have been put forward in july 1996 .
here we are now in july 1996 .
nor does the cadmium issue present a technical problem .
the technology required for solving the cadmium issue already exists .
in this connection it should be pointed out , as has already been done , that this is a major health issue in finland for example , where the environment is considerably more vulnerable than in some other areas .
the proposals concerning the sulphur content in fuels have for example not been included in the auto-oil programme , nor does the fifth programme of action regarding the environment meet requirements .
public opinion in the new member states is very concerned as to how the european union deals with environmental issues and particularly how the european union stands by the promises it gave when the accession treaty was signed .
before joining the union there was a referendum in each of the three countries , which was preceded by union supporters assuring the public that the european union would under no circumstances require a dilution of our present legislation .
the commissioner also mentioned in her speech that she is of the opinion that legislation in the new member states should definitely not be diluted .
but i would like to see realistic regulations in the form of a realistic schedule .
in this context it is also important to make sure that member states , both old and new , can maintain and create new , more stringent regulations on environmental issues , whenever this is required for environmental reasons .
for this purpose article 104a should be revised .
we should in other words make every effort to ensure that a more stringent legislation is feasible .
madam president , madam commissioner , colleagues ; during membership negotiations sweden was granted transitional regulations for a period of four years for sections of the environmental legislation .
the objective was that during this period the eu would catch up with our more stringent regulations .
naturally in the long-term we cannot grant exceptions and special regulations within the internal market and consequently create differences which affect the flow of goods and services as well as free competition .
the waterways , the sea and the air are ours in common and we have to work with the community to be able to create uniform regulations .
the union 's most important task is to achieve a viable environmental policy .
these serious , cross-border problems which we are encountering today cannot be resolved at a national level alone .
therefore it is of the utmost importance that we achieve results now .
we have been members of the union now for one and a half years .
according to the commissioner the work is on-going .
i would however like to have more details of the overall timescale and how co-operation between the various directorates is organized .
we have had positive experiences proving that there does not have to be conflict between industry and the environment , rather the contrary .
technology , products and limit values are already operating within the union .
we should take advantage of this and create the long-term environmental policy needed to achieve workable solutions in the future .
regarding the assessment , it was not quite clear whether this work has already begun or not .
the responsibility for organizing and structuring this work in fact lies with the commission .
i am convinced that none of the countries withhold essential information .
the assessment must be carried out immediately in order to give us a basis for decision-making and thus create credibility so that our regulations can be transferred up to union level by 1999 at the latest .
madam president , what the commissioner said was most interesting .
however , she did not give her position on the main question .
how does the commission interpret article 100a ( 4 ) ?
that is a relevant question for those who want to know whether austria , finland or sweden can retain their national provisions in the field of environmental protection and the working environment .
that means it should not be insinuated that in using the measures they want to apply these three countries are trying to bring about arbitrary discrimination and covertly to restrict trade .
that is not the purpose of these three new countries .
the aim of these three new countries is to maintain and further improve the high environmental standards in europe .
that is also the priority of the individual european citizen .
commissioner , article 69 of the treaty of accession states that specific provisions may be retained and will be reviewed by 1998 .
it also says that regardless of the results of that review , the acquis communautaire shall apply from the end of the transitional period .
that is the real snag .
i would like you to tell me how things are to go on if no agreement can be reached ?
is what was promised to us in 1994 still applicable if difficulties arise in european harmonization ?
those are relevant questions , which have remained unanswered .
we do not want specific rules but would hope that europe as a whole will go along with us and introduce the same rules that are already law in our three countries .
that is the subject today , not individual difficulties with cadmium , alkali-manganese batteries and so on .
in the auto-oil programme for example , accepted by the commission a couple of weeks ago , the permissible benzene content in petrol is set at two percent .
many member states at the present time permit a benzene content of just one percent .
if the commission wanted to show that it really is serious about tightening environmental standards to meet the level of the new member states , it should therefore have proposed a benzene content in petrol of one percent maximum .
this kind of example , of which there are several as we have heard here today , undermines the credibility of the commission 's role .
the commission should immediately draw up a plan showing how it intends to fulfil its promises .
madam president , having heard the commissioner 's reply , we should seriously ask ourselves what will happen at the beginning of 1999 if this re-assessment fails .
we might for example end up with a situation where , say , the french fertilizer industry appeals to the commission about the finnish cadmium restrictions .
and the community 's court of justice may finally decide that finland is preventing free competition and that finland should loosen its environmental legislation , the importance of which surely became clear to everybody in the previous discussion .
but madam commissioner , you did not answer the questions raised .
what is the commission 's viewpoint , and do you believe that the link between environmental protection and free trade will be tightened at the intergovernmental conference in favour of environmental protection ?
it is not very professional to go behind the backs of the council .
as a commissioner you have wide powers to take initiatives and you are very aware of it .
madam president , madam commissioner , merely to aim at solving the environmental problems we have is not sufficient .
nor is it sufficient to hope for a solution regarding austria 's , sweden 's and finland 's transitional regulations .
there must be a higher objective .
that objective must be to achieve firm proposals on how we should act in order not to have to lower our more stringent environmental standards .
that is really the only answer we want .
pious hopes are not enough .
that is why the commissioner 's replies are inadequate .
it is of course a positive development that there will be something in july regarding the directive on preparations .
but we would like to know what this something is .
nor is it enough that something will be done on cadmium in commercial fertilizers .
we would like to know what exactly is being done .
i do not think that we need further proof of what cadmium in commercial fertilizers does to nature .
there is already evidence of that all over europe .
we need to know what the commission is really planning to do .
the same applies to the schedule for directive 76 / 769 on the restriction of harmful substances .
it was said that it is not vital to specify the harmful substances which are of concern to us .
but i feel that this really is essential .
the commissioner talked about a detailed assessment of the risks .
but what more do we need to know about cadmium , tin-organic compounds , arsenic and pcb .
i do not think that we need any further proof of the consequences of using them .
i think that the environmental situation in europe is already proof enough of an existing problem and where the causes of this problem can be found .
in my opinion there are really only two solutions to this problem :
it is also a question of people 's confidence in the european union .
we have had our referenda .
we know that there will possibly be more referenda , and the environmental issue is critical in the public 's perception of the eu and its way of dealing with issues .
that is why we have to be more active on this issue than we have been hitherto .
madam president .
this really is a test case for the eu , since all the swedish environmental organizations prior to the referendum expressed criticism about swedish eu membership for environmental reasons .
the undertaking given by commissioner bjerregaard that no new member state should have to lower their standard involves considerable measures .
such a compromise is bound to lead to a lowering of standards in the new member states .
commissioner bjerregaard gave an extremely far-reaching undertaking .
it will be excellent if you can stand by this undertaking .
i would like to have this confirmed .
madam president , from some of the contributions here in the house , one might almost have the impression that i had not made my speech .
also , i declared what i myself am working for in political terms .
i think that everyone here in the house understands that no country was given guarantees in advance .
the prospect was held out to all the countries that we would seek to achieve as high a level as possible , and i have said that this is also my political aim and what i am working for .
clearly , many of these proposals are subject to a democratic process .
we have to abide by the rules as they stand .
in this way , we have ensured that we shall have the information we need to be able to make the necessary changes .
that is what i am working for , and i also believe that it is possible .
i understand that i have the support of parliament .
that is the task before us , and together we must do all we can to ensure that it is achieved .
thank you , commissioner .
i have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 40 ( 5 ) of the rules of procedure .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
legislative and administrative simplification
madam president , the molitor group did not produce a good report .
it was unbalanced , incomplete and biased .
in addition , the molitor group did not fulfil its terms of reference .
for administrative and legislative simplification to become a reality we must reject the concept of deregulation . that implies lower health and safety standards in the workplace , less consumer protection and lower environmental controls .
this is the sort of deregulation advanced by molitor .
in addition , the molitor group looked more to the needs of big business rather than smes who are the real job creators .
the commission and this parliament have moved on .
the better law-making and the slim , simpler legislation for the internal market initiatives are to be welcomed .
agreement can be reached on plans to simplify european union legislation , to better identify and consolidate related laws into single accessible texts .
in addition , progress must be made in ensuring that national civil services do not goldplate european legislation by making it more onerous than intended .
simplification of laws is a key to european competitiveness but it must be carried out with full public consultation and involvement and it must pay particular attention to the needs of smes .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , as the saying goes , there is no point shooting the pianist because the piano is out of tune .
there is agreement on the fact that the keyboard of european legislation has become too complicated as a result of frequently incomprehensible regulations and directives and is therefore meeting with less and less acceptance .
to stop the european process of integration for that reason would be like shooting the pianist .
we must tackle the evil at its source , we must set about improving and simplifying community legislation .
and that is also the way the commission saw it .
so it convened the group of independent experts chaired by bernhard molitor .
the result is the molitor report which we will discuss here today .
at this point i first want to give warm thanks to the draftsmen of the opinions for their cooperation .
the molitor report goes into various aspects .
as rapporteur of the committee responsible , i want to discuss six points .
first point : the molitor group concentrated its activities on the aspect of deregulation .
but deregulation of community standards is only one aspect of legislative simplification .
legislative simplification must mean first and foremost that community legislation is made accessible to the european citizen ; here precedence must be given to making it clear and readable .
codification is the simplest and most cost-effective form of legislative simplification and one that creates more trust among the citizens .
second point : one important proposal in the molitor report is that community legislative proposals must be based on the broadest possible dialogue .
but this must include a hearing of the circles concerned at every stage of the conceptual development of the legislative procedure , and certainly before the first draft legislation is prepared .
that will make sure that the legislation is more closely geared to practice and make it easier to assess the aspects of subsidiarity and proportionality .
third point : the report contains no objective analysis of the effects of community and national law on competitiveness and employment .
that would have been particularly important because the examination and evaluation of these links formed a specific part of the mandate the commission gave to the group .
fourth point : the molitor group has looked at community legislative proposals purely from economic viewpoints .
fifth point : the molitor group did not pay enough attention to the link between legislative simplification at community level and legislative simplification at member-state level .
legislative simplification at community level certainly does not automatically entail legislative simplification in the individual member states .
taking a gradual approach on the basis of a balanced check-list will help identify any tendency to over-regulate at an early stage and give the legislator adequate warning .
the molitor report does not contain such a check-list .
let me conclude with two basic considerations .
laws are not meant to deter but to encourage people to take initiatives , under the heading of fostering independence .
over-regulation is always an expression of fear and uncertainty , an expression of lack of trust .
that lack must be reduced and that trust regained , so that the concert is played in tune .
madam president , i would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for having kindly considered the views of the committee .
the report is a reaction to the molitor group 's proposal .
i will deal solely with the areas which are within the scope of the committee , issues on labour law and working environment and to some extent also issues of principle .
the molitor group 's proposal has been heavily criticized ; partly within the group where some of the members had dissentient views , partly by the commission and now also in the report from parliament .
let me give you some examples .
1.the molitor group states that a distinction should be made between simplification and deregulation .
but this distinction is not made later on in the report .
there is of course an essential distinction .
who could oppose laws being simplified as much as possible .
but this does not always mean deregulation .
we need regulation in order to achieve better health and safety for employees , but also to prevent social dumping.2.the molitor group assumes that deregulation supports growth and employment .
there is no such proven link .
japan , for example , has a high employment rate , high growth and a highly regulated labour market .
in the eighties new jobs were created in europe , but this was not the result of deregulation .
but with the extensive deregulation in europe in the nineties we lost jobs .
there is no link between deregulation and growth and higher employment.the molitor group was also given the task of examining national legislation .
this the molitor group has not done .
this makes the report more or less worthless .
regarding health , safety and labour law we have a very limited legislation at community level , but a very extensive legislation in individual countries .
it may even be that if we had more extensive legislation at community level , we would not need such an extensive legislation at the national level .
and this would make things simpler .
another problem the molitor group does not sufficiently deal with is implementation .
although , as i said earlier , we do not have very extensive legislation at community level , a major part of the legislation regarding health and safety has not been implemented in member states .
it is very contradictory to have even less legislation at community level , as the molitor group suggests , when existing legislation has not been sufficiently implemented .
instead we should demand that existing legislation is implemented .
article 171 should be used to enforce the implementation of existing legislation .
the molitor group has doubts about article 100a being criticised as it states that we should have minimum standards and that individual countries could keep their more stringent legislation and progress from there .
according to the molitor group article 100a is sufficient .
this is not the case .
article 100a regulates , and is the norm for the internal market .
article 118a on the other hand protects the individual .
in the report cost is weighed up against benefit - naturally .
but what cost ?
the short-term or the long-term cost ?
should we consider the cost of all injuries and deaths that occur in the workplace ?
in 1992 these accounted for 7 % of the social costs in the eu .
that amounts to approximately 27 , 000 , 000 , 000 ecu .
of course they should be considered .
as should the cost of the 8 , 000 deaths occurring in the workplace each year .
what is the cost for those 8 , 000 people ?
such aspects should naturally be weighed up and included in a cost-benefit analysis .
i will finish by saying something positive about the molitor report .
it proposes a number of fundamental social rights to the treaty - this we find very promising .
we take the view that high standards of protection can only be achieved by environmentally sound regulation and harmonization .
we reject the report 's assertion that past european environmental policy was inefficient and ineffective .
in fact , it has played a major role in cleaning up europe 's environment .
we deplore the lack of a firm statement in favour of environmental protection in the molitor group .
we remind the commission that parliament must consent to any repeal of legislation and that any repealed laws must be replaced .
this is as true for food policy as it is for environment policy .
we want simplification but we do not want deregulation .
some basic principles must be the guidelines for any action stemming from molitor .
first , current environmental standards and existing levels of consumer protection must not be lowered .
in fact , there is plenty of room for raising environmental standards in many areas as we have already been debating .
second , european union legislation must be clear , coherent and transparent .
third , it must be able to ensure uniform implementation and enforcement .
it is regrettable that there was no expert with environmental or food law experience on the molitor committee .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the results of the molitor report are disappointing .
it cannot be denied that many legal provisions are too complicated and inaccessible to the legal layman because they are incomprehensible .
that situation is extremely unsatisfactory , which is why means must be sought of remedying it .
as stated in mrs mosiek-urbahn 's report , clarity and readability , which make the legal standards more comprehensible , are an important factor of their public acceptance .
the attempt to simplify the standards is , however , often misused in political debates as a means of putting at risk achievements such as the protection of workers consumers and the environment .
the report by the working group asserts that there is a correlation between legislative simplification and increased growth and job creation .
it has not , however , favoured us with any proof that this assertion is correct .
no doubt it is particularly important and desirable to simplify legislation , and above all many procedures , for the small and medium-sized undertakings .
it would be a help to go through the provisions in many areas , such as building regulations , operating rules or permits .
but it would be dangerously deluded to believe that the situation in competition can be improved by social dumping , by dismantling worker and public health protection .
the notion that single market regulations should only be adopted in areas in which the single market has clear advantages is also to be rejected .
the question must be asked , advantages for whom , for here it is easy for businessmen to demonstrate that the single market has opened up many new opportunities and brought many advantages .
to conclude i would therefore say that we are certainly not against reform .
we members of parliament in particular , who have a special obligation towards our citizens , support legislative simplification .
we know that it is also to do with us if laws come into being that can only be understood by specialists and that the appeal for greater clarity and simplicity must also be addressed to us .
we also support the proposal to accelerate the codification of community legislation .
mrs mosiek-urbahn 's report also contains proposals on how these problems can be tackled .
but we will not accept any attack on the working consumer and the environment under the guise of simplification .
the epp group agrees with the report in all points and we do not doubt that tomorrow it will receive the assembly 's majority support .
after the rapporteur 's brilliant exposition there is little to add as regards the lights and shades of the molitor report .
we are speaking of rules , madam president , that is of legislative provisions .
but rules or provisions are enforceable and derive their capacity for social integration from the fact that they are the law .
either they are the law or they are nothing .
that is clear , madam president .
simplification , codification , the best technique of legal draftsmanship is therefore an urgent task which cannot be deferred .
but the law is not there to serve employment and competition or even the values which represent the cement of our civilization , since the law is the very incarnation of those values of society .
the molitor group made a fundamental mistake by resorting to casuistry and identifying themselves a little too much with the point of view of employers in general with the wishes of those who want the minimum legislation possible .
my positive conviction however is that quite a different approach should have been chosen by both the molitor group and parliament .
i hope that at least the commission will give some thought to my suggestion .
we are waiting hopefully for the results of the commission 's slim project so that , if they are positive , slim can also be applied to more projects .
but the commission ought to realize that not everyone , certainly in the agriculture sector , has problem-free access to the celex network .
the same difficulty applies , mutatis mutandis as far as the european parliament is concerned .
again and again when we get an amendment of an old directive we have to find out ourselves how that amendment fits into the old directive .
we cannot bring out any proper coherent legislation in that way .
i have already spoken once to the commission about it .
the commission has sent me an answer but we see very little result .
my group will therefore vote against some passages but support the report as a whole .
madam president , the report of the molitor group is on first impression a pessimistic one .
it leaves out fundamental questions and makes proposals which are worrying and which disappoint the hopes placed on the work of the molitor group .
on the one hand there are specific fields which the molitor group did not deal with and which affect citizens , such as legislation on the environment .
on the other hand there are others which have been dealt with where only economic criteria are paramount .
that is unacceptable .
the points drawn up by the rapporteur are very pertinent and so are her recommendations .
finally i should like to point out that the simplification and reduction of legislative texts must not lead to covert suppression of rights .
madam president , legislative and administrative provisions must be as clear and simple as possible , if only to provide the necessary clarity of standards , a basic requirement of all legislation .
given the actual state of our legislation , it is not surprising that the commission instructed a group of experts to work out proposals to simplify community legislation and administrative provisions .
at any rate , this general mandate enabled the group to continue working on the hypothesis that simplification is the same as deregulation .
parliament is only doing its duty in refusing to approve this concept and agreeing with the committees that ask it not to do so .
the best way to simplify legislation and administrative provisions is to have clear legal bases , but unfortunately in the cases concerned the only binding community legislation is in articles 130a to 130t .
for instance the social protocol is not a legal basis , but should become so as soon as possible , and parliament should not cease calling for that .
madam president , simplification can be a very complicated business .
the way in which the molitor group has tackled the problem , by effectively identifying simplification with deregulation , has done nothing to simplify the treatment of the problem of simplification .
because we can see the results , everyone says to us , ' hands off my acquis communautaire , hands off my legislation ' .
well , the problem today is to rediscover the majesty of the law .
because , in most cases , what is referred to as the shortfall of democracy is really nothing but a shortfall in legibility .
in this respect , the methods proposed by mrs mosiek-urbahn are entirely admirable .
i would like to add two comments .
my first relates to consultation .
my second comment - and this will be all i have to say madam president - is that this debate is inseparable from the debate on the hierarchy of standards .
in order for simplification to take place , there has to be a distinction between legislation and regulation .
the intergovernmental conference will have to concern itself with that .
this evening , we can thank mrs mosiek-urbahn for having posed the problems so skilfully .
madam president , my group is in favour of simplifying european legislation .
but we regard the molitor report only as a start .
european business circles have long been demanding an internal market , the market in which a large number of national laws are collected into uniform ec legislation .
but uniformity must be guaranteed .
member states and the commission together must ensure that the legislation is implemented correctly and on time .
and both must check how and whether this legislation is observed .
it upsets the basis of the state governed by the rule of law if we make laws which we then do not enforce .
along with a check on correct and prompt legislation i think we must beware of unnecessary complication of national legislation in transposition - a subject which molitor , wrongly , did not get round to at all .
so i should like to see a joint action programme by the commission and the member states to achieve an improvement in the quality of transposition at national level .
so complaints need to be taken seriously and the complaints procedure needs to have time-limits applied .
i would gladly have offered him a cake if he had been here to celebrate .
madam president , i should like to thank the rapporteur , mrs mosiek-urbahn , for her report , which will be able to play a part in the efforts we are making together to simplify legislative and administrative procedures .
simplifying the legislative and administrative procedures to which businesses are subject is an important part of the general strategy for growth , competitiveness and employment .
the commission felt that it was necessary to obtain the opinion of a group of independent experts in this area .
the commission 's position on the molitor group 's report is well known , since it has expressed its views on each of the proposals contained in the report .
the commission would also have liked to see the group do more in terms of analysing and assessing the impact of national legislation , as many speakers have also emphasized today .
like parliament , the commission therefore feels that supporting and encouraging simplification is not synonymous with deregulation .
here i am thinking in particular of the implementation of the internal market and maintaining a high degree of protection in terms of health , safety and environmental and consumer protection , as provided for in the treaty .
despite these reservations concerning the molitor report , it is a useful contribution to the debate on simplification - and i would stress that it is just one useful contribution .
it is of course up to the commission to take the necessary initiatives , just as in the final analysis it is up to the legislators to come to a decision on these initiatives .
the recent moves in this area by the community institutions , for example the slim project , show that the process is well under way .
you may be assured that the resolution which parliament will presumably adopt tomorrow on the basis of the mosiek-urbahn report will be a source of inspiration for the commission .
i put a very definite and direct question to the commission .
now it may be that mrs bjerregaard only reads the text she has received , but at least she can then agree to give us a written answer .
there was a request in the opening speeches for the questions that were asked to be answered in writing .
that will naturally be done .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
renewable energy
the next item is the report ( a4-0188 / 96 ) by mr mombaur , on behalf of the committee on research , technological development and energy , on a community action plan for renewable energy sources .
the action plan for renewable energy sources makes a considerable contribution to tackling both challenges .
it is concerned with creating a worldwide market for energy technology , which will grow because of the world-wide energy famine , and above all with solutions for nearly three billion regional inhabitants .
what we need is innovative techniques that combine the use of several renewable energy sources .
the union still occupies a leading position in the technology for using these energies .
do we want to miss out on developments here too , as we have already done in some areas ?
do we want to miss the opportunities ?
i and the committee on research , technological development and energy say we do not , and we must act quickly , otherwise the production will move away from europe .
jacques santer said : ' europe has no shortage of trump cards , and lacks only a strategy for playing them . '
jacques delors said : ' in terms of worldwide competition the community is suffering for its inadequate involvement in markets with a wealth of possibilities for the future . '
how true , how right they both are !
so , let us work out the strategy and carry it through .
the starting signal has sounded today .
the date of the debate , in early july 1996 , could not be more propitious .
the irish presidency has announced that developing renewable energies was a priority .
unesco will be holding the solar summit on the solar energy decade in september .
the conference on climate will be held in geneva in july .
in trieste , the eu and mediterranean countries ' energy ministers have just created a forum for renewable energy sources .
unfortunately i must remind you that early this year the commission made a very poor impression when allocating research funds for renewable energy sources .
it now has an opportunity to make up for that .
what is our strategy ?
anyone who believes renewable energy techniques could be applied worldwide on the basis of tax money is on the wrong track .
no , the only recipe for success is to impress the markets , that is to say , to aim at sustained demand and not just a temporary upsurge .
building on that , the producers of this technology must be allowed new stages of production , i.e. cost reductions .
it also means that the many policies of the individual directorates-general must at last be coordinated and made more open so that anyone can see what is actually happening there overall .
it also means stimulating the markets by having standards for marketable goods .
it also means increasing the budget appropriations for this research , for it is one of the most important research fields .
it also means that the union , represented by the commission , must cooperate more closely than in the past with the world bank .
our hearing brought some weaknesses to light .
i agree with mr spencer : the next hurricane should be named after an oil company .
what about calling it mobil ?
at member state level , information is necessary , as is the training of architects .
how do we really propose to promote this technology ?
if private clients turn to architects who have no idea about the technology , we will see no progress .
we need workers in the installation trades , we have to change the building regulations in the member states .
the measures i have listed make it clear that the european union cannot promote this development by itself .
we are a supranational community .
we need the participation of the member states , and there we are in a bad way in many respects .
why does greece have markedly better values than italy ?
why are there major differences between france and germany , indeed extreme differences in wind-power technology ?
why between denmark and ireland ?
all this is unexplained , all this indicates weaknesses .
it is clear that if one country blocks progress , that slows down all the others .
commissioner , it must therefore be decided what the union should do and what the member states should do .
general declarations are no use to us any more .
that is why it is of strategic importance .
commissioner , i am grateful for your presence at this late hour .
on behalf of the committee , and i hope also on behalf of the plenary , i call on you to waste no time !
make use of the strong support this house gives you .
forward the already agreed communication from the commission to the council and the european parliament without delay , so that today 's starting signal can immediately lead to successful developments .
madam president , i should first like to congratulate mr mombaur .
this is the traditional thing to do , but this evening i mean it completely .
i congratulate him for three things .
the european parliament has a long-standing commitment to renewable energy .
it has shown that in its resolutions but more practically it has shown it in enhancing the budget for those energies .
we have competitors who do not show that inertia .
the united states and japan are jumping into markets : huge contracts recently signed in china and india by american companies for photovoltaic arrays .
we do not even use the money that is available in the european union as well as we could .
we could be using the structural funds to have regional projects for renewable energy .
we could be using meda much more .
we could be using phare and tacis .
they are overwhelmingly being used on nuclear programmes when they are not always appropriate .
the council of ministers has shown time after time an attitude of obstructiveness and the saga of thermie ii is testimony to the way in which it has not seized the opportunity to enhance renewable power .
we need an equivalent of the euratom treaty for renewable energy .
it would be a good idea by the way if we did something in our new buildings to do with renewable energy .
as far as i can tell there is no plan to do anything at all and that is disgraceful .
does it matter ?
yes , it matters because we made promises at rio that we would meet commitments in cutting co2 and we have not met those promises .
we are not keeping them and we will not unless we change direction .
it matters because in some part of the world - in africa , india and china - people are leading diminished lives because they have no access to electricity .
there are no grids anywhere near them and only renewable energy can give them access to electricity and the sort of life we take for granted .
it matters because of the potential in our own european union and in the whole of central and eastern europe .
it matters because we are throwing away the possibility of jobs .
we say that our no 1 priority is the creation of jobs .
yet we do not take one measure in the form of renewable energy which would certainly provide jobs .
so , what do we have to do ?
first , the action plan in mr mombaur 's report .
i hope that colleagues will look at that very carefully .
it lists not only what should happen but who should do it .
we should follow up progress on that action plan at least every six months .
the european union has a budget it could use .
the commission could coordinate very much better than it does the actions of all the different directorates-general involved with renewable energy .
we could have a prize .
i would like to suggest that it be called the phoebus prize after the sun god .
our member states - and we have some influence there - should start removing some of those barriers .
i am delighted to say that the industry concerned with renewable energy has this evening taken the very sensible step of setting up the european renewable energy export council .
five different types of renewable energy have come together in one export council and that is an excellent step forward .
we need industry to go out and sell renewable energy .
i say to commissioner papoutsis that we know he has a strong and sincere commitment to renewable energy .
as mr mombaur has said , we look forward to working with him over the next years to ensure that something which should have happened long before at least happens now .
madam president , commissioner , i must start by saying that i entirely agree with what my distinguished friend mrs mcnally has said .
but when there is a political will these administrative problems can be solved , and so it was .
i should like to add two things .
first that at all times we have been aware that the commission supported us , of course , much more than most member states and the council itself .
sometimes such a document lacks interest or is a mere adjunct to the motion for a resolution .
but that is not the case here .
if we carry on using fossil fuels to produce energy , it is obvious that the emission of pollutant gases will also continue , with the well-known harmful effects on the climate .
that is why we back the report and congratulate mr mombaur , raising a few points which we think are important :
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , mr mombaur 's report contains a very realistic analysis of the possibilities and measures in the field of generation of renewable energy .
europe can do something with that .
the liberal group shares the vision presented here and thinks that in due course money should be made available to fund it .
but at council level at the moment an extraordinarily dirty game is being played .
time after time programmes which would necessarily lead to energy savings , lower co2 emissions and transfer of knowledge of energy technology within europe and elsewhere are being blocked by the council .
first it was thermie as long ago as 1994 and now we can add save ii .
it is striking that the council never makes cuts in nuclear energy or nuclear fusion programmes .
for those the budget is even increased without any discussion .
it is also striking that in particular the big member states with a major interest in the nuclear energy sector such as france , germany and the united kingdom are blocking save ii in the council .
it is time for us to tell the citizens of europe and of germany what game their governments are playing .
instead of new technologies they are exporting obsolescent nuclear technology they have no more use for in their own countries to central and eastern europe such as the ukraine .
countries in western europe , including the netherlands , have an enormous over-capacity in electricity .
the power-stations which supply this energy are proportionally much cleaner than power-stations in countries such as the ukraine . but these power-stations are standing here doing nothing .
they are superfluous .
my group asks the commission and the council why we do not export these gas-fired surplus power-stations to the ukraine where they can soon be supplying electricity .
as a last point i should like to advocate a european energy policy on behalf of my group , because without that there can be no question of a european environment policy .
madam president , i should like to thank mr mombaur for his excellent report .
it is unusual to be able to welcome so unreservedly a colleague 's report and i know that we do so tonight .
it is a really practical way for moving forward on renewable energies .
renewable energies present us with a paradox .
they are the oldest of all energy sources but nowadays modern technology permits us to use them efficiently and enables a new potential to be realized .
there are inexhaustible benefits and no pollution of the biosphere .
it is particularly important that the more than 50 % of the world 's population which is deprived of infrastructure , electricity and energy for development should be provided with decentralized infrastructures in a proper and concrete way .
we should regard this as an urgent priority .
the local production of photovoltaic energy on buildings makes renewable energy very competitive .
it secures jobs and ensures cooperation with the third world and the mediterranean in particular .
in this context , i should like to see more renewable energy used in public buildings in brussels and other places in the european union .
i know that the rapporteur has endeavoured to be realistic with his target of 15 % .
in the light of current practice , which is stagnant , this is a useful move forward .
i say that we can exceed this target and go for 20 % if we really try .
i should also like to agree with my colleagues who say we must have a real energy policy for the european union .
it is about time we had a proper energy policy for the european union and a proper environment policy .
we should have this with a legal base .
madam president , the rapporteur , whom i also want to congratulate on his first-class work , makes it crystal clear that it is urgently necessary for the commission to draw up a comprehensive action plan .
of course the eu can only promote and encourage a change of trend , because of the subsidiarity principle .
the final responsibility lies with the member states .
apart from the primary reasons that speak for this action plan , i want to draw attention to the positive effects on rural populations - in relation also to employment .
by promoting regional projects and activities new jobs can be created .
the market in technology for the use of renewable energy sources is a much contested future market precisely because of these circumstances .
public corporations should set an example in their investment projects , and that also applies to the european union 's public buildings .
in terms of organization , the european union should form the many individual responsibilities of the commission 's directorates-general into a uniform policy to promote renewable energy sources .
existing technologies should be promoted by increasing european investment in third countries , so as not to leave market shares in this promising area to competition .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i have tabled two amendments because i had a burning need to do so .
why ?
because the save ii programme , for which appropriations of ecu 150 m were proposed , was cut to ecu 45 m by the council .
just imagine : germany is referring to its subsidiarity , austria was actually in favour of it being cut to ecu 35 m .
quite incredible !
we are the model european country in terms of environmental standards and yet we are cutting precisely those programmes that help us to implement these environmental standards .
what the council has done here really is ludicrous !
that is why i think it is important to draw attention to this now and to say , that will not do !
that is not what the european parliament wants !
we want to support good programmes that help us to save energy and that is why the save ii programme should be allocated at least ecu 150 m if it is to be at all competitive .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i would first like to congratulate the rapporteur mr mombaur on his excellent report .
i regard this report as particularly important , for very many reasons .
finally , because it proposes a global policy for the sector of renewable energy sources , at a time that is critical for the future development of those energy sources .
i will not reiterate the benefits that would stem from intensified development of renewable energy sources , nor the need to promote them .
those subjects have been developed in detail , both by the rapporteur , and by the various previous speakers .
however , let me remind you that in the commission 's white paper on energy policy , it is stated that world demand for energy is forecast to increase in the coming years , the coming decades .
despite the improvement of energy efficiency , it is forecast that if present trends are maintained , the consumption of mineral resources will increase in order to satisfy our energy demands .
deposits of mineral energy sources and uranium are limited and it is becoming increasingly clear that fossil fuels harm the environment by emitting greenhouse gases and other pollutants as well .
clearly , alternative solutions are needed .
besides this , however , reliability of supply is one of the most basic issues that concern the european union , and one which entails community action as a priority .
the promotion of renewable energy sources must be a fundamental ingredient of these alternative solutions .
we therefore agree completely with mr mombaur 's essential aspirations , as expressed in his report .
as we have already stated in the white paper , and we agree with your own views , the commission will prepare an overall strategy and a plan of action to promote renewable energy sources .
i intend to present that document before the end of the year , in the form of a statement to parliament and the other institutional bodies , with an action programme which will propose new measures .
all this , of course , will take place after consultations with all the interested agencies .
in that context , we will of course analyse the action already taken by the commission in this specific area .
the research and demonstration activities promoted by the commission have played a very important part in improving the quality of the energy services provided by renewable energy sources , and in reducing the cost of constituents and systems .
besides , within the scope of the altener programme , which covers the years 1993-1997 , over 220 projects have been financed .
more particularly , there are plans for the support of around 60 further projects .
in addition , we have made substantial efforts to give out information within the scope of this action .
towards the end of this year , the commission will submit to parliament and to the council a proposal to extend the altener programme beyond 1997 .
and i would like to assure you that the commission will where possible take all of parliament 's comments into account .
personally , i assure you that i will promote the greatest possible coordination between the commission 's various services , by means of a coordinating group under my leadership , to prepare our strategy .
that coordination will have to be strengthened still further within the scope of putting our strategy into practice .
towards the end of november , the commission will organize a conference in spain for all contributors to and participants in the programme .
together with them , we will try to formulate conclusions based on experience so far and determine guidelines for our future orientation .
in conclusion , i would like to express my satisfaction that this report proposes to develop renewable energy sources in the mediterranean area .
i have personally undertaken the commitment to promote cooperation in the sector of energy in the mediterranean area . i hope my counterparts in the other mediterranean countries will also lay due stress upon renewable energy sources .
madam president , i would like to conclude by congratulating the rapporteur mr mombaur once more on the quality and importance of his work .
his report is one which largely strengthens and supplements the commission 's efforts in a sector which is vitally important for the future .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
population conference in cairo
the next item is the report ( a4-0152 / 96 ) by mrs fouque , on behalf of the committee on women 's rights , on the follow-up to the cairo international conference on population and development .
at istanbul , in june 1996 , the world community readopted as a priority objective the strengthening of women 's power to act in all areas and at all levels .
despite a few positive facts that have emerged since my report , the stocktake suggests that no significant progress has been made since cairo and that the main indicators are at red .
it is true that family planning is progressing , but there are still three hundred million women today with no access to contraceptives , and five hundred thousand throughout the world are dying as a consequence of pregnancy .
one hundred and fifty million remain handicapped for life as a result , 94 % of them in the developing countries .
but infection with the hiv virus is rampant among women and adolescent girls because of their sexual and economic subordination and lack of information .
it is true that the gap in life expectancy as between rich and poor countries is generally narrowing , but alarming declines are apparent in russia and in black africa .
it is true that women 's rights are being more widely recognized , both globally and in individual countries , yet their overall status has not improved .
indeed , it has actually deteriorated seriously as a result of religious fundamentalism , economic globalization and the increasing feminization not only of poverty but also of marginalization , discrimination and violence .
this means the indefinite deferment of sustainable development , since it can only be achieved if women contribute and participate on an equal footing with men .
black africa - which , for the sake of its own equilibrium , the european union cannot disregard - is the part of the world that has regressed most , in every aspect , during the 1990s .
malnutrition , aids , poverty and illiteracy are taking a massive physical and mental toll of the population there .
yet the us $ 17 , 000 million regarded as necessary to implement the cairo action programme has not been collected .
massive withdrawal of commitments , and little or nothing in the way of sustained new commitments , explain this .
a few days ago , in lyons , the g7 disclosed a disastrous reduction in public aid to development .
its level is the lowest it has been for twenty-five years .
in the united states , which formally provided 17 % of world aid to family planning in the developing countries , congress has just reduced this budget by 35 % .
the only states that are respecting their commitments are denmark , sweden , norway and the netherlands .
hats off to the netherlands , whose parliament has been pressurized by its members into raising the foreign aid budget for cairo to 4 % .
in germany , too , parliament has resolved that the first follow-up meeting to cairo should be held in hanover in 1999 , at the same time as the world exhibition .
the european union , for its part , has indeed unfrozen the funds which it committed in 1995 : ecu 50 million .
but administrative sluggishness and the lack of sufficient political will have prevented these commitments being used by their principal beneficiaries .
the european union has played an innovative role at all the world conferences , defending the principles of liberty and equality .
it has initiated a high-quality dialogue with the developing countries and worked for the recognition and application of women 's rights .
women , let us recall , are very often responsible for three types of production : production of life , domestic production and economic production .
they are the beating heart of a triple dynamic , no aspect of which can be isolated from the other two .
demography , development and democratization are their three burdens , and our three opportunities .
madam president , the rapporteur has already said it .
it is two years since the cairo conference was held and we note little result .
the states themselves and the international institutions as well have done hardly anything to follow up the undertakings they made there .
that is true too of the union , and here i am looking at the commissioner .
to a considerable extent that is because of lack of means , but above all shortage of staff both in brussels with the commission and with the establishments abroad .
that leads to unnecessary delays .
i think it is of great importance too for the commissioner to tell us how he would like to change this organization to give shape to projects of this kind in the future .
naturally it is very important to coordinate the budgets .
the committee on the environment is convinced that the question is not merely one of demographic population growth and increasing poverty but also of effective environmental responses .
a demographic policy can only be effective if it is part of a broader whole of measures to combat poverty and environmental threats .
this naturally involves projects and programmes for family planning , post-natal care and the prevention of aids .
may i , in conclusion , bring something to the commissioner 's attention in this respect .
i read this morning in a dutch newspaper that aids will really affect the demographic prospects of 20 or 30 african countries .
madam president , first of all warm thanks to mrs fouque , whose report provides an excellent basis for further union activities in the field of population and development policy .
the icpd in cairo represented a historic turning-point in the history of un population conferences .
the icpd action programme reflects a worldwide and far-reaching vision while at the same time achieving agreement on the key questions , on highly sensitive questions which , after all , affect people in the most personal way .
this term signals an integral entitlement to health , family planning , contraception , safe sex and safe birth .
the decisive advances achieved after more than three years of negotiations recognize the close interconnections between the areas of population development , poverty , education , production and consumer behaviour and environmental policy .
for the first time , at un level , women were named as the decisive , key figures in relation to future development .
the message of cairo - that women are the key to development - also dominated the action plan and made it incontrovertibly clear that equality for women in all areas must be a requirement of all policies and programmes .
the report gives a very good account of the situation and the problems involved .
i will therefore confine myself to a few additional remarks .
the birth rate has fallen in every part of the world except in africa south of the sahara where it remains 6.2 births per woman .
in the threshold countries , some of which have double-figure growth rates , the birth rates are close to the european ones , as are women 's educational and job opportunities .
on average , women who have attended school marry five years later than uneducated girls and have their first child four years later and overall have three children fewer .
the real squanderers of the environment and of resources are clearly pinpointed as the highly-developed industrialized countries .
that is why the two key concepts of cairo - reproductive health and the empowerment of women - must be regarded as closely linked , and the beijing world conference on women consistently developed these concepts further .
yet it was noted in beijing that insufficient resources were being allocated and that there was a far-reaching rise in poverty , marginalization , discrimination and violence against women .
let me ask the council , let me ask the commission , what has happened to the target of allocating 0.7 % of gross national product to development cooperation ?
my country , the federal government , spends less than 0.3 % on this important task , although it has agreed to made greater efforts and increase the expenditure .
i appeal to the sense of responsibility of the member states and the commission and call on them to carry out the follow-up measures rapidly and to increase the appropriations .
i ask all members not to fail to support the well-balanced motion for a resolution in the fouque report .
contraceptive methods can only work if they are used in agreement with those concerned , which means with the women .
we are categorically against compulsory sterilization , as is practised on women in china , for instance .
but if women decide on it freely , then sterilization is a good method .
that is to say , we need agreed methods .
we social democrats therefore call for a continuous follow-up process and for the cairo and beijing proposals to be implemented consistently , with the participation of those concerned .
so we are at the half-way point and it is appropriate to take stock .
i should like to remind you briefly that the report tackles the world demographic problem from the point of view not only of economics but of ethics .
that cairo conference highlights the growth of world population by 94 million a year , 90 % of which is in the poorest countries .
if demographic growth continues at that rate , by 2050 there will be 10 000 million people in the world .
the cairo conference has very specific aims : to reduce deaths from childbirth and infant mortality , to promote access to genetic health , family planning and to prevent aids and to make primary education available to all .
that will require resources . 17 000 million dollars by the year 2000 .
everyone knows what hopes the world places on the european union for its pioneering role in encouraging democratic freedoms , the rights of women and equality of opportunity .
our free dialogue with the developing countries and the union 's economic contribution to cooperation have placed us ahead of the united states .
the european union should be a mirror in which all countries can see their reflection .
we men and women of europe must be capable of innovation and flexibility in our approach .
in that way we shall be pursuing a preventive policy whereas today , in medical terms , we are pursuing only a curative policy .
madam president , i should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent in-depth report on the present situation on the follow-up to the cairo conference .
women in the developing world are facing a precarious situation .
we are witnessing an enormous population explosion which is concentrated in the poorest countries of the world .
many of these countries have limited resources and are incapable of dealing with the demands of their growing populations .
as the rapporteur has already said , women are among the main victims of debt in the developing countries .
an exception must be made for developing countries .
it is an appalling indictment of international policies that 70 % of the 1.4 billion people living below the poverty threshold are women .
they are discriminated against in many ways , not just politically and socially but in terms of health and education .
furthermore , 150 million women are left with long-term illness or disability as a result of pregnancy .
there are twice as many women as men among the new aids cases - a fact which has already been referred to here tonight .
some 9 million women are hiv-positive .
i am appalled by the suggestion in the report that women in developing countries are being used as guinea pigs for experiments involving new contraceptive products .
i deplore and condemn this .
any company doing this should be banned and forced to pay massive compensation .
i would call on the commission to examine this situation as a matter of urgency .
illiteracy remains a serious problem .
this is generally evident from the fact that of 960 million illiterate adults in the world , two-thirds are women .
furthermore of the 130 million illiterate children in the world , 90 million do not have access to primary education .
not even these figures reveal the full picture of the situation in which women find themselves , who often have to bear the brunt of poverty and the consequences of the policies of exclusion in developing countries .
i look forward to the first assessment of cairo which will be held in hanover in 1999 .
it is therefore necessary to guarantee and to promote women 's education , their access to employment , their health training , information on their rights as regards voluntary parenthood and access to methods of birth control .
madam president , i shall begin a little differently .
every child not born in the west makes a considerably greater contribution to saving natural resources than every child not born in the developing countries .
that is perhaps rather an odd way to begin , but by that i do not mean that we ought to do nothing about the population explosion .
it is true , as is said here , that not very much has happened since cairo .
i should like to press the commission to arrange as quickly as possible , in cooperation with the united nations , for the development of framework agreements to implement as quickly as possible the decisions taken in cairo .
i think that is much more important than old traditional patterns of family planning because they , as has been clear for a long time , do not work all that well .
i will however take the liberty of saying , mrs fouque , that i am aware of a certain inconsistency between that statement and the continuation of your report .
i would however thank you for having stressed that there has been a welcome reversal in attitudes .
this finding suggests to me that we must , when dealing with these conferences and topics , come to the point of really questioning our own economic development in our so-called wealthy countries .
we should completely reorganize international trade , the international ground rules , so that the purpose of international trade is not to benefit financial interests at the expense of the various nations , developed countries as well as developing .
all world economic development must be geared to satisfying the fundamental and basic needs of food , shelter and health care in these various countries .
because these evils are linked : our 18 million unemployed , the 50 million citizens of the union afflicted by poverty and exclusion , and the difficulties experienced by the developing countries .
these are not two separate realities , they are two inseparable realities .
from this point of view i have insufficient time , but i believe there could be enough of us prepared to decide to change our international economic analysis .
now let me stress one particular point .
however , women do not have access to this knowledge .
this is a profoundly shocking finding in terms of that selfdetermination for women to which we are committed .
i would also like to say that these methods have the virtue of treating men and women equally in terms of their responsibility for procreation .
finally , one last point .
poverty has a serious impact on single women with children .
violence constantly increases and disrespect for human life is a daily practice in many countries .
every effort should be made to subject traditions and customs that cheapen human life to scrutiny or review .
in many countries , of course , such traditions are lost in the mists of antiquity .
however , such traditions and practices ought not to be used continually as an excuse by certain elements of authority to preserve the status quo .
the need for access to education and information is now essential , and i would say , even urgent .
there is also discrimination in education .
most illiterates are women , because they are not recognized as having the right of access to education .
the european union 's role , then , must be a catalytic one but not only in approaching the issue from an economic standpoint .
i applaud the aim of increasing the amount available from the european union to 300 million ecu by 2000 .
however , i am concerned that no applications have been received from mediterranean countries .
and if the reason for this is the complexity of the procedure , perhaps we ought to review that procedure .
the european union should also encourage information campaigns for the citizens concerning their rights , training and information programmes , and programmes relating to the health of women and children .
in addition , it should also encourage ngos to undertake initiatives , because their contribution is direct and effective .
i thank mrs fouque for her excellent work and hope the commission will respond to our appeal .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , first i should like to thank mrs fouque for her excellent and well-balanced report .
that new regulation is specifically linked to a modest budget heading - ecu 7 million in 1996 - although its real significance is much more important in political terms , as i shall try to show later .
the regulation will give priority to innovative pilot projects , catalyst programmes and operational research work .
to pursue these priorities the commission proposes to concentrate community aid on :
the average for budgetary appropriations for commitment from 1991 to 1994 - and i mean financial commitments under the community budget - has gone up to ecu 20 million a year .
total commitments for 1995 have gone up to some ecu 45 million .
to put it another way , from 1994 to 1995 the community budget for implementing the cairo conference has doubled .
as regards 1996 , the present financial year , we are hoping - this is the commission 's proposal - to be able to increase our commitments for these policies on demography and women to some ecu 90 million .
naturally it is debatable whether any budget is enough .
believe me , as a commissioner , i should be tremendously happy if i could rely on the support of parliament , which , as i say , is part of the budgetary authority .
what could please me more than your being able to give me more funds and to let me have more officials !
mrs fouque , however , puts forward a series of ideas which at least i should like to introduce in collaboration with my colleague , mr pinheiro , who has responsibility for the lom&eacute; convention .
it is by no means correct , as her report states , that only ecu 2.8 million have been spent in the context of the lom&eacute; convention .
ecu 20 million have been spent this year on projects located in kenya , malawi and above all in the caribbean .
in any event the commission is making an effort to include in all its population programmes the objectives which you set out in your report .
the commission believes that the motion for a resolution is clear about what line should be followed .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
women and olympic games
madam president , may i start by presenting the apologies of mrs castellina , the chairman of the committee on culture .
unfortunately she could not be here this evening and so i am to speak for her and so presumably also on behalf of the committee on culture .
i must say we were naturally rather shocked when it appeared at the olympic games in barcelona that no fewer than 33 countries decided not to give women a chance to take part in the olympic games .
naturally that is quite unacceptable and also entirely contrary to the olympic idea , in which discrimination , whether on grounds of sex , race or anything else is of course fundamentally wrong .
i must say that these are not only the islamic countries .
let me dispel that myth , because that is so easy to say , but it is not only the islamic countries which make themselves guilty of this sex discrimination .
there are also other countries such as laos , uruguay , the british virgin islands and the american samoan islands .
i mention only a few countries which do not belong to the islamic range .
we do not know how it will be this time , but in barcelona it could only be called simply shocking that of the 9 368 who took part only 2 108 were women .
that jolly well ought to be changed .
the responsibility naturally lies with the olympic committee , which of course should refuse to allow these countries to take part in the games , but it does not lie solely with them .
i should also like to know from the commission if it can indicate more precisely which of the countries to which it gives aid are guilty of this .
i am speaking on behalf of the chairman of the committee on development and cooperation , mr kouchner .
politics were dragged into the olympic games a long time ago . i remember 1936 when a black american sprinter was refused the award for his victory .
in 1979 , unfortunately also in germany , there was an attack in munich by palestinians , then palestinian terrorists , on the israeli delegation . now in 1996 the palestinians themselves have come with a team .
so that brought us in the committee on development and cooperation to the question raised by mr kouchner in committee whether these acp and ala countries are supported by europe in sports activities . that is the first question .
the second question is actually whether the commission should and could declare that teams which quite deliberately do not include women must not be admitted to the olympic games .
naturally an exception can be made for a country like the solomon islands or tonga which perhaps send only one competitor .
but i think that you have to draw a limit perhaps with teams which have more than three or four members .
if it is then quite clear that women are deliberately not included , then we are dealing with deliberate exclusion and that is entirely against the principle of the olympic games .
i hope to have an answer from mr mar&iacute;n to those two questions , the original question and the supplementary one .
no such sports cooperation exists .
perhaps the international olympic committee will be able to explain to you much better than i can why , within the international olympic movement this type of situation is permitted .
in 1992 , 169 nations entered this top competition , of which 35 were all-male teams , including teams from iran , kuwait and pakistan ; other countries have also been named during this debate .
in some islamic countries women are barred from sports on principle or are unable to participate because of strict dress codes .
sometimes , sportswomen from these countries are even threatened by fundamentalist groups .
in the field of top-class sport there have in fact always been discussions about human rights , which is a good thing .
top-class sport is the shop window of a society , but at the same time it reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the countries concerned .
south africa , for example , as an apartheid state , only chose whites for their teams , islamic fundamentalist countries only choose men for their olympic teams .
that is why a group was founded after the barcelona games in 1992 , the atlanta plus committee , by a number of personalities who supported the aim of abolishing discrimination in sport .
logically speaking , the international olympic committee should now exclude those delegations that discriminate against women .
let us leave aside the exceptions that mrs van putten mentioned here , namely if people do not satisfy olympic qualification criteria , for that is another question .
but where it really is a case of discrimination against women , the countries concerned must be excluded .
atlanta plus , this campaign , has now become a movement supported by many sports personalities and politicians , yet the international olympic committee is hesitating and the european governments are remaining silent .
she defied the defamation and threats by islamic extremists who wanted to ban women entirely from public appearance .
her courageous attitude excited general public interest , for contempt of human life and contempt for women are closely related .
racism and sexism have the same roots .
europe must not remain passive here .
the council must call on the ioc to ban teams that discriminate on the basis of gender and this can and must be followed by sanctions .
we will not admit any new form of apartheid against women and vigorously support the aims of the atlanta plus movement against the exclusion of women from sport !
perhaps it is the responsibility of the national and international committees to open discussions with those countries , to try and understand them , and to teach them the olympic spirit of freedom and democracy .
the word ' communication ' is of feminine gender in many languages , and it would perhaps be useful for everybody if the gentlemen on the olympic committee invited more women to join their ranks .
women could respond to that dialogue and so promote womens ' athletics and their participation in international competition .
let us therefore not lose time .
the year 2000 is approaching , and is already just around the corner .
we must remember that in ancient times all virtues were personified : democracy , freedom , and victory were represented by women , while the olympic games were represented by a man .
yet , women and men together lived on olympus in peace and harmony .
and it is those female virtues which the world today unfortunately finds it difficult or refuses to recognise or respect .
madam president , in south africa we have seen what effect a sports boycott may have on a country itself .
in practice sport plays an important part in promoting human rights .
i should like to mention that to mrs mouskouri .
in doing so i make it clear that liberals do not want to interfere by means of sport in the general internal politics of a country .
sport is not the proper instrument for that .
the olympic charter already states that discrimination on grounds of race , religion , politics , sex or otherwise is unacceptable , so sex is covered .
in 1992 in barcelona 34 countries systematically excluded women a breach of human rights .
the international olympic committee shrouded itself in silence and even gave way to the blackmail of iran , which did not want a woman to carry its standard at the official opening .
and now , when the atlanta games start on 19 july 35 countries , primarily islamic countries , mrs van dijk , have systematically and deliberately not included women .
again we hear silence from the ioc .
we think that is scandalous .
why does the ioc not respect its own olympic charter ?
commissioner mar&iacute;n , we shall indeed have to ask the ioc .
the eyes of the whole world are on atlanta .
women athletes have an important function as a symbol and an example , certainly in traditional societies , but also with us and so we want to give a clear political sign in a constructive way .
secondly we call upon the ioc and the international sports federations to exclude from participation in future countries which breach the olympic charter .
i also press for us to apply the human rights clause clearly ourselves when we conclude eu cooperation agreements with third countries .
let us not forget beijing .
there the eu said clearly : women 's rights are human rights .
finally the ioc , which moreover has only one woman director , will only consider a boycott , it is said , after international discussion and condemnation .
so we are ready to answer their call .
let us , together with the ioc and the international federations , show the world that we are in earnest about human rights .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , nothing has changed .
as in barcelona in 1992 , women are once again being prevented from taking part in the olympic games in atlanta this year .
islamic countries in particular are not allowing them to take part in sports under their own responsibility .
girls and women cannot train in these countries , are prevented from participating by dress codes , often threatened by fundamentalist groups and of course not nominated .
as in the days of barcelona there are now probably some 35 states that will send all-male teams to the usa .
this clear infringement of the olympic charter is unacceptable .
it is irreconcilable with the idea of the olympic movement for people to be discriminated against on grounds of religion , politics or sex .
the accusation that action was taken too late is not correct .
lissy gr&ouml;ner rightly pointed that out .
a whole 500 days before atlanta , at the beginning of january 1995 , committed women in paris founded the atlanta plus committee and contacted national sport authorities , sportsmen and sportswomen , with some success .
but the answer they received from the international olympic committee , the ioc , was terrible .
it had the presumption to say that atlanta plus ' proposal was a politically motivated attack on a religion .
any restriction on women 's elementary rights in sport , education and health , as in the professional world , is unacceptable .
this has been the subject of repeated debates and decisions , including those taken at the international conference on population in cairo in 1994 and the fourth world conference on women in beijing in 1995 .
the exclusion of women from the olympic movement merits only one answer : sanctions .
they must no longer be accredited , they must be suspended .
countries in which girls and women are prevented from realising their potential cannot and must not receive material or political support from the european union .
we must confront them with the need to change , for the sake of the realization of human rights .
the resolution submitted by our committee on women 's rights deserves the support of the european parliament , the commission and the council .
madam president , thank you for giving me the floor so late in the evening and at such short notice .
i am of course in agreement with what all my colleagues have just said , the more so since it was i who tabled the first motion for a resolution .
i think this point was worth repeating .
i have received one motion for a resolution pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
( the sitting was closed at 12.20 a.m. )
mr wolf may speak for one minute to make a personal statement .
president santer reacted irritably to my question yesterday and accordingly congratulated himself on the fact that he was not descending to my level .
a member from one of the large groups asked me whether i would accept that as it stood .
surely no self-respecting parliament can allow itself to be attacked in this way by an executive !
that is why i want to explain my question yesterday and clarify some personal questions which president santer brought up .
firstly , mr santer is an honourable man in his own choice of words .
i had no intention of saying nor did i say anything that would cast any doubt about that .
ladies and gentlemen , i very much hope that you will realise that here i am addressing a common concern of this house .
mr president , following that last intervention , i would not want parliament to associate itself with this remark , because it referred to respect for parliament .
parliament is respected to the extent that parliament itself respects the other institutions .
the manner in which mr wolf addressed mr santer yesterday was not a mark of respect .
mr herman , ladies and gentlemen , we are not going to open a debate on this question .
mr wolf , in accordance with rule 108 - personal statements - has made use of the legitimate right which the rules of procedure give him .
what he said was addressed to the commission .
any reference which might have been made to that institution has been explained by mr herman .
we shall not therefore start a discussion on this question which has now been considered in accordance with the provisions of rule 108 of our rules of procedure .
commercial transactions , capital markets and information networks
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
mr president , there are very pessimistic statements going round about the industrial prospects for the union .
a draft communication on european industrial competitiveness from the commission paints a very gloomy picture .
our position is deteriorating every year compared with america and japan .
many people have spoken about the 18 million unemployed and the 50 million on the breadline .
starting with that pessimistic note , we have a bright star on our european economic horizon , namely the potential of small and medium-sized enterprises to create jobs .
i am calling for more information than the commission has given us .
at the outset i want to say that i accept the one amendment tabled .
it also recognizes the need for more information .
the idea is quite a simple one .
compared with big businesses , small businesses are at a disadvantage when they seek access to funding .
they often do not have the collateral .
yet , if they could just get the money on loan at reasonable terms they could create jobs for us .
so here is the practical arrangement . the bankers acting as intermediaries may lend at 2 % less than the standard interest rate for a period of five years .
the amount available is ecu 30 , 000 multiplied by the number of jobs to be created . there is a very practical step .
for my own part , i wonder whether the dissemination of information about this scheme is satisfactory .
banks are not being encouraged to advertise this .
they say it might distort competition .
european information centres , where they exist , do a good job but there are not enough .
in an area such as mine there is one but as it is a very large area many people do not know about this .
as an mep representing a specific geographical area i try to disseminate information to bodies such as the federation of small businesses .
so , the scheme is in place but is not sufficiently publicized .
however , one has to say that the commission has reported considerable success .
some member states , however , have not taken up the allocation .
we have to find out from the commission why this is .
why are some states not seizing on this and why do some have a greater success in job creation than others ?
why do some find that they can create a job with a smaller loan than others ?
these are some of the extra bits of information i am sure we would find useful if the commission can step up the considerable statistical work it already does .
by july 1995 , 95 % of the total resources were allocated so the commission is reporting this as a considerable success .
but we need to know more so that we can do a better job of getting the money where it could be best used .
the committee on budgets suggests that there should be a more favourable attitude to small and medium-sized businesses in peripheral areas .
naturally , representing the highlands and islands of scotland , i would agree with that .
every job there is of such vital importance to the whole survival of communities .
i welcome the change in the attitude to what is meant by small and medium-sized enterprises .
i welcome the division of the criteria into the very small ( under 10 jobs ) , the small ( 10 to 50 jobs ) and the medium ( 50 to 250 jobs ) .
i would like to think that the elise programme which i welcome very much should concentrate on the very small and the small . that is where the greatest number of jobs will be created .
the commission boasts that 42 , 000 jobs have been created .
we need to know more about where these are and in what sectors of economic activity .
perhaps the commission could give us this extra information .
parliament welcomes this scheme being extended and expanded .
mr president , small businesses is big business for the european union as we strive for growth recovery in jobs .
small capital markets are potentially big for us and for europe 's small but fastgrowing firms , the expansion of which depends on regular shots of fast capital at their most explosive stage of development .
get these smes on the travelator of success and we can really be seen to be helping to tackle the scourge of unemployment which still disfigures the eu in too many of its member states .
i should make it clear at this point that the earlier references to easdaq in my text should be replaced by the term pan-european small capital markets .
all these new markets borrow ideas from the world 's most successful small capital market , america 's nasdaq , its most famous listing being microsoft itself .
not only is nasdaq the forcing-house of american fast-track smes but it is also the home to european companies thirsty for capital .
how crazy !
why are we in europe not providing home pitches for our domestic smes and finance institutions to come together and marry their finance and their entrepreneurial flair for europe and europeans ' benefit .
well , now we are , and the commission 's report is a response to this fast-changing situation .
parliament can strongly support the commission 's communication reporting on the feasibility of creating what are more europe-wide capital markets , another distinctive feature of which would be the electronic screen-based nature of the marketplace .
such a development is the way of the future and threatens those existing market locations which remain flat-footed in their thinking and their response to a changing market scheme .
but parliament calls for caution to be mixed with enthusiasm .
we believe that issues of liquidity , regulation and possible protectionism have to be addressed .
we call upon member states , for instance , to repeal restrictions on pension fund investments in securities listings or exchanges in other member states and in unlisted securities .
we are , after all , in a single market and we should make that single domestic market work for our own small businesses .
but hand-in-hand with this liberalization should go the strict observance of prudential rules established by appropriate regulatory authorities .
in addition , access to small capital markets should be facilitated .
entrance fees should not be prohibitive .
investors should not be discriminated against fiscally in terms of double taxation or capital gains tax because they choose to buy shares that are listed in a market located in another member state .
insofar as we can , we should ensure that the duplication of markets does not take place such that we divide our effort to set up an alternative to america 's nasdaq .
on present evidence we will avoid that problem .
to interest big institutional investors we need the highest standards of regulation , perhaps a european securities and exchange commission .
the prospectus approval system must be streamlined by harmonization or by mutual recognition .
finally , i reiterate the point that the introduction of the euro as our single currency will heighten the attractions of a small capital market for all europe 's fastgrowing hi-tech companies .
indeed , any such pan-european market will itself be an appropriate means of channelling european investment funds .
i welcome the commission 's report .
on late payments , recently in my home town of chester , i was approached by a small firm which was suffering cash-flow problems as a result of a big firm paying late .
their problem was intensified , however , by the fact that their supplier in the chain of added-value business was a business in sweden where payment times are short due to the far-sighted payment practices endemic to scandinavia .
two other firms in my constituency in ellesmere port and crewe name the culprit late payers as the european commission itself .
mention of my role as parliament 's rapporteur on this vexed subject prompted payment double quick but these are all too familiar stories in europe today .
it is time to call it the last supper for those who deliberately flout proper business practice by paying their colleagues late .
in any other parlance we would call these people cheats and they certainly swindle the small businesses which go to the wall after such daylight robbery .
late payment is , arguably , smes biggest problem .
it is a worsening rather than improving situation .
as the commission 's recommendation reveals , the outlook is bleak for those businesses which attempt to trade across borders .
how do we right this wrong ?
how do we help smes regain monies which might otherwise be used profitably to invest in growing small businesses and producing jobs for europe 's jobless .
remember we are talking megabucks here .
the uk-based forum of private business calculates that the british smes are deprived of &pound; 20bn at any one moment in the business cycle through late payments .
my answer - and i hope parliament 's too - will be a directive aimed at introducing a statutory right to interest for firms paid unwarrantably late .
such a system could encourage a virtuous circle where prompt payment becomes the norm not the exception .
existing swedish legislation and the us prompt payment act have each transformed the business culture .
we must act here for all the european single market , perhaps targeting first all public institutions like governments and local authorities .
the penalty of a statutory right to interest is where europe can score right between the posts and bring succour and soccer to europe 's level playing-field for its sme entrepreneurs .
i implore the commission to bring forward a directive with this purpose in mind .
in the meantime we will naturally support all the other worthy ideas set out in the commission communication .
all these carrots of encouragement are bland without the stick of a statutory right to interest .
this is the linchpin in tackling trade 's toughest task .
as parliamentarians we must ensure that small businesses are given the true opportunity they should have by acting on late payments .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , first of all i should like to support the hendrick report on the future organization and operation of the information and cooperation networks .
the incorporation of computerized communication networks in business is fundamental in an interconnected , open world such as we now live in .
i should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the telecommunications council on approving the harmonized rules for protecting data of a personal nature .
i regard it as a first step in seeking solutions at european level , the oecd level and on a world scale in this field .
with regard to the hendrick report on the other hand i must confess that i have my doubts about his view that these communication networks and so on can create employment in line with the delors report .
i should like to consider the statement that there will be an automatic net creation of jobs , as was mentioned .
there is no doubt that strengthening new technologies , processes and procedures creates employment , but unfortunately harsh reality confirms that frequently more jobs are lost than are created .
so i basically support the rapporteur 's report and i should like to add certain details about the networks as regards third countries .
it is obvious that virtually all countries observe the rules of the free-market economy and consequently immense markets are emerging in asia , central america , south america , central and eastern europe and so on .
a transnational basis consequently needs to be established for business relations .
such links , such networks serve to promote cooperation and must incorporate support for those bodies which have the most direct contact with the actual business world , such as chambers of commerce , trade guilds and the like .
what are the main existing networks ?
the euro info centres , the business cooperation networks , the business cooperation centres and so on .
what are the results ?
to put it briefly , they are all being pooled in order to develop these networks .
however , the evaluation of the results varies greatly according to the network .
their effectiveness could be greatly improved and they should be brought closer to the business world .
distribution is not homogeneous as regards human resources .
i am referring to the quality .
there is a risk of developing variable-speed networks .
operation of the networks is not sufficiently decentralized and is too bureaucratic .
to sum up , i should like to emphasize the importance of these networks .
we note their disparity , we think it is important to consolidate them and we welcome the new phase which is dawning with the information offices .
i therefore repeat my thanks to the commission for the progress made along these lines .
mr president , the most serious problem faced today by europe and european society is the very high level of unemployment that prevails , which threatens the fabric of social and economic life .
unfortunately , the european union has not so far been able to develop a long-term and cohesive policy to promote employment , which would include among other things funding for infrastructure projects , networks , etc .
there are proposals .
there is the white paper of president delors and the recent confidence agreement by president santer .
what is lacking , is the political will to provide the necessary funding .
it relates to smes , which are the backbone of business activity in many member states and which are the main sector in which new jobs can be created .
the report describes the course so far of this loan facilitation and must be welcomed because it demonstrates that substantial progress has indeed been made , while the measure as such has worked relatively well .
it is significant that 42 , 000 new jobs have been created so far .
yet , a number of comments concerning the problem should be made :
mr president , i rise to present my report to parliament and to say that the exercise of compiling this report was extremely gratifying .
i have been very interested in the work that the european information centres have been carrying out both in the uk and elsewhere around the european union .
as many of you will know , the enterprise policy for the european union began approximately six years ago and these centres have been in operation for that period .
the people at the centre were very keen to show me examples and case studies of businesses they had worked with and how people had benefited from their activities .
i was particularly interested in how the networks function and the fact that we have this network across europe .
it is doing much to foster enterprise and trade across the european union .
i have recently come from a bbc tv interview where they asked me some very clear questions about what the benefits of these centres are to the community .
my report focuses on two particular areas .
firstly , as i have already said , it is clear that significant amounts of european union funds go into these centres .
therefore , at a time when the finances of the community are under scrutiny , it is important that we begin to quantify the value of the work they are doing .
that means we need to measure the benefits of the centres as against the costs .
as the commission report itself points out , no significant amount of work has been done to assess the benefits .
some measure of customer or client satisfaction is obviously required to determine the benefits and then to weigh those against the costs .
at the moment people in these centres feel they are doing a good job .
they are fostering enterprise and promoting business but it is difficult to say how many businesses they are helping and how successful that help is .
it may be just that the centre has pointed a business in the right direction and it takes the business some time to link up with another company .
for example , a company which sells bolts and wishes to sell in france needs to be matched up with a company in france that wants to buy bolts .
it is this matching process which may only take hours but in some cases can take months .
i have also suggested that , as we are moving towards an information society in the next century , the centres do as much as they can to benefit from the new technologies which are becoming available .
i would like to see the centres begin to introduce these new techniques so that the enterprise policy for the european union can move into the next century .
with those comments , i ask parliament to support my report .
mr president , the severe employment , or rather unemployment situation in europe has created a general interest in supporting the activities of small and medium-sized enterprises .
the social democrats have been very active in this respect both regarding budgeting and other matters .
the same applies to our position at the national , provincial and local level .
it is understandable that small and medium-sized companies naturally operate in the surroundings most familiar to them .
it is quite natural that a majority of the problems encountered by small and medium-sized companies originate from sources local to the companies .
i however believe that networking and the availability of information will for example increase the knowledge of business culture in new member states .
the nordic countries , as we know , are not known for the prominent position of their small and medium-sized companies .
but employment can also be improved by using these networks .
from the point of view of developing internal markets , particularly in the high-tec sector , small and medium-sized companies are of great importance .
they , however , face problems which have been discussed here today , particularly financing .
national frontiers and monetary transactions also cause great difficulties to small companies .
it goes without saying that small companies require & # x02bc ; soft ' finance and that the need for risk financing is particularly great at present .
after all one billion ecu is not a lot of money .
it is less than three ecu per capita , so increasing the amount should not present any difficulties .
the price of money is one problem , and another problem is that the guarantees are inadequate .
we should also be able to make progress in this area .
the eu should make sure that there is also enough competition in all member states in financing , and that small and medium-sized companies are not unreasonably squeezed in this respect .
in this connection i would like to describe briefly the situation in my own country by giving you a practical example .
finland has an advantage over other countries in as much as the number of qualified engineers is relatively high .
in the rest of europe there is a shortage in this particular sector of the work force , and it should therefore be made available to these countries .
one alternative is of course mobility of labour , which however also causes social problems .
it is therefore better that such engineering work is sold by companies to its users .
i know of a company whose exports account for 80 % of its business .
last year this company 's loss due to currency fluctuations was greater than its net profit , which illustrates the dilemma .
the culture of late payment in the rest of europe is another major problem for these companies .
companies are forced to double their capital in relation to domestic requirements when operating abroad .
if these innovative engineers are having to face currency and financing problems , they lose sight of the main objective , and suddenly they are no longer designing raw material and energy-saving ships which could improve european competitiveness .
finally i would like to point out that in any circumstances currency is a factor , and problems facing small and medium-sized companies cannot be overcome until we have a common currency .
mr president , today there are four reports on the agenda which have a bearing on the position of european small- and medium-sized enterprises in the internal market .
yesterday too in the debate about simplification of legislation the concept of smes occurred repeatedly .
the position of small- and mediumscale businesses is a little like that of women .
the target group is large and appealing and they are discussed at length , but very little is done .
take for example the squabbling about the budget for the european multiannual programmes for small-and medium-scale businesses .
we are thinking of the ecu 180 million which the commission needs in order to carry out its action programme properly .
a sphere in which the european union has a clear responsibility , which it actually accepts , is the establishment of mechanisms for giving small- and medium-scale businesses access to risk-bearing capital .
mrs ewing rightly remarks that the temporary lending facility of the european investment bank has been a success , but not in every country .
parliament increased this budget heading for 1996 to ecu 50 million .
i see it as a continuation of the growth and environment budget heading which i had to defend almost with my life in this parliament in 1995 and 1996 .
i hope that will be a success so that the elise programme may also be a success .
it is unusually accessible and very unbureaucratic , so it should deserve genuine success .
secondly my group is glad that something is being done with the establishment of the easdaq , the european exchange for high-growth innovative companies with trans-frontier ambitions .
how many of those firms are actually planning to come over to the easdaq ?
this would enable us to estimate the credibility and liquidity of this future pan-european exchange .
it will have to be attractive for investors to invest their money and for firms to put their shares on this exchange .
the european association of securities dealers would perhaps be the appropriate body to recommend this market to investors .
one european measure to improve the liquidity of the market might consist in the abolition of national restrictions with regard to investment of pension funds in stocks and shares .
the recent pronouncements of commissioner monti about summoning a number of member states , namely italy and denmark , before the european court because of a restrictive policy for those pension funds give hope for the future .
it goes without saying that there must be clarity with regard to the relationship between the future easdaq and the existing national and regional exchanges in connection with undesirable overlapping and competition .
now is the moment of truth .
in 1994 , the ecofin council held that , in certain circumstances , the loans granted could be the subject of interest-rate subsidies financed from the community budget .
only those loans made within the framework of the eib 's sme mechanism are eligible , and the subsidies - granted for a period of five years - are fixed at 2 % .
in other words , a loan granted at a rate of 8.5 % per annum , for example , costs the borrower only 6.5 % per annum , the difference being paid from the union 's budget .
for some time now it has been apparent that some member states were committing only a small proportion of the funds appropriated to them .
it is clear that these delays in the appropriation of resources are prejudicial to potential borrowers in the member states .
consequently , we support the rapporteur when he invites the commission and the eib to examine why these delays are occurring .
mrs ewing 's report is approved by our group as a whole , though we would enter certain reservations .
i should remind you that the original mechanism was intended to promote investment to create jobs , not to subsidise the creation of jobs .
any comparison between enterprises or between states thus appears somewhat random .
similarly , we consider that it is not a matter for the states to assess what is the most effective vector for promoting and organizing this type of mechanism .
furthermore , article 10 appears to us to be unfounded in that its effective functioning does not presuppose the creation of a joint committee which would prove to be an ad hoc supervisory body .
finally , ladies and gentlemen , our group will support the report by mr hendrick and mr harrison .
however , this initiative will be conclusive only if the obstacles relating to liquidity , regulation and the risks of protectionism are attended to .
mr president , regarding the future economic structure small enterprises are no doubt of great interest .
but at the same time we should not have a too idealistic and optimistic view of their ability to create new jobs .
firstly small companies are of divergent types .
subcontractors are very different from companies operating in the consumer goods market .
small companies in different lines of business also have different opportunities .
secondly , a great number of small companies are established , but a fair number also go under .
many companies have a limited life , which also decreases the effectiveness of subsidies of a general character .
although the purpose of subsidies and lower interest rates is good , it is questionable whether they are effective when there is a general economic depression .
sweden 's experience of reduced social costs for example is that they are practically worthless .
a current survey of small companies in sweden shows that most companies blame a weak market as the source of their difficulties .
and this is evidently the conclusion to be drawn , that ultimately macroeconomic policy is the decisive factor as regards small companies contribution to job creation .
the current deflationary policy in europe restricts opportunities for small companies .
thank you , mr president .
mrs peijs , i would like to compliment you on the energetic manner in which you always raise the question of the smes and put forward your arguments , many of which i agree with .
i am very glad to see how energetically you keep doing so , in our committee and here in parliament .
the council should not only take that to heart , that is one aspect , but should also take a closer look at the problems of the smes in europe .
for small and medium-sized enterprises and the policy vis &agrave; vis these enterprises represent the policy for the basis of employment in europe .
basically , in terms of support measures the smes still come off worst in comparison with large firms , with shortterm industrial projects , especially in rural areas .
now one could say that these are the usual arguments put forward by parliamentarians , who always want more and more and are never satisfied .
that is not the case .
i regard the elise programme as a very good project .
and it will bear fruit .
my request to the commission and the council , and especially to the council , is that they draw up a more consistent and well thought-out general plan for the smes .
we also support mr hendrick 's proposal , which mrs hautala will be discussing in a moment .
mr president , this is an extremely important issue .
i am talking on mr harrison 's report in particular and i should like to congratulate him on the way he set out his report .
he has pinpointed the issues which confront in a quite stark way many of the small industries and small enterprises on which europe depends for its growth .
this is obviously an issue of great concern to many small firms .
one has to say that the bad boys are not just other commercial firms but very often public bodies .
i am reliably informed that the uk government , including the scottish office , is one of the worst offenders .
this is simply not good enough and i am delighted that some steps have been taken to redress this situation .
the concept of an sri , a statutory entitlement to interest on overdue payments , is at the heart of the attempts to redress the situation .
if we were able to achieve this at one stroke across the europe we would achieve a tremendous amount for employment and for the generation of confidence .
for all the speeches that are made in this august building on that subject , this is one thing which could make the biggest difference , if we are serious about it .
one has to ask whether or not the commission is really serious .
not only is a rather weak measure proposed which is discussed in the report .
if you look at the track record of the commission itself , it hardly inspires confidence .
a firm which had been in receipt of both praise and grants from the commission found itself near bankruptcy because for the second time it was facing delays in payment .
so , there was a crisis in that department . if it were not done by christmas eve nothing could be done until the new year .
