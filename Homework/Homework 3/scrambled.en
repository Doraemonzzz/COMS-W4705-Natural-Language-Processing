however , terry pearce from precision components remains sceptical about europe 's involvement .
before the recession in the 1980s they invested in new capital every year and our help has returned them to the path of growth and new competitiveness .
too many of them have told me of the difficulties associated with this scheme .
the easdaq may perhaps start in september and will finally provide a solution within and not outside europe for the rapid-growth advanced high-technology smes .
if others have to pay on time , he will have to as well .
a success story for them but hardly for europe !
in britain as a whole 700 companies have been helped but 650 more applied and were eligible .
the risk that a customer will not pay remains the same .
it would also be a good thing if small firms were allowed to deliver their vat return quarterly or were allowed a longer time for returns .
mr president , i am glad that before dealing with the multiannual programme for smes we can devote a whole morning to these dossiers .
mr president , in supporting today 's proposals in favour of small business i want to bring to this chamber the clear experience of small business in my own constituency .
he puts it plainly when he says that when these companies who are in debt to him pay their salaries they are doing so with his money .
we shall certainly talk about this again in debating the multiannual programme .
i also support the rapporteur , mrs ewing , to the full when she asks for priority attention to those of less than 50 employees .
look at our case once again .
definitely not , in my opinion .
no new money is needed .
it is worth recommending that local and national employers ' organizations should be involved in the information process .
different solutions will have to be applied .
late payments are not infrequently the cause of one or a series of bankruptcies .
in addition , we will enthusiastically try to implement the new loan guarantee scheme , elise , in my area .
as a result we have been able to arrive at a report which has the full approval of my group .
then i come to the european capital market for rapid-growth firms .
mr president , you will certainly allow me to tell the rapporteur that i found his willingness to cooperate exemplary .
i understand that such an institution gives a positive spur to promising firms , but i have one fundamental question : is it the authorities ' job to set up such an exchange ?
how do we solve that ?
commissioner oreja 's answer to my parliamentary question on 13 june when he said that services are provided from norwich or should be sublet from norwich is wholly unacceptable .
and of course i should like to congratulate mr harrison for his splendid report .
finally the problem of the late payments in the european union .
any rules governing payment periods will moreover have to take into account aspects of tax policy - particularly those relating to smes , banking policy , cross-border transfers , industrial policy , business training and business management techniques .
again and again the part they play in economic growth and in the creation of employment is painted in glowing colours - as happened in florence too .
eleven small companies have benefited or become eligible to benefit from south essex since 1994 .
finally , on the european information centres , we receive no service in essex .
with regard to mrs ewing 's report about interest subsidies i notice that relatively few firms with fewer than 250 employees are included .
there is a huge gap to the north of london , in essex , bedfordshire and hertfordshire .
let the essex county council library service be a european information centre .
the lack of knowledge and expert advice and an incomplete internal organization certainly have something to do with this , but also the lack of a position of power in negotiations serves the smes ill .
there will not be nearly so much capital freed as he maintains for investments and employment .
with a recommendation or a directive ?
the arguments for that are too slight .
this morning 's dossiers are an apt illustration of that .
the community initiative for granting interest subsidies on loans was modest but welcome .
the question is whether we can put this right with a directive .
essex has 66 , 000 overseas and uk businesses providing 590 , 000 jobs .
we simply want the title so that we can get access to the information , to the publications and to the network of other centres .
paragraph 6 of the motion for a resolution calls for a directive .
all these organizations are committed to nurturing small and medium-sized companies .
as i said before , the problem of payment periods has no single legal solution and the law cannot be regarded as the only option .
the fundamental political significance of this must naturally not be underestimated , but let us not forget that a policy needs specific action if it is to be of any use .
that makes it all the more pleasing that , if the report draws the right conclusions , the grant of interest subsidies has done more than expected to create new jobs in european smes .
the rapporteur 's argument does not hold water .
finally there is the harrison report about terms of payment .
that is why our initiative to end this scourge of late payments is absolutely right .
mr president , small- and medium-scale businesses should be pleased about the enormous interest of the authorities , at both national and european levels in recent years .
the question is what can the european union do to help us .
that is due particularly to the short period for application .
secondly , i wish to support the continuation of our european programme for intra-subsidy loans to small companies but to call for clear improvements in the way that these loans are administered .
intermediaries should be much clearer about the role of european support and all member states should operate a reserve list system to help eligible companies who were not first in the queue .
the solution to all of this is to ensure that sufficient funds are given to meet the demands and to avoid lengthy delays on the waiting lists .
let me make it clear that bank loans are absolutely crucial to this sector of business and european support with minimum bureaucracy and targeted at job creation is a very effective way of offering support .
personally i have doubted this for a long time and have always advocated harmonization of procedural law , the introduction of simple judicial procedures and encouragement of extrajudicial arbitration procedures .
the sme capital market is another instrument for financing .
at that time i was anxious to reduce the target group to undertakings with fewer than 250 employees .
a single solution is impossible .
small- and mediumscale businesses seem to be the european politicians ' pet child .
since edinburgh it has been the custom for every european council to sing the praises of the small- and medium-scale businesses .
they have their own characteristics and need a specific policy .
the authorities ought simply to remove obstructions and create the necessary legislative preconditions for such an institution .
and efficient information and cooperation networks can give small smes in particular the necessary market access so that they do not to lag behind in terms of efficiency and can participate in the innovative developments .
the rapporteur , mr hendrick , is right to emphasize that service to the smes must be the criterion .
another company , beaver 84 ltd , of basildon was not even told by its intermediary that its application for a financial lease was even on the list for a european subsidy .
that will just be robbing peter to pay paul .
so employers would be better served by a course in how to assess a customer 's credit-worthiness .
more far-reaching proposals would quickly amount to an encroachment on freedom to contract .
let us hope that with everything we do not cuddle small- and medium-scale businesses to death .
i say in advance that i shall not blame the member states if they say they cannot do much with the commission 's recommendation .
the commission did not want to support my amendment but did promise to steer the bulk of the resources to that sector .
i hope elise will give our new loan guarantee system a push in the right direction .
mr president , smes are becoming increasingly important as a means of boosting the economy and reducing the high unemployment figures .
in another arena that would be called fraud and it is shameful that the uk has the worst record of late payments in europe at a dismal average of 23 days .
finally , we must also pay attention to the balanced distribution of the horizontal information and cooperation networks to preclude from the outset any risk of distortions of competition in this area too .
in the organization for independent employers and smes for which i worked for years it was our slogan that smes are not just pocket-sized big business .
europe 's role was hidden from them .
the euro info centres would then have to collaborate closely with that kind of organization .
i am glad to note today that that promise has been kept .
the euro info centres and the cooperation networks are more necessary than ever .
finally small businesses find late payers more than a nuisance .
yet non-payment of invoices presents a real problem to their manager , david stear .
what is happening is that the report on the recommendation has the great advantage of bringing solutions to a specific subject .
the small-scale and frequently the family nature of these businesses means that they have to settle funding problems in a special way .
they are an evil which smes relatively often have to reckon with .
what does the commissioner think of the suggestion of concentrating subsidies for supporting smes on test projects established by the bodies providing services perhaps in collaboration with educational institutions ?
their small scale moreover prevents them from taking in experts in all fields , so that there is a danger of chronic lack of information .
it is not working at the moment in essex .
even though i am in favour of privatization on principle , we must ensure that the proffered information services are simple and affordable for the smes .
there is a real danger of that . so with measures for encouraging smes the accent must be placed on lightening administrative burdens and simpler legislation .
just this week thames estuary plastics of rayleigh has had its interest subsidy from europe confirmed to support twelve new jobs as part of a &pound; 470 , 000 project .
a directive looks very nice for the smes but how will that help an employer ?
firstly , i should like to give the strongest support to action to halt the scourge of late payments which threaten so many of our small businesses .
to improve the sme climate effectively and to make all the solemn declarations credible , measures are needed .
