By
lunchtime
,
the
selling
was
at
near-panic
fever
.

So
it
went
yesterday
in
the
trading
rooms
of
London
's
financial
district
.

And
it
left
mixed
signals
for
London
.

Red

rising
stocks

He
was
right
.

By
midday
,
the
London
market
was
in
full
retreat
.

Conversation
was
subdued
as
most
patrons
watched
the
latest
market
statistics
on
television
.

Suddenly
,
after
about
45
minutes
,
the
U.S.
markets
rallied
.

As
Wall
Street
strengthened
,
the
London
trading
room
went
wild
.

Traders
shouted
as
their
screens
posted
an
ever-narrowing
loss
on
Wall
Street
.

lost
almost
11

Absolutely

Not
surprisingly
,

bites

The
truth
is
,
Washington
understands
politics
better
than
economics
.

The
index
slid
647.33
points
,
or
1.8
%
,
on
Monday
.

The
day
's
decline
was
generally
in
line
with
analysts
'
weekend
predictions
.

Declining
issues
swamped
advancers
,

.

But
volume
was
thin
at
526.2
million
shares
,
compared
with
574.7
million
Friday
.

Thus
,
market
participants
yesterday
were
looking
ahead
nervously
to
Wall
Street
's
opening
.

``
For
us
institutional
investors
,
the
chance
for
buying
has
come
.
''

Other
fund
managers
were
similarly
sanguine
.

Bangkok
,
Manila
,
Seoul
,
Taipei
and
Jakarta
escaped
with
slightly
smaller
losses
.

Trading
was
heavy
at
about
one
billion
shares
,
compared
with
473.9
million
Friday
.

But
volume
rose
only
to
162
million
shares
from
143

Friday
.

The
Financial
Times
30-share
index
closed
79.3

more

doubled

Prices

The

The

here
is
the

Kamp
.

He
's
running
for

.

That
's
also
the
day
of

And
it
allows

Of

the

are
not

First
,
there
was
a
death
watch
.

The
Nasdaq
OTC
index
closed
down
6.31
to
460.98
.

It
's
just
a
strange
feeling
.

But
to
traders
,
it
looked
like
disaster
on
the
9:30
a.m.
opening
bell
.

The
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
opened
down
1.64
shortly
after
9:30
.

The
program
traders
were
in
there
,
too
,
of
course
.

Trading
in
Walt
Disney
Co.
particularly
caught
traders
'
eyes
.

The
stock
opened
late
at
114
1\/2
,
down
8
1\/2
.

It
was
orderly
.

We
put
some

together
.

There
was
n't
a

of
panic

,
either
domestically
or
internationally
...
.

On
the
Big
Board
floor
and
on
trading
desks
,
traders
yelped
their
approval
.

But
not
everybody
was
making
money
.

Merck
is
one
of
the
most
important
stocks
in
the
Major

.

And
yesterday
,
the
top
performing

group
was

equipment

Shares
of
three
brokerage
firms
rose
after
they
reported
earnings
.

Mr.
Phelan
expressed
relief
that
the
market
rebounded
yesterday
.

They
used
their
judgment
.

They
did
n't
panic
during
the
first
round
of
selling
this
morning
.

Maybe
they
learned
from
experience
.

Wall
Street
traders
on
Friday
had
complained
about
the
trading
suspensions

James

contributed
to
this
article

,
some
economists
contend
that
the

started
last

The
reversal
was
even
more
evident
among
shorter-term
Treasury
securities
.

Investment-grade
corporate
bonds
,
mortgage-backed
securities
and
municipal
bonds
also
fell
.

But
as
Japanese
stocks
rebounded
,
Treasurys
retreated
and
ended
just
modestly
higher

It

do
damage
to
us

``

Treasury
Securities

Prices
of
Treasury
bonds
tumbled
in
moderate
to
active
trading
.

The
yield
on
the
benchmark
issue
rose

7.97
%

7.82

Short-term

rates
fell
yesterday
at

Thus
,
higher
bidding
narrows
the

lower
bidding
widens
it
