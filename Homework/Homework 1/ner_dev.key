the O

the O

Hill I-PER

Pakistani I-MISC
: O
" O
You O
cheat O

" O

" O
He O
was O
standing O
right O
there O

knew O

shot O

down O

I O
called O
him O

" O
said O
Hill I-PER
, O
whose O

been O
blighted O
by O
fines O

suspensions O
for O
unacceptable O
behaviour O

" O
He O
knew O
it O

" O

Hill I-PER
won O
the O
game O
on O

said O

that O
Jansher I-PER
was O
generally O
honest O
on O
court O
but O
played O
by O
the O
referee O

decision O

The O
Australian I-MISC
had O
upset O
Jansher I-PER

rhythm O
with O
his O
mixture O
of O
gamesmanship O
and O
fluent O
stroke-making O
but O
eventually O
succumbed O

14-15 O

" O
I O
changed O
my O
strategy O

him O
rattled O

he O
added O

He O
is O
not O

he O
used O
to O
be O

was O
too O
good O
for O
me O
in O
the O
end O

I O
shook O
him O
a O
bit O
but O
he O
will O
come O
out O
next O
time O
and O
be O
a O
better O
player O
for O
it O
-- O
that O

Jansher O
. O
" O

Jansher I-PER
said O
that O
he O
was O
disturbed O
to O
be O
called O
a O
cheat O
. O
" O

What O
he O
did O
was O
bad O
for O

bad O
for O

bad O
for O

" O
We O
